Many startups dream about going public. It allows them to raise much more capital than from private equity investors and venture capital firms. Equity mutual funds in the US alone manage US$8.4 trillion domestically- that’s six times the comparable value handled by buyout funds and 18 times what venture capital oversee.Recently, there seems to be a rush for an initial public offering among tech startups. Among US companies, some of the biggest-ever tech IPOs by capital raised took place in 2020. Food delivery platform DoorDash and vacation rental firm Airbnb listed last December, while software provider Snowflake went public in September.Sea listed on NYSE / Photo credit: NYSEIn Asia, some tech startups that did an IPO last year include short-video platform and TikTok rival Kuaishou, which raised US$5.4 billion in its Hong Kong listing in January 2021, and JD.com, which raised US$3.8 billion in its secondary listing, also in Hong Kong.Asian firms are increasingly opting for IPOs as tech stocks boomed amid the pandemic. As such, several startups in the region are looking to strike while the iron’s hot.Tech in Asia’s analysis shows that 95 tech startups across China, India, and Southeast Asia are reportedly planning for an IPO this year and beyond. Out of this number, 40 startups could collectively raise over US$27.83 billion.However, this figure could potentially surpass US$23.24 billion since heavyweights like Traveloka and ByteDance haven’t set or disclosed their target fundraising amounts.Most of the Asian startups looking to list on the bourses come from the ecommerce space, followed by fintech, artificial intelligence, and ride-hailing.Our analysis also shows that the US is one of the most sought-after destinations for these companies, especially for Southeast Asian firms. This isn’t surprising, given the success of New York Stock Exchange-listed Sea Group, which currently has a market valuation of over US$120 billion. That’s several times larger than any of the top tech firms in the region.Meanwhile, most Indian companies are choosing to go public in their home markets, except for Walmart-owned ecommerce player Flipkart, fintech merchants platform Pine Labs, and advertising tech startup InMobi, which want to list on the US stock market.Following the US and Indian markets is the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, which is seeing more homecoming listings from Chinese firms. This is a change from a few years earlier, when Chinese companies favored listing on the US stock exchanges.One reason for this could be the heightened political tensions between China and the US, which drove Chinese tech firms to seek out exchanges closer to home.These companies could also be concerned about being removed from US stock markets. Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, one of China’s major chipmakers, ceased its trading shares in the US in January after it was added to a trade blacklist by the US government.In December 2020, the US House of Representatives passed a bill that allows the delisting of Chinese firms that don’t let US inspectors review their auditors’ work for three consecutive years. The legislation was adopted by the US Securities and Exchange Commission in March.Soaring SPACsSome startups are choosing a different route to go public. Last year, blank-check or special purpose acquisition companies (SPAC) IPOs accounted for most of the growth in the IPO market in the US compared to 2019.Listing via a SPAC is less time-consuming, taking around six months instead of the usual six to nine months for a traditional IPO. Going the blank-check route also offers upfront liquidity and greater certainty around valuation.While only a minority of firms are considering a SPAC, some of Southeast Asia’s leading tech startups, such as Traveloka and GoTo Group, are taking this alternative. The only company outside the region that might opt to merge with a blank-check firm for a US listing is India’s Flipkart.As soon as these tech startups go public, their early investors can finally cash out and make a fortune.Doris Yu had initially worked on this story.","There are over 95 tech startups across the region planning an IPO, and 40 of them could collectively raise over US$27.83 billion.",470877,Deepti Sri,True,"Collin Furtado, Terence Lee, and Eileen C.

Additionally, we’re commemorating International Women’s Day this week on Tech in Asia. You can find the great content around the occasion here.Hello reader,You have to hand it to Mark Zuckerberg. When the Facebook founder chose to rename the company’s parent firm to Meta Platforms to build an alternate digital world known as the metaverse, he was mercilessly criticized.He was considered just another middle-aged tech billionaire chasing a childhood dream, similar to what Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and Tesla’s Elon Musk did with space rockets.And yet his timing was impeccable. While Wall Street has been fanning the hype, Southeast Asia has witnessed the quiet rise of metaverse builder RFox. The bootstrapped startup, which was launched right before the crypto boom, plans to create localized metaverses in the region.In today’s big story, my colleague Nikita decodes the metaverse possibilities through RFox.Today we look at:A Southeast Asian startup that has a well-stocked arsenal in the race to build metaversesA record number of investments flowing into one of Asia’s fast-emerging sectorsOther newsy highlights such as Grab’s latest quarterly results, and a Singapore-based social investment platform’s expansion plans.P.S.: Tech in Asia is celebrating International Women’s Day this week with lots of great content on the site – keep an eye out for it!Premium summaryThe future is hereImage credit: Timmy LoenRFox founder Ben Fairbank describes his version of a metaverse as a big box with hooks, where anyone can plug any application or blockchain into the box.While the Vietnam-headquartered company has been flying under the radar all this while, it may step into the limelight once it launches an immersive retail and entertainment-centric metaverse to the public sometime in the middle of the year.RFox also has a well-stocked arsenal in the battle to build metaverses, where 25% of people will fancy spending at least one hour a day for work, shopping, education, social, or entertainment purposes.Going places: The Valt is a global virtual reality metaverse. RFox aims to create localized Valts next, starting with the Philippines later this year and then moving on to Vietnam and Indonesia. Services such as food courts, clothing businesses, and billboard advertisements will be locally influenced.Deal town: RFox has a tie-up with Lazada Philippines for cashback and rewards that will go live once the Valt is open. The partnership will focus on ecommerce livestreaming, where Lazada will offer an 8% cashback to RFox for every purchase through the livestream content. The metaverse startup is also looking for people who can bring value regarding networking or partnerships.Metaverse user manual: The Valt is looking to attract traffic to its four quarters. Auctions for the virtual plots of two of these areas – the art-focused quarter Callinova and gaming district Arkamoto – are already over. RFox wants to help businesses set up shop in its virtual world without the need to worry about building an audience from scratch.Read more: The quiet rise of a startup that sold $2.5m of virtual landNews spotlightFleshing out alternative proteinsAsia Pacific is fast emerging as a hotbed for alternative protein startups, with record investments flowing into the sector. Annual capital invested in the region’s alternative protein startups grew by 92% to US$312 million in 2021.Top dog: Some of the biggest deals in Asia Pacific last year include Singapore-based Next Gen Foods scooping up a record-breaking US$30 million in seed funding and Australia-based V2food raising US$110 million in its series B round.Funding flow: Startups in the plant-based category dominated investments, securing nearly 70% of funds flowing into Asia Pacific’s alternative protein sector. Firms in this category also secured more money compared to their peers in other regions. Meanwhile, startups in the cultivated meat and fermentation categories received 20% and 10% of investments in the region, respectively.Vegan unicorns: Asia is said to have the potential to become a bona fide hotbed of alternative protein unicorns. Meanwhile, North America may become a minority player in the global plant-based meat sector this year – a far cry from when it once accounted for almost 100% of the world’s alternative protein investments.In partnership withFighting the changing face of fraudFor as long as there’s been money to be made, fraud has existed, going from tactics like counterfeit money and fake checks to new strategies like identity fraud and promo abuse. As Southeast Asia continues to digitalize, more people are coming online for the first time, creating more opportunities for fraudsters.According to a report by GrabDefence and Forrester, seven out of 10 surveyed organizations experienced fraud in the last 12 months, significantly impacting their businesses. And as firms try to fight fraud, they have to strike a balance between preventing major risks and keeping the customer journey frictionless.Sign up for GrabDefence’s upcoming webinar, The State of Fraud in Southeast Asia 2022: Insights To Protect Your Business.

In fact, we’ve had to constantly rescript and add stuff to this episode because so many things kept coming to our attention during the production process.Here to break things down is my colleague, Arpit Nayak.Arpit Nayak (VO):A Vietnamese restaurant owner saves his business during the pandemic by making money on cryptocurrency trading. A visual artist in India makes over US$7,000 on a single NFT. VCs across the region are raising hundreds of millions of dollars to set up funds focused on investing in blockchain technology.The Asian tech scene has recently been obsessed with all things blockchain and crypto. Call it a resurgence: the past two years have seen the most widespread adoption of the technology since the crypto winter of 2018.And what’s interesting is that different markets have had varying reasons for catching crypto fever. The catalyst for adoption in Vietnam, for instance, was gaming. The emergence of Sky Mavis’ blockchain-powered game Axie Infinity marked the country as a hotspot on the global crypto map when it racked up close to 2 million daily active users sometime last year.But the reason for gaming being such a crucial factor for the Vietnam crypto boom can be attributed to another Vietnamese game that took the world by storm in 2014. Here’s Tech in Asia journalist Thu Huong Le on the matter.Thu Huong Le:Before Axie infinity, we had Flappy Bird, which was also a global phenomenon. Flappy Bird actually had 50 million downloads in 2014, which I also wrote about back then.The game’s developer ended up killing off Flappy Bird because he couldn’t handle the pressure, but just to note that Axie infinity just reflects that Vietnam has a very strong gaming culture. Our first tech unicorn is VNG, which specializes in game publishing.Arpit Nayak (VO):That gaming culture, coupled with a robust pool of developers in the country, meant that Vietnam was the ideal breeding ground for Axie Infinity to achieve unprecedented success.Thu Huong Le:So it had, like, phenomenal success in the Philippines, where some players there managed to own, like, enough money to buy houses. But certainly, in order to play Axie, you have to learn how to buy Axies, you have to learn about crypto. But certainly, GameFi can be the beginning of, you know, people’s crypto journey, but it’s not everything.Arpit Nayak (VO):To add to that perfect storm, Vietnam’s tech-savvy population, the dampening of other investment channels, as well as the lockdowns due to Covid-19 further drove crypto adoption in the country.Thu Huong Le:So, similar to other countries, in Vietnam, the ways to invest, like real estate and gold, have been hit hard by lockdowns, interest rates have been very low. So for the older generation, like my mother, investment has always been real estate and gold, but for the Gen Z and millennials, who are online more and more because of the pandemic and have more incentive to find ways to make money, obviously, crypto is very appealing.Also, as a lot of people told me and I point out in the article, crypto is really trendy. The starting capital is small and, also, the Gen Z and millennials really find NFTs, blockchain, and web 3 to be very attractive – the stock market is not flexible enough for them and it doesn’t have the attractiveness of such technology.Arpit Nayak (VO):What that led to is almost 6 million people in Vietnam owning a digital asset, putting the country among the top five in the world in terms of crypto adoption – a stunning figure for what is still primarily a cash-based society.In fact, crypto’s penetrated Vietnam’s population so deeply that even the threat of scams doesn’t stop traders from trying to make a quick buck.Thu Huong Le:There’s actually scams in lending and also crypto being reported by local media. There have been, like, a few projects here that are totally scams. But scams are everywhere, it can happen in all sectors.For Vietnamese adopters, I think Vietnamese people have a very strong entrepreneurial spirit. Making money online has become, like, so trendy. So the hardcore traders, as I say, are willing to take these risks.I talked to one of the young traders, he is friends with experts who can suggest him projects and who suggests him what to buy, how the market’s going to fluctuate and, also, as I point out in my article, the Vietnamese crypto adopters are very community-based. So they share tips in order how to avoid scams and you can attend these online forums to ask people, but obviously, you have to make the final decision and you have to manage the risks. I mean, that’s part of the challenge of being a crypto adopter, I guess.Arpit Nayak (VO):Over in India, the tale of the country’s ride onto the crypto wave goes a little differently. Here’s Tech in Asia journalist Nikita Puri’s take on it.Nikita Puri:So I think the first few headlines that I saw, I just brushed past them, I wasn’t really interested. But then it seemed like after a while, I couldn’t skip them anymore. They were just about everywhere. And that’s when I started looking closely at my Twitter thread, at social media in general, and I realized that India was really getting hooked onto NFTs.Arpit Nayak (VO):An NFT or non-fungible token is a unique representation of an asset on a blockchain supported by a smart contract. Tech in Asia’s Originals team actually produced an explainer video on it some time back if you want to learn more – links below – but essentially, NFTs allow people to verifiably say that they own a digital asset such as a piece of art, for example.But on top of using NFTs to own art, people in India were buying NFTs driven by celebrities.Autographs, poem recitals, movie posters, anything tied to sports stars or actors were getting NFT-ed – and they were selling fast.Nikita Puri:India just has this really close relationship with celebrities – any celebrity worth their salt, whether they be cricketers or if they are film stars – doesn’t quite matter because the fan base for it is really big, really dedicated, and really committed.It doesn’t matter if they played a bad match or if their last film was a flop. It’s about the legacy, the vibe around the actor or the cricketer that sort of has led to this whole NFT craze also.And for the celebrities themselves, it doesn’t take much because they’re capitalizing, they’re monetizing on the legacy that they have already built.Arpit Nayak (VO):And it’s not just the celebrities who stand to earn a pretty sum from this NFT craze, as Nikita calls it. Those who buy NFTs actually have a chance of making bank too, as in the case of those who bought NFTs of a film directed by renowned filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma last year.Nikita Puri:So basically what happened was, basically, the people who bought NFTs of that Ram Gopal Varma film, unless they want to trade it and sell it off, they will forever hold that particular entity – it’s theirs, they own that film.Now, what has happened is, that film has actually been picked up by distributors. So now, when perhaps, you know, the world gets better and more people start going to cinema halls, that film might actually come out in the theaters. And when that happens, these people who have bought those NFTs, they will also get a part of the revenues that come out of this film.Arpit Nayak (VO):Aside from these celebrity-tagged NFTs, tokens of indigenous art are also being minted.Nikita Puri:So, you know, we talked about celebrities sort of driving the NFT wave in India, but I think it’s also really significant to realize that there is another sort of trend developing in India where we are focusing on indigenous art. Homegrown NFT marketplaces distinctly have a local appeal and this is set to grow in the art NFT market. On WazirX, for example, there are a lot of artists putting up NFTs of certain tribal art.So basically, you know, these experiments with traditional art, which may not have otherwise found such an access to a whole different market altogether, is something that’s very, very interesting to me. A lot of platforms are tying up with, you know, historical places or sites with historical importance, and bringing them out as NFTs.For example, there was the warrior kingdom of Mysore where, you know, India had kings and queens and princes. The prince is still there and he’s tied up with an NFT marketplace to bring out artworks which are inspired by the history of the kingdom. And it was this glorious kingdom at one point in time. That is another direction this thing is headed into.Arpit Nayak (VO):We’ll be right back.[Ever wished you had a one-stop resource for all things tech in Asia?

Head on over to techin.asia/sub and join the club. I’ll see you there. But now, on with the show.]Arpit Nayak (VO):Despite the rapid adoption that cryptocurrency and NFTs have seen in the region, the industry faces an eventual roadblock in the form of local government regulations. For instance, in 2018, the State Bank of Vietnam banned cryptocurrency-related transactions via the banking system.Thu Huong Le:It’s really hard to know exactly how Vietnam would regulate crypto. But the state bank has been tasked with studying crypto, and potentially there will be a pilot program. It’s also unclear what this pilot program will include.But it’s still very early and it’s going to take quite some time for regulators here – not just here, but also Southeast Asia and the world – to actually understand how to regulate it. For Vietnam, our regulators are very protective of the traditional financial system, which makes sense because we need to protect our economy, right?Arpit Nayak (VO):The state of regulation in India isn’t clear either. In 2018, regulators similarly barred banks from dealing with crypto exchanges, hampering the growth of crypto-related startups in the country. Though the ban was lifted in 2020, the country still lacks a legal framework surrounding these companies.Then last month, India’s finance minister proposed a 30% tax on digital assets.Nikita Puri:It is a massive speed bump, actually. Because if I’m looking to quickly take out my money, if I’m doing it just for the sake of earning a living, I don’t think it’s very feasible. A 30% tax is quite high.We’re also a little unclear about the whole legal aspect of it because after the ministry announced that there’s going to be tax, two days later they said crypto is not legal in the country. So that, again, sent heads scratching and people are wondering what does it mean, you know, really, where do we stand? A lot of people feel like we’ve gone one step ahead, but two steps behind.Arpit Nayak (VO):But why exactly are regulators hesitant to implement clear legislations for cryptocurrency? And why are the policies so harsh when governments do regulate the industry? My colleague, Melissa Goh, might have the answer.Melissa Goh:I feel like when it comes to crypto regulation – and I think this is Singapore’s stance on it – is that we’re still in early days in terms of regulation. So I think no regulator, no government is in a rush to implement the sort of legislation or rules there for firms. And I feel like most governments have adopted this cautious approach where they are just trying to one-up each other, but just slightly.So in Singapore’s case, it has started offering licenses to firms, so firms are welcome to apply, but it hasn’t fully opened the doors. But from the regulator standpoint, there is no rush to give 100 firms a license to provide those kinds of services today.Arpit Nayak (VO):This approach to legislation has led to major crypto industry players like Binance to withdraw their applications for a license in the city-state in favor of setting up shop in Dubai, which has been far more crypto friendly.But while that may seem like a loss for Singapore, there are some drawbacks to being too early an adopter of emerging tech like crypto.Melissa Goh:I think there’s definitely a first-mover advantage, but I think the risks of that are huge, right? The risks of being a first mover and making a huge misstep, and the probability of that happening, it’s pretty large. And in some ways, I wouldn’t say that Singapore is losing out.Like in the grand scheme of things, if you look at the kinds of regulations that have been rolled out in other jurisdictions around the world, whether it’s in the US, Europe, other parts of Asia, I think Singapore can still very much be considered – if not the first mover – one of the first movers still. So I don’t think Singapore sees itself as losing out in that aspect. And at the same time, I think Singapore would rather be cautious than to be a first mover and then be exposed to those kinds of risks.And I think I’ll quote someone here, Ravi Menon from the Monetary Authority of Singapore. He said this last November, and I quote, “We don’t need 160 of them to set up shop here” – referring to crypto providers – “half of them can do so, but with very high standards. That, I think, is a better outcome.” And I think that perfectly sums up Singapore’s stance on that.Arpit Nayak (VO):It does feel like a bit of a chicken or egg situation. With regulators across the region still waiting and watching the crypto scene for developments before making a move, many startups in the industry are left waiting and watching before they can innovate to the technology’s fullest potential.But with the looming web 3 and metaverse opportunity on the horizon, more leading tech companies across the globe are sure to realize blockchain’s potential. Then, it’ll only be a matter of time before legislators have to act.For more stories on cryptocurrency, NFTs, blockchain technology, or any of the various other rising industries within Asia’s tech and startup scene, visit techin.asia/sub to become a Tech in Asia subscriber or you could also subscribe to this podcast where we’re running Deep Dives every month.But that’s it for this episode.

Delivered every Monday via email and through the Tech in Asia website, this free newsletter breaks down the biggest stories and latest trends on Asia’s publicly listed tech companies. If you’re not a subscriber, get access by registering here.Hello reader,It was that week in the quarter again, when the household names from Southeast Asia’s tech industry revealed their GDP-sized earnings results, along with guidance on their near to medium-term financial prospects.Usually, these events signal the strength of tech businesses in the region, but this time around, it left investors wanting more, way more.These closely watched reports not only provide an insightful view into the current state of a company’s operations but also often send investors either scampering to buy or sell stock and, generally, form the basis of ratings and price target recommendations by Wall Street analysts.Image credit: Timmy LoenIt’s only fitting to kick off discussions on the recent earnings reports with that of the poster child of Southeast Asian tech businesses: Grab (GRAB, NDAQ). Founded in 2012, the super app has experienced something of a fall from grace since its market debut in December.A sudden surge of investor optimism heading into its Q4 earnings report quickly went up in smoke, with the Singapore-headquartered firm’s shares plunging well over a third of its value, or roughly 37%, after posting its results.Grab’s Q4 results hardly paint a pretty picture and, perhaps, has justified investor skepticism over its stock in recent months.It may be the case that CEO Anthony Tan’s grand plan for Grab needs more time to bear fruit, but the market has no patience under the current macro environment. Grab’s share price has fallen about 70% in the last three months. You can find an in-depth review of Grab’s financial health here.Another company with a strong claim to being the face of Southeast Asian tech firms’ rapid rise is Sea Group (SE, NYSE), which fared mildly better than its counterpart. This is hardly conciliatory, given that the firm has trimmed over US$130 billion in market value from its peak last November, while its share price hit new 52-week lows last week.Sea shed about US$10.4 billion in market value after slashing its year-on-year booking guidance for its digital entertainment unit Garena for the first time. India’s ban on Free Fire has been a thorn in Sea’s share price, but as my colleague Simon reports in this premium story, there are glimmers of hope that Sea can pull itself out of a deep hole.Over in China, Baidu’s (BIDU, NDAQ) investors would be forgiven for fearing the worst after Alibaba’s (BABA, NDAQ) disappointing earnings last month.However, the search engine, whose stock price has shown resilience in the face of China’s big tech crackdown, bucked the trend. Its rise in quarterly revenue was warmly embraced by the market. Baidu’s share price rose immediately following results, but eventually succumbed to broad market-wide weakness to end the week down nearly 4%.— Shravanth4 Stocks to watchHot stocks, earnings reports, restructuring, activist investor pressure, and more. We feature the stocks that are likely to make big moves during the week.NIO ES6 electric SUV semi-autonomous car on display / Photo credit: 123rf.com🇨🇳 Nio Inc (NIO, NYSE): The Chinese electric vehicle maker plans to carry out secondary listings by introduction in Hong Kong and Singapore. The firm has received preliminary approval from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, where its shares are due to trade on March 10, and the Singapore Exchange is reviewing its application.Concerns over being forced off the US exchanges amid China’s tech crackdown likely stoked these moves. Nio’s primary listing will remain in New York for now. Additionally, the company reported 6,131 vehicle deliveries in February, up 9.9% year over year but down 36% sequentially. The stock has more than halved in value over the last six months.🇮🇩 Bukalapak (BUKA, IDX): This ecommerce giant became the first Indonesian unicorn to list on the country’s stock exchange last year. However, since its market debut, the company’s shares have fallen nearly 70%.In an attempt to reverse its fortunes, Bukalapak looks to launch its e-grocery business, AlloFresh. The new venture will launch with around US$69.7 million from Bukalapak, Growtheum Capital Partners, and Trans Retail Indonesia – a local offline retailer owned by conglomerate CT Corp Group.🇲🇾 Capital A (CAPITALA, KLSE): When AirAsia rebranded itself as Capital A in January, it was a statement by the company that it was seeking to expand its services beyond its core airline and cargo delivery businesses. From unveiling AirAsia Ride to launching its food delivery service in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand, Capital A has made significant leaps in realizing its super-app ambitions.Now, it is taking its financial product marketplace, AirAsia Money, to Indonesia. It has partnered with local insurance startup PasarPolis, investment app Bareksa, donation platform Rumah Zakat, and payment service Wise in the release of the new service.🇯🇵 Panasonic Corp (6752, TYO): A long-time supplier for Tesla Inc (TSLA, NDAQ), the electric vehicle (EV) battery maker plans to begin mass-producing a new type of lithium-ion battery for Tesla before the end of March 2024 with two new production lines at its western Japanese plant in Wakayama.Panasonic is looking to double down on its partnership with Tesla, which stretches back over a decade, as it looks to invest several billions of dollars to build a mega factory in the US to support the US EV behemoth.3 Market whispersA lot more reliable than whispers, we highlight engaging source-based reporting from reputable news outlets around the globe.Image credit: Timmy Loen1️⃣ No IPO pain, no IPO gain: China’s most popular fitness app, Keep Inc, has filed for an IPO in Hong Kong after it reportedly pulled the plug on a US$500 million listing on US stock exchanges. The pricing and size of the IPO are yet to be determined.Keep becomes the latest high-profile Chinese firm to have its IPO plans disrupted after Beijing’s rising scrutiny of overseas listings pushed social networking platform Soul and podcasting app Ximalaya to shelve their US listing plans.2️⃣ Musk brothers in hot water: Tesla CEO Elon Musk and his brother, Kimbal Musk, are being investigated by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on whether their recent stock sales violated the commission’s insider-trading rules.The SEC’s investigation began last year after Kimbal sold shares of Tesla, valued at US$108 million, one day before Elon polled Twitter users asking whether he should unload 10% of his stake in the electric car maker and pledging to abide by the vote’s results. The company’s shares fell sharply in the wake of Elon’s poll, with 58% of voters saying he should sell.3️⃣ A truce on the offing? For over a year, Amazon (AMZN, NDAQ) and Future Retail (FRETAIL, NSE) have been in an intense legal tussle that has stalled Future’s US$3.4 billion sale of assets to Reliance Industries (RELIANCE, NSE). In fact, the stand-off showed no signs of abating with reports claiming Amazon planned to launch criminal court proceedings against Future Retail.However, in what appears to be a dramatic U-turn by both parties, there are now ongoing talks over an out-of-court settlement proposal. The two parties have until March 15 to explore a settlement via negotiations.2 Eye-popping facts 👀Tech in Asia scours the internet to bring you the head-turning numbers from the world of business.US$31 billion – That is the minimum market value at which GoTo Group plans to go public. The Indonesian tech giant has fixed an upper limit of US$42.7 billion in market value and is looking to raise around US$1.5 billion to US$2 billion through an IPO.US$16 billion – That’s how much South Korea’s Hyundai Motor Co (005380, KRX) plans to invest in electric vehicle-related businesses through 2030. However this number pales in comparison to the other big automakers around the world. For instance, Toyota (7203, TYO) plans to invest US$35 billion by 2030 in its EV business, and General Motors (GM, NYSE) aims to put in US$35 billion through 2025.The 1 you didn’t see comingWe spotlight the unusual, not-your-everyday kind of story that has got everyone talking and social media buzzing over the past week.Image credit: 123rf.comFeng Shui master foresaw 1MDB misery: There has been something about spirituality and finance in the world off late. After the news that the former National Stock Exchange (NSE) CEO regularly consulted a yogi to help run India’s largest stock exchange took the internet by storm, a former Goldman Sachs (GS, NYSE) banker, closely tied to the 1MDB scandal, admitted to consulting a feng shui master to see if more trouble lay ahead over the next decade.Tim Leissner, the US government’s key witness in the trial of former Goldman colleague Roger Ng over the multibillion-dollar scam to loot Malaysia’s wealth fund, said the feng shui master’s report predicted that “I would have an issue with authorities for the first half of the 10 years but then it would be resolved.”The ex-banker would also consult the master on a range of matters, from the women in his life to the arrangement of his offices in Asia.For those readers looking to jump from a weird story to a wholesome one, maybe the tale of this extraordinary centenarian will help you overcome your Monday blues.That’s it for this edition – we hope you liked it!Not your cup of tea?

He also contributes to Tech in Asia.In January, disgruntled investors in the US sued celebrities such as reality TV star Kim Kardashian, former boxing champion Floyd Mayweather, and ex-NBA player Paul Pierce after a cryptocurrency they promoted shed roughly about 97% of its value.For many in Singapore, this incident might be entertainment fodder. For a few others, however, this scenario may hit a little too close to home. After all, some social media influencers in the city-state have also been promoting digital coins to their followers that ultimately lost most of their value.One such influencer is Ryan Tan, who was previously embroiled in a public spat with his ex-wife Sylvia Chan. The couple co-founded Night Owl Cinematics, a YouTube channel and production firm known for its lifestyle and comedy videos.Ryan Tan, Singapore’s “Crypto King” / Photo credit: Ryan TanThese incidents, in light of the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s recent ban on crypto-related advertising, raise questions about the legality and ethics of influencers promoting cryptocurrency, which is rife with scams and pump-and-dump schemes.The birth of the “Crypto King”While his feud with Chan was playing out in the media in late 2021, Tan started posting about crypto on his Instagram stories. In them, he shared about his two-week foray into non-fungible tokens or NFTs and play-to-earn (P2E) gaming.Tan also included a link to help his followers set up accounts on the popular Metamask crypto wallet as well as two other centralized crypto exchanges (CEXes). He promoted his own crypto Telegram group – which he later named “Crypto King” – to his followers, encouraging them to join so they can start their crypto journey with his guidance. (He runs a separate social media channel called Reno King that focuses on home renovations.)In the next few stories, Tan talked about two P2E games that he was playing and gave brief pointers about their pros and cons.The first game he introduced was Bomb Crypto.Tan also shared a price chart of $BCoin, the native token of the Bomb Crypto game that players will earn. Of course, this is after said players have invested an initial sum of capital to even start playing the game.At the time of Tan’s sharing, $BCoin was trading at S$9.48.The second game that Tan mentioned was CryptoMines, which was growing immensely popular at the time.Like what he did for Bomb Crypto, Tan shared the price chart of $Eternal, the native token of CryptoMines.However, his posts about CryptoMines have since been deleted.At the time of Tan’s sharing, $Eternal was trading at S$794.He also set up more Telegram groups and asked his followers to join them. One of the channels was named after Bomb Crypto’s $BCoin.How Crypto King bombedWhat happened next was unfortunate but not unexpected.A few weeks after Tan invited followers to invest their hard-earned money into the two P2E games he promoted, CryptoMines’ $Eternal took a sharp dive.At the time of writing, $Eternal is trading at around S$0.60. Tan was shilling the token back when it was priced at S$794, which means that it had lost over 99.9% of its value just a few weeks after he introduced it to his followers.“Not my fault”In early January, I stumbled across Tan’s promotion of these P2E games because a friend shared them with me.I was alarmed by how Tan appeared to have no idea what he was getting his followers into, and yet he was positioning himself as their guide in the crypto space. That’s why I called him out on his actions in my Instagram posts.I pointed out that two weeks is not enough experience for anyone to become an expert in the crypto space and that what he did was harmful not just to his followers (as many of them would likely lose their money due to his recommendations) but also to the crypto space at large.As CryptoMines had already crashed at that point of time, I was only able to caution people that Bomb Crypto’s $BCoin, which Tan had also been shilling, was very likely caught in a death spiral that would be difficult – even impossible – to recover from.Tan responded to my posts by saying this on Instagram:A few social media users warned Tan that he had to be more responsible in promoting tokens to his followers, especially when it involved P2E games that have Ponzi scheme-like structures where latecomers to the scene like his followers will likely lose out to the early adopters like Tan himself.Tan replied that he’s only discussing Bomb Crypto’s “current state and [his] opinions of it,” stressing that he can’t control what others decide to do. “It’s like blaming the internet because your kids went to watch porn on it. It’s what they choose to do with the tool and information 😂,” he pointed out.“By the way, I’m not paid nor sponsored by bomb crypto (I wish though) I was really just sharing from my point of view hahahah so if it offends you, I’m really sorry! 😢,” he added.A few weeks after this online confrontation happened, $BCoin plummeted by a massive 97.9% of its value and was trading at around S$0.50 at the time of writing.In comparison, blue-chip cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum lost no more than half their value during the same period.Since the collapse of $BCoin, Tan has stopped posting about Bomb Crypto and has not appeared at all in the Crypto King (bcoin) chat for two months now. He has not responded to Tech in Asia’s multiple requests for comment.Problematic movesTan’s actions may be problematic for a few reasons.Lack of knowledge about the P2E spaceFirst, judging from Tan’s posts, it’s possible that he has no clue about what P2E games truly entail. Given how he was only in the crypto space for two weeks before he began sharing, this is to be expected.As such, Tan isn’t in a position to offer any advice regarding P2E investments. Further, according to people who have been embedded in the crypto space for much longer than Tan, P2E games may actually be one of the worst ways for beginners to get started in crypto.“The current P2E ecosystem is still pretty undeveloped and are just various iterations of Axie Infinity, which was the earliest successful P2E game,” Edmund Chua, a crypto hedge fund manager, tells Tech in Asia.He also noted that unlike traditional games, most P2E games now are “a grind fest and lack an element of fun,” featuring “repetitive gameplay with poor graphics” designed to let users earn money via items or tokens. They also “heavily incentivize early users by providing unsustainable high rewards at the start,” which then taper off as more people who want additional income sign up.Chua continues: “The Ponzi aspect comes when new users are required to buy tokens or game items from existing users in order to play the game for income. I do feel that most new users are unaware that rewards will be gradually diluted and are spending money without fully considering the sustainability of the rewards.”Gabriel Foo, formerly of Delphi Labs and now a senior research analyst at crypto exchange Bybit, agrees with Chua. “P2E games are basically yield farms [a form of crypto lending] with more steps. People play them for the financial incentive and not because of the game and how fun it is. This is inherently unsustainable as the growth slows down and demand cannot keep up as more players want to make a profit.”The allure of fast money can be hard for people to resist, according to Jowella Lim, head of growth at SolanaFM, an indexer of the Solana blockchain. “Multilevel marketing mechanics and poor designs are pushed out before ensuring that the playing aspect is attractive.”She adds: “The current underlying games for P2E concepts are still horrible and it’s a very nascent space – no one truly understands the best way to integrate the two concepts. The moment the economic incentives start to fall, we tend to see spirals where users gradually exit and there’s no re-entering because there are no social factors that keep these players attached.”According to Chua, P2E games can become sustainable by introducing free ways to play and creating a game that’s actually fun.P2E games should also try to “create a sustainable revenue flow from all users to enhance gameplay instead of making spending essential,” he argues. “For example, the use of game items in the form of cosmetics have been a major revenue generator for traditional games like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and Dota.”Inability to conduct on-chain analysisTan’s supposed ignorance may extend to his failure to read on-chain signs portending trouble for the digital coins he was pushing.On-chain signs refer to data points that Tan could have easily derived from looking at the transaction activities of CryptoMines and Bomb Crypto users that are immutably logged onto the blockchain. These signs that would have definitely warned him about the inevitable collapse of both games.“$BCoin was more or less doomed to crash in price; there was no two ways about it,” Wen Jie Lim, principal trader at Floating Point Group, tells Tech in Asia.In early December, when $BCoin was trading at a relatively healthy price point of around S$6 (still down a significant 37% from when Tan promoted it, though), there were already some clear on-chain indications of trouble.For one, the increasingly larger and above-average volumes around price highs at that time seemed to signal distributive price action from large-bag holders – aka whales – who appeared to be selling their much lower-priced tokens at the top.Also, in consulting $BCoin’s Block Explorer, an online tool that stores the details of all the transactions that have ever taken place on a particular blockchain network, one thing becomes obvious. Most of the top holders at that time were exhibiting a pattern of increasing holdings on one day, then immediately cutting them the next day.These actions usually only mean two things: Either the top holders are trading their $BCoin actively or more likely, they are selling their coins to fishes, or smaller buyers who have weaker holding power.Finally, in looking at $BCoin’s Token Contract Overview chart, one can see that the number of transactions were spiking up in tandem with the total number of unique wallets at that time, further backing the thesis that whales were indeed selling their holdings to fishes.When all these elements are considered along with how Bomb Crypto was going to unlock some 46 million $BCoin tokens from the fourth quarter of 2021, Tan should have known that this was not going to be a sustainable game and that getting his followers to pour money into it like he did was akin to him grooming them to become his exit liquidity.Lessons to be learnedWhile it’s too late to do anything about the crashed tokens and lost capital, some lessons can be learned from this mess.First, influencers have to acknowledge that their words do hold weight. Granted, in lifestyle segments like food or home renovation, where Tan is also an influencer, the repercussions for such predicaments may not be as severe. In a space like crypto, however, the stakes are entirely different. Things can turn ugly quickly, and too often, they have.As such, crypto influencers should have relevant expertise before even promoting anything. For instance, if Tan had the pertinent knowledge of the P2E space, he could have given his followers a more comprehensive picture of the games that he was encouraging them to invest in. This would have helped them make a more informed decision.Additionally, if Tan had the expertise to conduct some basic on-chain analyses on the projects that he was so enthusiastically pushing, he would have been able to caution his followers about the distributive behaviors that were taking place when they happened, so that they could have better protected themselves from what was coming next.Fathur Rahman, co-founder of SolanaFM, tells Tech in Asia that many influencers end up not properly educating their followers on the true risks involved when putting money into crypto investments. “That can be a dangerous thing, especially if the followers are younger and more gullible, he says.And yet a balance should be struck between being careful and excessive policing.“On one hand, one should hope that influencers are well educated and experts in the matters they expound on. But on the other, setting too high a bar replicates the same gatekeeping effects that are antithetical to the openness and transparency commonly cited as tenets to the industry,” explains Gene Yan, director of Octava, a Singapore-based family office.As much as it is easy for influencers like Tan to brush off his followers’ losses or ruin as something of their own making, he should not have put them in that position in the first place.SolanaFM’s Rahman says that an influencer should take responsibility for the content that they push out. “If they are beginners in a particular space, they should be open and honest about that and not try to craft a certain image of themselves to put themselves in a stronger position than they should be in,” he says.Rahman also thinks that influencers also need to be “honest and admit that they were wrong, like if they cause their followers to make the wrong trades and lose money, instead of always tweaking their image to show that they’re correct all the time.”Were Tan’s actions legal?Given the unprecedented and nascent nature of crypto and P2E games, it might seem like regulations do not apply. But that isn’t necessarily the case.“While every jurisdiction is different, it’s almost guaranteed that there are laws against running or abetting pump-and-dump schemes wherever you are,” Yan of Octava says.Legal experts believe that there is a case for the law to step in when it comes to cases like Tan’s.“There is a basic and logical principle that laws which apply offline should, in the absence of special justifications, apply equally online. In the real world, if one carelessly or recklessly advises another to make disastrous investments, one could be liable to compensate them for any resultant loss under our system of tort law,” Jerrold Soh, deputy director of the Singapore Management University (SMU) Center for Computational Law, tells Tech in Asia.This is particularly true “if one is a financial advisor of some sort,” he adds.Informal investment advice, such as from friends and family, typically carry less liability. But that’s not the case for crypto influencers, who are typically far more influential.“I can certainly see some of the bigger personalities gaining this aura of trust, and further for some of them to abuse – or at least mishandle – that trust,” he says.Erring influencers should be held responsible for their mistakes,” Soh stresses. “They should be liable for investment losses their followers incur, split roughly in the proportion of how careless both sides have been.” This is in line with the legal principle of contributory negligence, which serves to deter reckless behavior from both the influencer and victim.Vincent Ooi, a lecturer of law at SMU and the deputy head of tax at Zico Law, concurs with Soh.He further cites the recent guidelines from central bank MAS that restrict marketing and advertising from crypto service providers in Singapore.“While these guidelines may not bind crypto influencers per se, it does mean that any potential tie-ups with digital payment token providers should pretty much be out of the question,” Ooi says.Crypto influencers, he explains, may run into two types of risks: regulatory and private law.On the regulatory side, influencers should watch out for the Financial Services and Markets Bill, which has expanded on what counts as “digital token services” that fall under the purview of MAS. These services include those that provide investment advice or analyses or induce people to buy tokens.On the private side, influencers could be liable for breach of contract if they provide crypto trading advice for a fee and do so negligently.Generally, the legal risks are higher if they have accepted something in return for their advice. However, a person who gives “free advice” can still be found liable, says Soh.In short, crypto influencers cannot simply say whatever they want without due care. Let’s hope that Tan and anyone looking to follow in his footsteps are taking heed.","Ryan Tan, an influencer who runs a social media channel called Crypto King, shilled digital coins to his followers.

Through this initiative, we’re shining the spotlight on the women who are breaking barriers and achieving success in Asia’s tech and startup ecosystem.The value of having women in leadership positions is well documented. Businesses with women at the helm, for example, are more profitable and open to transformation and change. They also have greater diversity among their teams, which in turn is correlated with greater innovation – something that’s essential to Southeast Asia’s rapidly evolving digital economy.As we mark International Women’s Day this year, Tech in Asia has created a list of women who run the show at the region’s 30 top-funded companies. While we realize that funding may not be the best or only indicator of success, it’s certainly a helpful metric.To identify these leaders, we leveraged the Tech in Asia database and culled information from LinkedIn as well as company websites and organizational charts. We chose to limit the list to founders and C-suite executives of these organizations.We hope that this list will be an inspiration and a celebration of the many female leaders in our midst who are building vital, thriving businesses in Southeast Asia.﻿Spotted an error in this list?

735144,2022-03-07T02:00:10,2022-03-07T00:32:21,Here are 100+ Women in Power in Southeast Asia’s tech and startup community,100-women-power-southeast-asias-tech-startup-community,post,"In honor of International Women’s Day, Tech in Asia will be running content all week that celebrates and highlights some of the leading women in Southeast Asia’s tech and startup community. To kick things off, here is a list of 100 amazing women in the space, including founders, startup executives, and investors.I’m starting this Women in Power List because women remain underrepresented in the tech community. Far too many founding teams, C-suite lineups, and events are still wildly imbalanced. Last year, women-only founding teams received just 2% of total funding, the lowest percentage since 2016, even as venture capital funding hit all-time highs. Yes, we can and should talk about change. But it’s 2022 – let’s go a bit further with action and representation.Representation affects perception, and perception shapes our reality. Representation matters.Collectively, we must eliminate the excuse of “I couldn’t think of any women for my team/event/board.” While we are a long way from achieving parity for women in tech, we should realize that there are many, many incredible women in our community already.So the next time a leadership opportunity comes up, if you can’t think of highly qualified, capable women, use this list. Don’t let the excuse of not knowing enough women stop you from creating better representation in the ecosystem.Some disclaimers: This list is neither comprehensive nor ranked. There are so many more fantastic women in Southeast Asia’s startup and tech community. And ranking is super subjective and I don’t believe in such nonsense. Finally, this list is my own, not that of Tech in Asia.I will be updating this list monthly, as this is just a starting point. If you’d like to submit a name, please do so via this form.The need for a listI frequently find myself sourcing speakers for Tech in Asia’s various initiatives and events. While I’ve set the expectation for the team and myself to achieve gender parity in all our initiatives, we frequently fall short of our goal.Why?Awareness. There are simply far more men in the tech and startup scene than women. For any given opportunity, once various prerequisites are applied, it’s not uncommon to end up with a list of men without thinking.Conversion. In absolute numbers, if not proportionally, there are many qualified women in our community. But with so many demands on their time, women must be more deliberate in picking their opportunities. As a result, representation can fall short.Most recently for TIA School, I had to find eight founders to serve as guest lecturers for our course. By the numbers:20 total invites11 men, 9 women were invited6 out of 11 men agreed to lecture (~55%)2 out of 9 women agreed to lecture (~22% acceptance)Final result: 2 out of 8 lecturers are women, only 25% of the total groupI had a problem at both the top and the bottom of the funnel. I didn’t invite enough women in the first place and I also didn’t account for a lower conversion rate. My intentions were not enough. I needed to design parity into the process.The final line-up of lecturers for TIA School.Structurally, two small interventions would have gone a long way.First, make sure to invite at least the same number of women as men, if not more, at the outset. It can be hard to think of all the qualified women at the drop of a hat, so start with this list or any other list!Second, present great opportunities and persist in your offers. Because there are fewer women in the tech and startup scene overall, each female leader shoulders a heavier representation burden and has to be more selective in what she takes on. So don’t use a woman moderator as a band-aid for your “manel” – give her roles of substance and explain why she’s the best and most qualified person for that role. Make it worth her time.Obviously, this issue is a complex one, and my speaker example has relatively low stakes. But it snowballs.Fewer women being offered speaking opportunities means less of a platform for those women to be seen as leaders and leverage those opportunities for advancement. It means fewer female founders being seen as successful and potentially affecting their fundraising prospects. Fewer women in leadership roles means less role models for younger women. The problem stacks up, and even more so when we start talking about who to hire for the next fund, add to a board, or join a rocketship startup.Break the BiasThis year’s International Women’s Day theme is Break the Bias. Biases are dangerous because they are rarely rooted in fact or logic and are based on emotion and anecdotes. Breaking those biases can be tough because it is an amorphous, shifting enemy.One way to break the bias is to unearth, call out, and examine those biases when they are spotted. Another way is to design structures and processes to prevent biases from continuing.The Women in Power List is my attempt to break the bias that there are not enough women leaders in our tech and startup community.That’s simply not true.There are many amazing female leaders already. Let’s keep highlighting and celebrating them as we work to raise more women into leadership ranks.This week, Tech in Asia is tackling gender-based biases from different angles through think pieces, profiles, events, and surveys. Some highlights include a closed-door lunch with Love Bonito CEO Dione Song and Carsome CFO Juliet Zhu discussing how to bring more women into positions of leadership. We also had a conversation with two forward-thinking female leaders – Ayesha Khanna from Addo AI and Godelieve van Dooren of Mercer – about structural changes to address leadership and pay gaps. Plus, we’re releasing a qualitative survey that gives an intimate look at what it’s like being a female founder in their own words.Finally, to really widen the top of the funnel for women in tech, we’re making a donation to Generation Girl, a non-profit organization in Indonesia that creates programs to educate and train young women in STEM disciplines.International Women’s Day is just one day, and our content campaign is just one week, but the processes that we develop to contain biases can go a long way.So my question back to the community is: What structures can you design to break biases?Thanks to our sponsors Grab, Globalization Partners, and Infobip for helping us make this year’s International Women’s Day campaign and our donation to Generation Girl possible.","In honor of International Women’s Day, we’re celebrating the leading women in SEA’s tech and startup scene, and we’re starting off with this list.",257305,Maria Li,True,Jaclyn Tiu,0,"['Announcements', 'Opinion']","[""International Women's Day"", 'iwd2022', 'women in tech', 'women leaders']",False,,True,False,False,False,5

Get the newsletter in your inbox everyday with a Premium subscription.Hi readers,People come and go, and that’s especially true with companies and their employees. But behind every ebb and flow of talent leaving a company and joining another is a personal story that rings a truth that we all know but may choose to downplay: People matter and losing them is costly.I’ve been in the workforce for more than a decade, and I’ve had my share of doing all sorts of jobs. Journalism wasn’t my first gig and when I managed to cut my teeth in the trade, I began right at the bottom as a junior writer.Every time there was a town hall, I’d hear my previous bosses pull that cliched bluster of “everyone is dispensable,” only to backpedal when key staff start leaving. Then the typical song and dance ensues: The boss will counter offer, with some taking what seems like a new deal while others choosing to sever ties and move on.That people are crucial to an organization can be gleaned from Capital A chief Tony Fernandes’ LinkedIn post where he took aim at “new digital unicorns” who had poached his staff last year. But he wasn’t the only one in the wilderness, as my colleague Putra Muskita would find out – MyTukar, the Malaysian arm of automotive marketplace Carro, also lost talent that year, too.Where did these employees go? Carsome – the rival of Carro and, to a certain extent, Capital A as well.Some of Capital A’s and MyTukar’s former employees have been climbing up the ranks in their respective companies for over five years. What made them jump ship, I wonder, given all those years of dedication?There were whispers of Carsome poaching them, but the company told us that no such attempts were made.Anyway, journalism requires me to stay factual, and the fact is Carsome is currently a magnet for top talent.— Emmanuel Samarathisa, journalist at Tech in AsiaTop stories this weekImage credit: Timmy Loen1️.

We break down the big and messy topics of Asia’s tech and startup community. Get the newsletter in your inbox everyday with a Premium subscription.Hello reader,I’ve always thought that the smartest tech businesses are the ones that play a foundational and enabling role in a sector. Be that platform which everything else has to be built on, and you become indispensable, right? Just think about platforms like Amazon Web Services or even Apple and all the apps and businesses that rely on them.But of course, that’s easier said than done. In today’s premium article, we dive into the story of Polygon and see if it has what it takes to be at the center of the next wave of foundational tech: Web3.Today we look at:How Polygon is leading the charge to put India on the global blockchain mapThe series B+ equity financing round of this startup churning out autonomous-driving trucks Other newsy highlights such as the fallout from Sea’s recent earnings report and Animoca suspending its services in RussiaPremium summaryDoes the future of Web3 lie in India?Image credit: Timmy LoenYou might have noticed by now that I occasionally semi-force a reference to basketball and the team I support – the Dallas Mavericks – into these newsletters.Well, I don’t even really have to try this time: Polygon came into the spotlight last May when it received an investment from American billionaire Mark Cuban, who’s also the owner of the Mavericks.I’ve actually been fairly critical of how Cuban’s been running the team these past few years, but I can’t argue much with his business acumen – Polygon may be onto something here.From the bottom: Polygon’s early days saw its founders struggle to raise funds. On many occasions, the company had only enough money to pay one or two months’ worth of salaries.A foundational enabler: The firm wants to be the Amazon Web Services for Web3. Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal believes that developers will pick Polygon over Ethereum for building decentralized apps, as the former is far more scalable.Home-ground advantage: India is ripe for investments and startups to flourish, and it also has the largest base of developers globally. The current explosion of Web3 projects is perfect for Polygon, which relies on the support of blockchain developers to succeed. In comparison with its rivals, the company is well-positioned to tap into what the country’s Web3 ecosystem has to offer.Read more: How Polygon puts India at the heart of the crypto worldStartup spotlightSelf-driving into US$188 millionImage credit: Timmy LoenHong Kong-based Inceptio Technology, a startup developing self-driving trucks, has raised US$188 million in a series B+ equity financing round led by Sequoia Capital China and Legend Capital.Autobots, roll out: Inceptio offers autonomous-driving tech for trucks and operates a nationwide transportation-as-a-service freight network. It works with players in the automotive industry by preloading its offerings and systems into mass-produced autonomous trucks.Taking it up a level: At the end of 2021, Inceptio said it was able to mass produce Level 3 autonomous-driving trucks. Level 3 means that a vehicle can fully take over all driving tasks, but drivers still need to pay constant attention to the road and keep their hands near their steering wheels.Eye on the prize: Julian Ma, the founder and CEO of Inceptio, said that the startup will keep its focus on full-stack independent development and center its tech around mass producing units.Quick bytes1️⃣ Democratizing Indonesian agricultureIndonesia-based Agriaku, an agritech startup, has raised US$6 million in a pre-series A round led by Go-Ventures, the VC arm of Gojek.The startup plans to use the fresh capital to hire new talent in areas such as operations, supply chain, product, and technology. It also aims to strengthen the market presence of its B2B marketplace in the country.2️⃣ In deep watersSea Group dropped its market value by US$10.4 billion after the company posted its quarterly results. The firm has so far trimmed US$127 billion in market value from its peak last November.The decline in market value comes after Sea cut its year-on-year booking guidance for its digital entertainment unit Garena for the first time. The company cited “unanticipated government actions” in India as one of the reasons for the decline in its digital entertainment unit forecast.3️⃣ No comrade hereHong Kong-based Animoca Brands, a blockchain gaming unicorn, has halted its services in Russia to comply with sanctions placed against the country over its invasion of Ukraine.The move is part of a wide-ranging retreat of firms from Russia amid broad international condemnation of President Vladimir Putin’s decision to wage war in Ukraine. Animoca’s move makes the company stand out among major crypto firms like Binance and Kraken, which have continued to serve Russian users.4️⃣ I think the feedback’s gotta be pretty goodIndia-based Enterpret, a customer feedback intelligence platform, has raised US$4.3 million in a seed round led by Kleiner Perkins.

The previous round enabled the company to launch in Thailand – its first market – five months later, where it is currently serving 10,000 merchants across more than 70 cities.The Zaapi team / Photo credit: ZaapiThough registered in Singapore, Zaapi says most of its resources is in Thailand, with its team operating remotely.The company says it will use the fresh capital to scale its product and tech team in the first half of the year before growing its commercial team in the second half of 2022. While the firm looks to gain a strong foothold in Thailand, the company says it may expand to a second market by the end of the year.“Other companies have the tendency to put numbers and growth ahead of the product considerations. We want to make sure we don’t make that mistake,” says Zaapi co-founder and CEO Wilfried Buiron in an exclusive conversation with Tech in Asia.Currently, Zaapi has a mobile app that enables merchants to create an online store and start selling within seconds. It also provides features such as inventory management, discount management, customer relationship management, and payment integrations.Moving forward, the company will also develop activation tools for small businesses to acquire customers and traffic. This will include social commerce features like live commerce and chat commerce.Ideal entry pointThe vision for Zaapi, Buiron says, is to eventually become a full-stack digital solution for small businesses across Southeast Asia.To achieve this end goal, picking the right starting point is key. And Buiron, who also owns a direct-to-consumer brand, is confident that he has chosen a strategic point of entry, both in the company’s sector as well as the geography it operates in.Observing the strategies for regional and global peers, Buiron says that there are broadly three approaches to accessing the MSME market. One is the B2B procurement model championed by the likes of Udaan (India) and Ula (Indonesia). Another is the bookkeeping model employed by Khatabook (India) and BukuWarung (Indonesia), while the third is the approach of Shopify or India’s Dukaan, which helps offline merchants sell their products online.Zaapi has chosen the same model as Dukaan, whose co-founder invested in Zaapi’s seed round. This decision, Buiron says, was largely spurred on by the advent of Covid-19, which has made the historically “challenging sell” of selling products online easier for small businesses in Southeast Asia.“It is a use case that is extremely timely and one that has proven itself across all markets in the world who are ahead of Southeast Asia when it comes to ecommerce,” he says.Buiron acknowledges that he is not the first in the region to tap into this opportunity. In Indonesia, for example, BukuWarung and fellow MSME online ledger startup BukuKas have rolled out their ecommerce enabler solutions, while in Vietnam, seed-stage startup SoBangHan has also launched a similar product.A BukuWarung user in Indonesia / Photo credit: East VenturesHowever, Zaapi’s laser focus on small businesses will hold it in good stead amid regional competition, Buiron says. The company intends to “go much deeper” than other players – many of them treating ecommerce enablement merely as a small part of their large suite of products.Additionally, Buiron believes Zaapi will also benefit from its decision to turn to Thailand as its launchpad. Many other startups have gone to Indonesia, the region’s largest market, to kick off their businesses.Thailand is not only Southeast Asia’s second-largest ecommerce market, but it is also a relatively wealthy country, which bodes well for Zaapi’s basket size and margins. It is also a market where competition is “scaled back,” with few challengers in the ecommerce enablement scene.“It should also be noted that Thailand was the first market for Lazada and Zilingo. So there is a history of ecommerce startups launching in Thailand and doing very well,” Buiron says.","The startup has chosen Thailand as its first market, but it wants to be a full-stack digital solution for MSMEs across Southeast Asia.",586001,Ardi Wirdana,True,Putra Muskita and Jaclyn Tiu ,1,"['Ecommerce', 'Investments', 'News', 'Premium Content', 'Startups']","['1982 ventures', 'ecommerce enabler', 'Flourish Ventures', 'Global Founders Capital', 'shopify', 'Zaapi']",False,,True,True,True,False,3

It could have a recording studio for podcasts or music. I’m also trying to get a film theater placed in the store,” says Settle, an IT professional based in Okinawa.Settle’s store is in the metaverse. After getting access to it this February, he regularly pops into alternate reality to walk into his shop or to take a stroll around it to admire the scenery.His shop has the distinction of being the very first store in the art quarter of the RFox Valt, a metaverse built by Vietnam-headquartered company RFox (formerly known as RedFox Labs).RFox’s gaming-inspired quarter in its metaverse / Photo courtesy: RFoxBrian Cu, co-founder of transportation firm Byahe and the former country president of Grab Philippines, says the metaverse company “has been under the radar.” Cu is an advisor for RFox, which was launched in 2018.One reason the metaverse firm has been out of the media spotlight, he says, is because it was launched right before the crypto boom.This is likely to change soon considering RFox is opening its immersive retail and entertainment-centric metaverse to the public sometime “in the middle of this year,” says its founder Ben Fairbank.RFox aims to tackle all forms of the metaverse by plugging in stand-alone “moving parts” into the Valt and having a focus on gaming, finance, and media, says Fairbank.Enter stage leftBy 2026, 25% of people will spend at least one hour a day in the metaverse for work, shopping, education, social, and/or entertainment purposes, says Gartner in a recent report.It’s no wonder companies want to cash in.So at a time when firms like Meta, The Sandbox, and Zepeto are building their metaverses, RFox has set itself apart by fitting the classic definition of a metaverse, says Fairbank.A metaverse has to be interoperable, immersive, and interconnected, he says. “I think of it as a big box with hooks, and anyone can plug any application, any blockchain, into the box. That’s how we’ve built RFox.”The company has a VR-first approach to the metaverse, which fits the original design of the concept. The non-VR version of the Valt will be rolled out by the third quarter of this year.But RFox has stiff competition in the space. For instance, Forever 21’s virtual store on Roblox has seen 200,000 users since its launch in December 2021. Roblox, which has minigames and digital hangouts in its virtual world, has 55 million active users every day.See more: The Grab and Gojek alumni network in Southeast AsiaMany companies are in the metaverse ecosystem, “but they are not at the center of it. RFox is,” says Cu, who knows Fairbank from his days at Grab.Plug and playValt, which will be launched soon, is a global metaverse. Fairbank says the plan is to create localized Valts next, starting with the Philippines later this year and then moving on to Vietnam and Indonesia.These worlds – either those that are open worldwide or the ones customized by geography – may look largely similar, but the main difference is that the food courts, clothing businesses, and billboard advertisements will be locally influenced.Including the RFox Valt, there are five parts of the RFox ecosystem. The most recently launched is its white-label platform, RFox NFTs, which helps businesses set up a presence in the metaverse and the Web 3 ecosystem.“I speak with at least 15 to 18 companies every week,” says Fairbank. “They’ve all been given a mandate for a Web3 or a metaverse strategy for the year, but most companies don’t know how to get involved in the space.”RFox also has a decentralized finance arm, RFox Finance, which offers staking and farming features to holders of its tokens.RFox Games, meanwhile, issues keys to other games (KOGS). These are collectible, playable, and tradeable NFTs (non-fungible tokens) that can act as in-game currency, unlock tournaments and skins, and double as tickets to special events. While RFox plans to collaborate with other gaming companies in the future, its own play-to-earn game, KOGs Slam, is already available in 175 countries in beta.Notably, RFox also launched a “play-to-eat” game in Myanmar together with food delivery firm Foodpanda after realizing that the Myanmar government wasn’t receptive to crypto products. The initiative rewards food vouchers to people for playing a game, and Fairbank says the firm is looking to launch it in the Philippines next.While the play-to-eat model is not a moneymaker, it does help with building a positive image for RFox, says the founder.A close up view of RFox’s gaming-inspired quarter / Photo courtesy: RFoxThe company also has RFox Media, which will eventually offer services like advertising and marketing.The unit will also have a streaming component that looks like YouTube, but the founder says RFox is “changing the way the content is distributed.” The company has tied up with “huge distribution media companies,” says Fairbank, and the streaming feature will operate on a create-to-earn model, where content creators can directly upload to RFox TV and have purchases governed by smart contracts.RFox Media was formed after the metaverse firm acquired MyMedia Digital, a digital marketing platform in Myanmar that has worked with companies like Samsung, Huawei, Nestle, Lenovo, Grab, Oppo, and Vivo.It’s easy to see why Fairbank talks so often about moving pieces that are waiting for the right time to click together – it seems to be the company’s go-to strategy. For instance, RFox has a tie-up with Lazada Philippines for cashback and rewards that will go live once the Valt is open.Lazada and RFox have partnered up for ecommerce livestreaming, where Lazada will offer 8% to RFox for every purchase through the livestream content. RFox will give 7% to the buyer in the form of the company’s token currency and keep 1% as a referral fee. This fee can also be passed on to the customer if they bring in another user.The metaverse firm’s goal is to launch the first-ever ecommerce livestreaming cashback app on the blockchain.Whole is greater than the sumThe Valt aims to attract traffic. By doing so, businesses that set up shop in its virtual world won’t need to worry about building an audience from scratch, says Fairbank.These companies can also expand into countries without worrying about regulations. In some cases, like the Philippines, a foreign business can’t invest in certain sectors such as mass media, where at least 60% of the business has to be held by a Filipino citizen. But virtual real estate solves that if a company has a supply chain partner on the ground in the Philippines.The Valt itself has four quarters, and auctions for two of these areas – the art-focused quarter Callinova and gaming district Arkamoto – are already over.Shop auctions in the Callinova quarter brought in a total of 29.5 million rfox(the transactional currency for in-Valt purchases) or about US$1.3 million. The gaming quarter auctions brought in a total of 291 ETH (about US$1.2 million) in December.The company’s second token is VFox, a rewards currency that earns holders a percentage of all Valt transactions.Currently, the Valt’s marquee clients include cryptocurrency data aggregator CoinGecko, aggregator chain Icon, and gaming guild Yield Guild Games.The company has also collaborated with Reebok and Miss Universe Philippines for their NFT projects.The long gameByahe’s Cu agrees that RFox’s plans are ambitious to say the least. For one, the company has to vie for attention against a multitude of metaverse contenders. Virtual reality might also take a while to go mainstream (if it does), especially in countries with poor internet connectivity.“But if I trust someone to get it done, it’d be Ben,” Cu says.For now, though, RFox isn’t looking for VC funding. Fairbank has his reasons to hold off, as RFox has a runway for a few years. “People say it’s madness, but we’ve bootstrapped from the beginning,” says Fairbank, who adds that RFox gets offered VC funding “all the time.”RFox founder Ben Fairbank / Photo courtesy: RFoxBesides, investors would want the company to follow a playbook that others in the market are already sticking to.“Most of the VCs that we talked to say, ‘Why don’t you just do games and concentrate on one thing and become really good at it?’ They don’t understand the opportunity of building a platform for Web3,” says Fairbank.And now that Meta has announced its plans, Fairbank says there’s a race to see which is the first metaverse company to go public. But an IPO doesn’t have the same appeal it once used to, he adds.See also: Are SEA’s tech VCs missing out on the crypto craze?Instead, Fairbank says the company is looking for people who can bring value to the company regarding networking or partnerships. “We have no debt, we own 100% of the equity,” says Fairbank, adding that this makes RFox a good acquisition target.Meanwhile, as companies dream about the possibilities of virtual worlds, metaverse store owner Settle says his family looks at him like he’s “crazy” for having paid the equivalent of US$122,000 to buy a virtual shop. Still, “It’s going to be well worth it,” he says.",Vietnam’s RFox isn’t just building virtual shopping malls.

This was mainly due to a downturn in its mobility and enterprise and new initiatives segments.The company attributed this to higher consumer incentives for mobility and deliveries, as it invested in its category share and monthly transacting users (MTU) growth. While Grab’s consumer incentives soared by 126% to US$365 million in Q4 2021, partner incentives climbed 74% to US$218 million during the same quarter from a year earlier.Grab’s revenue is gross billings, which grew quarter-on-quarter, less driver and merchant incentives.Grab officially listed on Nasdaq in December 2021. / Photo credit: GrabIn Q4 2021, revenue from Grab’s mobility business shrank by about 27% to US$105 million, as the company invested more in driver incentives.

We break down the big and messy topics of Asia’s tech and startup community. Get the newsletter in your inbox everyday with a Premium subscription.Hello reader,When I was younger, I religiously watched Dragon Ball Z, the Japanese anime. There’s one thing about the show that I like to think of whenever I come across a merger of companies: It’s called “fusion” and it literally refers to two characters merging their bodies to defeat a more powerful enemy. The message was clear even to a young boy: The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.That also applies to two Indonesia-based startups that recently merged to create Quipster. In today’s story, we take a look at how this merger came about and what it means for the two firms.Today we look at:What a merger holds for Indonesia-based Webtrace and TraktorHub What a Shopify-like Vietnamese startup plans to do with its new capital Other newsy highlights such as AirAsia’s new financial marketplace in Indonesia and a US$200 million investment in Indonesian e-wallet Dana. Premium summaryFinding friendsImage credit: Timmy LoenWebtrace and TraktorHub have merged to form a new entity, Quipster. The move is not surprising one as the synergy between both firms is apparent: Webtrace provides an IoT solution to help companies monitor their vehicle assets, while TraktorHub’s platform helps companies rent or buy heavy equipment.Sorting out who’s who:  While both companies now operate under the Quipster banner, they will both continue serving their respective customers with Quipster acting as a holding entity. Webtrace’s co-founders, Erwin Subroto and Denny Tijioe, will serve as CEO and CFO of Quipster, respectively, while TraktorHub’s co-founder David Hartono will be COO of the merged entity.Mutual friends:  According to Subroto, the two companies first met via their common investor, Prasetia Dwidharma. What was initially meant to be a discussion for collaboration eventually snowballed once both firms realized that some of their founders knew each other. That was when they decided to pull the trigger and turn a partnership into a strategic merger.Fuel in the tank: Following the merger, Quipster intends to raise a pre-series A round later this year. Using those funds, the company plans to further its expansion to 12 cities in Indonesia. It’s also looking to build new products and forge partnerships with financial firms to offer loans or insurance services.Read more: Exclusive: Two heavy equipment startups backed by Indonesian super angel mergeStartup spotlightA new chapterA SoBanHang merchant / Photo credit: SoBanHangAlthough SoBanHang means “sales book” in Vietnamese, its founder, Bui Hai Nam, is looking to turn it into more than just a bookkeeping app. Fortunately, he’s off to a good start as SoBanHang recently raised US$2.5 million in funding, taking its total funds raised to US$4 million.Under the microscope: There’s a wave of startups in Vietnam that want to digitalize small businesses and retailers, but SoBanHang has an even sharper focus: the “nano and micro segment,” which includes household businesses or solo sellers that cannot afford to invest in point-of-sale software and other online infrastructure.Small businesses, big troubles: One of the key issues faced by these small businesses – which Nam estimates to number around 16 million in Vietnam – is that many of them have trouble taking their businesses online. According to Nam, this got even worse with the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.Filling the gap: With SoBanHang’s app, retailers can build an online store, create promotions, manage inventory, and track in-store sales and information about loyal customers. The best part? It’s currently free, although the firm plans to introduce a subscription model soon.Quick bytes1️⃣ Indonesia has lift-off on AirAsia MoneyMalaysia-based AirAsia has launched a financial product marketplace, AirAsia Money, in Indonesia. The marketplace aggregates financial products such as insurance, investments, money transfers, and donation support. As part of its launch, AirAsia partnered with local insurance startup PasarPolis, investment app Bareksa, donation platform Rumah Zakat, and payment service Wise.2️⃣ Confidence boostLanguage Confidence, an Australia-based AI firm, has raised US$1.5 million in a seed funding round, taking its total funding raised to date to over US$1.9 million. Founded in 2018, the firm offers an API that can automatically assess and correct students’ English pronunciation. It plans to use the fresh funds to expand its product offering and grow its customer base.3️⃣ Shots firedFor the first time ever, Sea Group has reduced its year-on-year booking guidance for its digital entertainment unit, Garena. It cited “unanticipated government actions” in India for the move, referring to the country’s recent banning of the gaming firm’s Free Fire title. Following this, Sea now expects bookings for Garena this year to be between US$2.9 billion and US$3.1 billion, compared with the estimated range of US$4.3 billion and US$4.5 billion in 2021.4️⃣ On cloud 9Chinese search engine Baidu saw a 9% uptick in its quarterly revenue, largely due to strong growth in its AI cloud business. This brings the company’s total revenue to US$5.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021, up from US$4.8 billion a year ago. Its core businesses, which include its search engine and AI cloud services, made up US$4.1 billion of the total figure, which marks a 12% increase year-on-year.5️⃣ A Dana dealDSST Dana Gemilang, a subsidiary of Indonesian conglomerate Sinar Mas Group, is set to invest US$200 million into Indonesian e-wallet Dana. The move will make DSST one of the largest shareholders of Dana, which is already one of the largest e-wallets in the country by monthly active users.

735622,2022-03-03T08:43:29,2022-03-04T01:54:05,"Sea’s new results disappoint, but offer tantalizing morsels",seas-results-disappoint-offer-tantalizing-morsels,post,"Sea’s fourth quarter and full year 2021 results were released on Tuesday, and three key things stood out.But first, it’s important to understand the backdrop. Much has transpired since November 2021, when Sea last announced Q3 results.Back then, its share price was a lofty US$330. But it had plummeted to US$145 a day before Q4 numbers came out.Image credit: Tech in AsiaTo be fair, many other tech companies – especially unprofitable ones – have been caught in the same maelstrom, which started when Jerome Powell, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, pivoted to a more hawkish position on inflation, raising the prospect of faster than expected interest rate hikes.However, company-specific factors were also at play for Sea.Free Fire, the flagship game of Sea’s digital entertainment unit Garena, was banned in India over national security concerns tied to Chinese apps, even though it is produced by a Singapore company. This cut the game’s access to a large market with massive potential for growth.Some analysts have also pointed out other issues, such as the impact of Garena’s slowing growth on Sea’s wider prospects and the long-term sustainability of ecommerce unit Shopee’s business model.Stormy seas for GarenaIndeed, Garena’s Q4 results were not pretty.Bookings, an operational metric that Sea uses to approximate cash spent by its users, came in at US$1.1 billion. This was not merely a case of lagging growth – it’s a decline from US$1.2 billion in Q3.Quarterly active users (QAU) and quarterly paying users (QPU) also fell from the previous quarter by 10% and 17%, respectively.Significantly, this is the first time since Sea’s IPO in 2017 that QAU has declined, and the first for bookings and QPU since the second quarter of 2018.The near-term outlook isn’t any rosier.Sea expects bookings of US$3 billion in 2022. This figure is around what the company achieved in 2020 and a third less than what it generated in 2021.The company attributes this setback to a slowdown in online activities as economies reopen amid the easing of the pandemic, and the ban on Free Fire in India.Given that Garena has been serving as a cash cow to fund Sea’s other businesses, investors are rightly concerned about the impact of any slump there. They didn’t react well to the results and guidance, sending Sea’s shares plunging 13% by the close of trading.While Sea said it was “working on multiple prototype games across different genres and stages,” these will take some time to monetize, and there is no guarantee that its initiatives will succeed.Of course, the business is still profitable – adjusted EBITDA for the year was US$2.8 billion. The Singapore government has also reached out to its Indian counterpart regarding the ban, raising the fact that Sea Group is Singaporean. A resolution of this issue in Garena’s favor would certainly ease the headwinds it faces.Shopee’s new deadline for profitabilityForrest Li, Sea’s chairman and group CEO, was undoubtedly aware of investor concerns over profitability, especially as Shopee incurs rising costs from its expansion into new markets like Latin America and Europe.Li kicked off the earnings call by emphasizing Sea’s plan to achieve “sustainable growth.” He also shared that Shopee was expected to reach positive adjusted EBITDA (before the allocation of headquarter costs) in Southeast Asia and Taiwan by this year.Numbers were provided to support this: Shopee’s EBITDA loss per order for these markets was 15 cents in Q4 2021 compared to 42 cents for the wider business. This is also an improvement from a loss of 21 cents a year earlier.Similarly, Li said that SeaMoney was expected to achieve positive cash flow by 2023.The message was clear. Shopee and SeaMoney’s core markets provide a strong foundation that can support further expansion, with the ability to “self-fund their own long-term growth” by 2025.Jittery investors should welcome clarity on Sea’s path to profitability as it gives them a timeline to hold management to. Assuming these projections hold, they will be a riposte to those who doubt the long-term sustainability of an ecommerce business in Southeast Asia.Brazil a “new growth market”While some investors want to see a path to profitability, many still demand robust revenue growth, which requires investment and may reduce short-term profit.Sea had something to entice them, too.The company has traditionally been rather cagey about its Brazil business, declining to go into specifics and emphasizing that things were at a “very early stage” when asked about it.See also: Brazil could become Shopee’s biggest market, beating even IndonesiaHowever, as 2021 progressed, Brazil was brought up more often. Li talked about it only once in the earnings call for Q1 2021, twice in the second, and five times in the third.The country merited 13 mentions on Tuesday, in enthusiastic language.Li described Brazil as Sea’s “new growth market,”adding how the company is “very excited about its growth prospects.”In fact, Shopee’s Latin America business – particularly Brazil – was highlighted as one of the company’s “top two focus areas for investment,”along with research and development.Li tantalized investors by sharing more numbers. In Q4, Shopee Brazil recorded over 140 million gross orders – up 400% year on year – and enjoyed more than US$70 million in revenue.In terms of gross orders, Shopee’s Brazil business is around the same size as Shopee was in Indonesia in Q3 2019. Brazil has a population of 200 million, the sixth largest in the world, so it could certainly provide Shopee with room for further growth in the years ahead.Its app is performing well in Latin America and India, in terms of active users and app downloads.However, the picture in Europe is mixed. Shopee has yet to enter the top 10 by active users rankings in any of the three European markets. But it was the most-downloaded app in Spain and Poland, which may generate more active users going forward.The same cannot be said for France, though. Perhaps this was one of the factors behind Shopee’s decision to shut its operations there.Sea has often touted its “disciplined and open-minded” approach when deciding where to invest. Ending its French operations suggests that the company is not sentimental about underperforming businesses, and investors should welcome this attitude.","Sea’s fourth quarter 2021 results suggest choppy waters for Garena, a path to profitability for Shopee, and a new growth story in Latin America.",246160,Simon Huang,True,Edited by Terence Lee and Eileen C.

Delivered every Thursday via email and through the Tech in Asia website, this free newsletter breaks down the biggest stories and trends in ecommerce. If you’re not a subscriber, get access by registering here.Hi there,In the last year till September 2021, Lazada was clocking in US$21 billion in gross merchandise value (GMV). The Southeast Asian giant, which started out as an Amazon clone in 2012, has played a significant role in the evolution of the region’s ecommerce scene.Lazada has been through many changes, including a revolving door of CEOs, as my colleague Tay Tian Wen summarizes in our Big Story this week.Our story also delves into the relationship between Lazada and its parent firm Alibaba. For instance, several senior Lazada executives held top positions at the Chinese tech titan.While I recommend that you view the visual story on a screen larger than your phone, our Hot Take for this edition is mobile-friendly in more ways than one. It’s about TikTok and its ecommerce ambitions, after all.— NikitaTHE BIG STORYOrg Chart: The people steering LazadaImage credit: Timmy LoenWe look at the crew leading Lazada Group as the firm celebrates its 10th year this month.THE HOT TAKEByteDance’s ecommerce playHere’s what happened:TikTok Shop, the ecommerce arm of TikTok, has launched in Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia.It was introduced in Indonesia and the UK last year.TikTok’s ecommerce GMV reached US$951 million in 2021.Here’s our take:Last week, The Checkout analyzed why ByteDance shut down its Shein clone, Dmonstudio. There’s been major developments on ByteDance’s ecommerce side since then.For one, TikTok Shop, which allows creators and brands to sell products directly to consumers through the app, is rapidly expanding across Southeast Asia and has ramped up hiring in Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia.In 2021, TikTok’s ecommerce GMV totaled 6 billion yuan (US$951 million), which is only about 1% of China-only counterpart Douyin’s GMV for the year.But for 2022, TikTok is looking at nearly 12 billion yuan from its ecommerce unit. It has reasons to be optimistic – the year it was established in China, Douyin’s ecommerce arm saw a GMV of about 500 billion yuan.Indonesia accounted for at least 70% of TikTok’s ecommerce GMV. The rest came from the UK, where TikTok Shop has been available since April 2021.While Douyin and TikTok’s parent ByteDance keeps its fingers crossed, it knows that livestreaming and social commerce play up to its strengths.In 2021, over 1.4 million social media conversations around livestream shopping took place in Southeast Asia, about 2x more than the same time a year before, according to a report from Meltwater. The media monitoring platform also found that Sea Group’s Shopee posted a 2.5x increase in annual livestream viewership on its platform.Shopee Celebrity Club livestreaming in action / Photo credit: ShopeeByteDance has been paying close attention to these trends. Last year, Douyin held a series of offline events in China to attract merchants, with executives describing the app’s 600 million daily active users as “very sticky.” The push also coincided with the rollout of payment service Douyin Pay.The timing is crucial: ByteDance’s ecommerce play comes as China’s government continues to keep a close watch on tech companies for a variety of reasons, including monopolistic behavior. This makes room for others to grow.Getting into ecommerce also means that TikTok’s parent company considers itself a strong challenger to Chinese giants like Pinduoduo, JD.com, and Alibaba. Others feel that the tide might be turning as well.Following Alibaba’s recent results, an analyst told the Financial Times that “the hit from Douyin and Kuaishou livestreaming ecommerce has been huge … Taobao livestreaming can’t compete.” Kuaishou is a Douyin rival while Taobao is a C2C and B2C shopping marketplace operated by Alibaba.TikTok’s popularity has spilled over to its ecommerce business and it shows. #TikTokMadeMeBuyIt is so catchy that BuzzFeed came out with several articles dedicated to the hashtag.Once a Chinese phenomenon, livestreamed shopping has gone global and is fast becoming the modern-day version of teleshopping. So much so that Canadian TikToker Lisa Couture had to temporarily close her candy store to fulfill the hundreds of orders that flooded in after her video went viral.Analysts also think that it’s only a matter of time before Chinese sellers will have access to the wider world through TikTok, which is expected to be “friendlier” to them than Amazon has been.Besides algorithms and resources, there’s another element at work in the social commerce game: the human factor.The popularity of TikTok Shop also depends on its roster of livestreaming stars. China’s Li Jiaqi or Lipstick Brother, who sold US$2 billion in goods in a single day on Alibaba, is a good example of the competition that ByteDance faces.It’s possible that with the now-defunct Dmonstudio, ByteDance could have had some control over the quality of select merchandise. But that’s not possible with a livestreaming model where the company has less control over the merchants on its platform.Take ByteDance’s Fanno, for instance. Much like Shopee’s problems in India, the quality of products is reportedly a hit or miss on Fanno in Europe.ByteDance likely expects so much more from TikTok Shop than from Fanno. After all, TikTok already has a captive audience ripe for a livestreaming harvest.– NikitaNEWS YOU SHOULD KNOWCheck out Tech in Asia’s coverage of the ecommerce scene here.1️⃣ Sea Group’s market value fell by US$10.4 billion after the company posted its quarterly results.

735431,2022-03-03T05:00:00,2022-03-03T14:10:16,How Polygon puts India at the heart of the crypto world,polygon-puts-india-heart-crypto-world,post,"Polygon is an India-based company that enables the Ethereum blockchain to handle many more transactions than the latter was originally designed to. Polygon came into the spotlight last May when it received an investment from American billionaire Mark Cuban.Polygon cofounders (from left): Mihailo Bjelic, Jaynti Kanani, and Sandeep Nailwal / Photo credit: PolygonFormerly known as Matic, the Mumbai-based company is “destroying everybody else” in the crypto space, Cuban declared at a panel discussion a month after his investment.Cuban’s bullish bet on Polygon came months before interest around Web3 and blockchain peaked among the masses.Polygon has found itself ahead of the curve and leading the charge to put India on the global blockchain map.Last month, the firm raised US$450 million in a strategic raise led by Sequoia Capital India, with Softbank Vision Fund 2 participating. Its relatively long line of investors also included Cuban’s Shark Tank colleague, Kevin O’Leary.What makes Polygon so hotPolygon’s mission is clear: It wants to be the Amazon Web Services for Web3. Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal expects developers will pick Polygon over Ethereum for building decentralized apps (dApps) as the former is far more scalable.This advantage could turn Polygon into the biggest name in the crypto space after Bitcoin and Ethereum, Nailwal tells Tech in Asia.Polygon’s confidence rests in its layer 2 scaling solutions, which serve as an intermediary between Ethereum and dApp creators. It speeds up blockchain transactions by processing them on “side-chains,” taking pressure off the main blockchain.At the same time, Polygon’s solution allows developers to build user-friendly dApps while staying within the familiar Ethereum ecosystem.In doing so, the company is countering the slow speeds and high transaction costs that have plagued blockchain users over the years, even as it benefits from Ethereum being the first popular smart-contract blockchain.Polygon is a collection of technologies. “It calls itself an Ethereum scalability solutions aggregator. The idea is that developers can choose the solution that works for them, rather than being presented with a one-size-fits-all route,” Manan Shah, CEO and founder of cybersecurity firm Avalance Global Solutions, tells Tech in Asia.See also: Ex-Grab, Googlers’ GameFi firm looks to bring play-to-earn to the masses Polygon developers can prioritize higher speeds, more security, or low transaction costs. This means Polygon can be used across both decentralized finance (DeFi) and gaming, which have different requirements, according to Sagar Garg, a blockchain consultant and ex-Mobile Premier League product manager.Over the past year, Polygon has bagged quite a few big projects in Web3 from the likes of DeFi protocols Aave and Uniswap, metaverse platform Sandbox, and NFT marketplaces like OpenSea and Cuban’s Lazy.com.More than 7,000 dApps are currently being built on the Polygon blockchain, making it one of the largest dApps platforms in the world.The adoption of Polygon’s proof of stake protocol has also jumped exponentially, clocking nearly a billion transactions in 2021. Over 2.67 million monthly active users on Polygon generate about 3 million transactions per day – almost 2x the volume on Ethereum.That’s why Polygon’s native Matic token enjoys a market value of around US$11 billion.Photo credit: Polygon / AlchemyPolygon’s next big bet is zero-knowledge (ZK) roll-ups, which promise even faster transaction speeds than its optimistic rollups, which it currently uses.Under its Polygon Zero initiative, it has made a few big investments. In December 2021, it acquired Mir, a ZK tech startup, in a US$400 million deal.Polygon is also investing in projects at the intersection of social media and Web3 via a US$200 million initiative in partnership with Seven Seven Six, a VC firm owned by Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian.Ohanian said Seven Seven Six will look for opportunities in the gaming and social media spaces, leveraging Polygon’s scalable infrastructure. The VC holds a diverse portfolio of Web3 projects, including Sky Mavis, maker of the popular blockchain game Axie Infinity.Polygon also recently invested in Hike, an India-based social media firm that operates play-to-earn platform Rush Gaming Universe.Nailwal says these firms fit into Polygon’s 10-year roadmap. Some of them may bear fruit within 12 months while some of its other efforts may become prominent in the next three to five years, he added.Humble beginningsPolygon’s journey so far, however, has been an uphill battle.In 2015, Sandeep Nailwal was running a B2B marketplace. While there, he caught the crypto bug and realized that decentralized networks had uses beyond cryptocurrencies.Nailwal used his programming expertise to code a few dApps for clients. Following some success, he took it up as a full-time job.Around the time, Nailwal got in touch with Jaynti Kanani, who had quit his job as a data scientist at Housing.com. Nailwal also saw some of the proofs of concept of his projects and apps, based on a “plasma” framework that Kanani had developed. Nailwal and Kanani then decided to join hands to build Polygon, before onboarding Anurag Arjun, their third co-founder.The firm struggled to cope with an unexpected market slump in the initial months after its launch.It was all the more difficult as not many people believed a team from India could build pathbreaking infrastructure protocols, Nailwal tells Tech in Asia.Polygon’s early days also saw its founders struggling to raise funds.Nailwal adds that the company had to work hard to convince even small-scale investors to back it. The volatility in bitcoin prices also kept investors at bay.On many occasions, the company had only enough money in store to pay one or two months of salaries, Nailwal says. This forced him to make personal requests from investors to shell out some US$50,000 in emergency funding to keep the firm afloat for another five months.“You must have heard about Polygon, maybe five or six months ago, when we really exploded in the global space. But we had been grinding our way for the last three years. Nobody had then paid attention,” he adds.When some Polygon-based dApps became popular, the firm finally received recognition in India and abroad.Photo credit: PolygonPolygon’s exponential rise, however, may not go unchallenged. Ethereum itself may be a force to reckon with once it solves its scalability issues, though that may take a while. Vitalik Buterin, the inventor of Ethereum, has called layer 2 solutions the future of his creation’s efforts to reach scale.Then there are “Ethereum killers” like Avalanche, Fantom, Solana, and BNB Chain, which provide attractive alternatives to dApp developers.At the same time, Polygon’s growing size may mean it could chew more than it can swallow.Garg notes that Polygon and other networks are working hard to ramp up throughputs and scale, but it may still not be enough to handle heavy traffic. This was recently evident in the Sunflower Farmers game incident, which choked the Polygon network.The game was designed in a way that as more people joined the game, the supply of its tokens jumped up, and the rewards dropped, Garg said.This meant that someone playing the game in its early days would receive more rewards for harvesting a sunflower than late joiners, leading to a sort of race. This congested the Polygon network and raised its gas prices.See also: Are SEA’s tech VCs missing out on the crypto craze? Setting the stage for India’s Web3 boomPolygon could still give India a foothold in the crypto world. Already, there is increasing investor interest in India’s Web3 space – Sequoia Capital India made as many as 19 investments in Web3 startups in the second half of 2021.“The kind of innovation that we’re seeing in DeFi is extraordinary,” Rajan Anandan, managing director of Sequoia Capital said, said in December last year.“A key catalyst for Web3 that we’ll see this year will be the L2 (layer 2)/roll-up ecosystem coming online in a big way,” Sequoia India managing director Shailesh Lakhani tells Tech in Asia.Lakhani adds that the ecosystem will help reduce transaction costs substantially and open up Web3 to a number of new applications.Another top VC that is aggressively chasing Web3 is Antler.In December 2021, the VC announced that it would allocate one-third of its planned investment in India to blockchain and Web3 projects. It aims to fund up to 30 such early-stage projects in the country in the future. Antler will also expand its India team with blockchain and Web3 specialists to accelerate its investments in the sector.Nitin Sharma, global blockchain lead at Antler and partner at Antler India, tells Tech in Asia that Web3 and decentralization are among the top priorities for the VC right now.He believes that India is going to play a huge role in scaling up the Web3 space, given the depth of developer talent in the country.Sharma adds that Antler has created a one-stop common application for founders – especially those making a transition from Web2 to Web3 – allowing selected founders to be funded by various local Antler funds, be invited to co-founder matching programs, and be mentored by a special group of Web3 advisors, including several Web3 founders.Antler has also brought in Polygon, Solana, and Avalanche as ecosystem partners to help new Web3 founders navigate the complex landscape, he added.Photo credit: Sandeep NailwalApart from generating investor interest, a few Indian startups are also pushing the needle on what’s possible in the Web3 space.Anshul Rustaggi founded Totality Corp in 2019 as a playable Ethereum-based NFT play-to-earn game. The company plans to create collectible and playable NFTs based on Indian mythology. As of December 2021, it has raised US$1.8 million and plans to raise more this year.Chingari, a short-video app similar to TikTok, is another Indian startup grabbing headlines in the Web3 world. The platform is betting on a social token called $GARI, which can be used for multiple purposes such as for governance, tipping content creators, and buying items like NFTs from its marketplace.It went live on a dozen crypto exchanges in January. On its inaugural day, the $GARI token’s market value topped US$100 million.Besides having a ripe environment for investments and startups, India has another crucial advantage: It also has the largest base of developers globally and is witnessing an explosion in the number of Web3 projects. “India and Web3 offers a fertile ground where we will see a number of use cases that are brand new,” Sequoia’s Lakhani added.This would come as music to the ears of Polygon, which relies on the support of blockchain developers to succeed. In comparison with rivals, it’s well positioned to tap into what the country’s Web3 ecosystem has to offer.In the Web2 era, the likes of Zoho and Freshworks have shown how companies born in India can produce world-class products and services.But if Polygon delivers on its potential, it could do something that’s never been done before: Place India right at the heart of the next wave of foundational tech – a welcome prospect for a company that once struggled to get face time with investors.","Polygon is leading India’s Web3 revolution, but the road to the top was long and hard.",580372,Kul Bhushan,True,,0,"['Analysis', 'Blockchain', 'Premium Content', 'Profiles']","['blockchain', 'cryptocurrency', 'Ethereum scaling platform', 'Etherium', 'India', 'Jaynti Kanani', 'matic', 'polygon', 'Polygon Studios', 'Sandeep Nailwal', 'Sequoia Capital India']",False,,True,True,True,False,8

735304,2022-03-03T02:00:47,2022-03-02T07:43:16,Here’s how businesses can stay one step ahead of fraud,heres-businesses-stay-step-fraud,post,"Fraud is on the rise in Southeast Asia. In recent months, 790 customers of Singapore’s Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation were hit by an SMS phishing scam, resulting in the loss of over S$13.7 million (US$10.2 million).This incident is just one example of how fraud has evolved in recent years. And fraudsters aren’t just targeting customers – businesses are wrestling with the problem as well. According to Staying Ahead Of The Fight Against Fraud In Southeast Asia, a study commissioned by GrabDefence and conducted by Forrester Consulting, seven out of 10 surveyed businesses said they had experienced fraud in the last twelve months.Photo credit: fizkes / 123RFHowever, the truth is that these developments aren’t all that surprising. Fraud has been around for as long as there’s been money to be made, and fraudsters have always sought opportunities to make illegal gains.“It’s the nature of fraud, that it will never go away,” says Brian Kim, the head of business development and strategy at GrabDefence, Grab’s B2B enterprise fraud solution business.Drawing from GrabDefence’s experience of managing fraud for both Grab and third-party customers, Kim notes that fraudsters are constantly evolving, seeking out new ways to defraud businesses – and Southeast Asia has presented plenty of opportunities for fraud.State of fraud in Southeast AsiaKim points to the growth of digital services in Southeast Asia as a major driver of fraud in the region. The arrival of new services has led to new opportunities for fraudsters to take advantage of.For example, new methods of payment such as digital wallets may give fraudsters new avenues to take advantage of, while new services – like ride hailing – have created new ways for bad actors to defraud businesses.Southeast Asia’s competitive tech scene makes matters worse. Both new startups and incumbent organizations are trying to bring customers to their digital services, making signing up and transacting on their platforms as easy as possible. However, that creates problems as well.“You cannot afford to introduce friction into the customer experience when there’s such heavy competition for customer acquisition, but in doing so, you leave a lot of doors open for fraudsters,” says Kim.Brian Kim, the head of business development and strategy at GrabDefence / Photo credit: GrabDefenceAnd, of course, Covid-19 has exacerbated the situation as it resulted in a surge in internet users in Southeast Asia.“With Covid-19, many people are coming online for the first time,” Kim explains. “These are people who may have never used a digital platform in their lives, and are unaware of the threats that exist on online platforms, making them more susceptible to fraud.”The many faces of fraudThe three most common forms of fraud that businesses face in Southeast Asia are those related to online digital wallets, promotion abuse, and fake reviews and ratings, according to the GrabDefence and Forrester report.From Kim’s perspective, these types of fraud are the most common due to the competition among businesses in Southeast Asia.As firms work to acquire customers, they’re rolling out a variety of schemes to incentivize consumers to come on board, and looking to make the customer experience as smooth as possible, offering discount codes, sign-up bonuses, and a variety of different payment options. While this is good news for consumers overall, it inevitably creates plenty of opportunities for fraudsters to take advantage of.Photo credit: tashka2000 / 123RFFraud is also costly for businesses. Over 75% of the organizations surveyed in the report said each type of fraud had a moderate or significant financial impact on their organizations, and firms that experienced promotion abuse reported a loss of 31% on average in their annual marketing spend as a result.However, the total cost of fraud is significantly higher. Besides the financial cost, businesses also have to grapple with other issues such as heightened compliance requirements, damage to brand and reputation, and the impact on customer satisfaction and trust.“All of these go hand-in-hand – you’ll have unhappy customers ringing up your hotline, people will be distrustful of any emails you send or promotions you’re running,” says Kim. “You may need to rework your internal processes constantly, and your costs will definitely go up.”The challenges with fraud managementIt’s no surprise that fraud management is a top priority for many companies. Of the organizations surveyed in the report, 82% plan to either set up enterprise fraud management (EFM) solutions or upgrade their existing solutions.However, neither is easy to do. Businesses have highlighted the impact of implementing EFM solutions on customer experience as one of the top challenges they face – something Kim has also observed with GrabDefence’s customers.“Risk management often comes with increased friction for users, and businesses often struggle to maintain a balance between the two,” he says. “As you tighten your fraud prevention policy, you’re going to get less fraud. But at the same time, your cost is going to increase because your customer experience will deteriorate, and you might see more false positives.”After all, if a customer has to jump through many hoops and know-your-customer processes to create an account, or go through multiple forms of verification to make a simple purchase, they might just take their business elsewhere, leading to a loss for the company.Aside from balancing customer experience and fraud management, another key difficulty is adapting to the evolving methods of fraud.“Fraud is a continuous cat and mouse game,” Kim says. “Whenever you put a new fraud prevention measure in place, fraudsters find the loophole very quickly – they know how to leverage technology to bypass all these measures. Understanding this and future-proofing yourself, is another challenging element.”Keeping the fraudsters at bayTo that end, how can businesses ensure they’re putting the right fraud management solutions in place? Kim’s advice is to work with a provider that truly understands the problem at hand and can work with your company to provide a solution that balances customer experience and fraud prevention.“It’s not so much about stopping fraud per se, but about making sure you introduce the minimal level of friction into the system and striking that balance,” he says. “It’s important to make sure you work with a service provider that has that experience and know-how about how to identify and create this balance.”Additionally, firms need to have the right mindset to tackle fraud.“It’s not a one-off thing,” Kim says. “You don’t just say we’ve found the balance, we’ve implemented this, and that’s it. It’s something that continuously evolves, and the optimal level will change as new fraud types emerge.”As such, it’s important for companies to make sure their fraud solution partners can adapt to these changes and work to develop new solutions as needed. Ideally, these partners should leverage technologies such as AI and machine learning to stay ahead of the game and mitigate fraud before it happens.“What [businesses] need to do is to continually evolve and adapt to understand what’s happening and tackle the problems that arise,” he concludes.Built for the digital economy, GrabDefence helps businesses combat fraud while ensuring a frictionless experience for their users.Learn more about the state of fraud in Southeast Asia and how to balance fraud prevention and customer experience by downloading the report Staying Ahead Of The Fight Against Fraud In Southeast Asia, produced by GrabDefence and Forrester, here.This content was produced by Tech in Asia Studios, which connects brands with Asia’s tech community.

Who are the key decision-makers? How are the teams organized? What does it tell us about the company’s priorities? We continue this series with ecommerce major Lazada.When Lazada launched in Southeast Asia in 2012, it was well placed to seize the region’s ecommerce market. A decade later, the company nearly went public until parent firm Alibaba shelved talks earlier this year.Backed by German venture builder Rocket Internet and big-name investors like JPMorgan Chase, co-founders Maximillian Bittner, Mads Furholt, Stefan Bruun, and Rafael Stauch created Lazada. What started out as an Amazon clone would eventually come to define the early days of Southeast Asia’s ecommerce scene.See also: A closer look at the Lazada mafiaSince then, Lazada has been through many changes, including a revolving door of CEOs.In November 2018, Bittner was replaced as CEO by former Ant Financial fintech director Lucy Peng. But just nine months after assuming the role, Peng herself stepped down and handed over the reins to Lazada veteran Pierre Poignant in August 2019.Poignant left Lazada in June 2020, and Chun Li became the ecommerce major’s third CEO in three years. He was CTO at Alibaba’s B2B business unit between 2014 to 2017. Li is also Lazada Indonesia’s CEO, indicating the significance of the country’s ecommerce market.Li isn’t the only top executive to have ties to Alibaba. Lazada CFO Frank Luo, for example, was a finance director at the Chinese tech titan between 2017 to 2018. Andy Huang, Lazada’s chief logistics officer, had a three-year stint as vice president of supply chain and logistics at Cainiao, Alibaba’s logistics arm.Other Alibaba alumni at Lazada include Lilian Jiang, Howard Wang, and Raymond Yang, who serve as chief people officer, CTO, and COO respectively.Here are a few more observations:Each country has its own CEO except Thailand and Vietnam, which are both helmed by James Dong.Jessica Liu was president of Lazada Group and CEO of Lazada Thailand until her departure in May 2021. It’s unclear whether her role as group president has been filled since then.Magnus Ekbom, chief strategy officer and acting CEO at Lazada Malaysia, and Gerald Glauerdt, chief logistics officer at Redmart/Lazada Singapore, are the only executives left from the original Rocket Internet founding team.Lazada Wallet is operated by Alibaba’s Alipay division. Some executives that oversee Lazada Wallet are also Alipay employees.Richard Ruddy and Emily Eades joined Redmart after the Singapore-based online grocery store was acquired by Lazada in 2016.Tech in Asia invited Lazada to participate in this story, but the company declined.

We break down the big and messy topics of Asia’s tech and startup community. Get the newsletter in your inbox everyday with a Premium subscription.Hello reader,As startups go through their different stages of growth, founders are invariably posed with the question of how to not only retain but also develop their most prized talents.Financial incentives such as employee stock ownership plans, increased salaries, and better perks are one way of achieving this. However, it may not be the most sustainable strategy, given most startups are strapped for cash.Others may instead focus on strategies that don’t burn their pockets. One example is a program focused on putting “workers in the center” by prioritizing personalized learning, leadership experiences, and growth, which is being touted as a way to keep hold of talented employees.It appears that Sea Group has led the way on this front.For our premium story pick today, Tech in Asia spoke with several Sea Group alumni who waxed lyrical about its workplace culture. For instance, the word “hungry” comes up more than once to describe Sea employees’ desire to solve problems.Entrepreneur Keren Wang spoke glowingly about her holistic experience at Shopee, Sea’s ecommerce platform, while ShakeDeal co-founder Akash Hegde shared that he had a front-row seat to how a company could be scaled up, having worked at Shopee in its early days.Today we look at:Sea Group’s nascent, but booming alumni network The series A round of an Indian textile supply chain firmOther newsy highlights such as Nio eyeing HK, SG secondary listings, and MAS placing Capital Match on an investor alert listAlso, if you’re an entrepreneur looking for funding, fill out this form to get your company featured on our list of fundraising startups.Premium summaryBuilding on Sea’s successImage credit: Timmy LoenSea’s steady growth provides a handy reminder to its alumni network that they’re well-equipped to scale and build successful businesses. Perhaps that partly explains why it’s been a busy time for some of Sea Group’s alumni, who have launched new startups despite the Covid-19 pandemic.Not surprisingly, most of the startups founded by Sea’s alumni are in the ecommerce space. But many who were with Garena, Sea’s digital entertainment unit, have launched gaming-related ventures.Heavy hitters: While most startups coming out of Sea’s alumni network have received funding in the seed stage, some have made formidable strides. Jumei, a China-based online cosmetics company, made a US$430 million stock market debut in 2014. Bitkub, a Thailand-based cryptocurrency exchange, was acquired for US$536 million in November 2021.More are coming: What most alumni agree on is that there are going to be a lot more startups founded by the Sea mafia in the next couple of years. For Luke Ong, an ex-Shopee team member who is part of the founding team at Una Brands, he believes that more startups will emerge from the network in two to three years.Serial entrepreneur: Some Sea alumni have established multiple startups in Indonesia. After setting up Modal Rakyat, a working-capital enabler for startups and SMEs, in 2018, Wafa Taftazani launched two startups in 2021 – VCGamers and UpBanx.

He added that the company recorded a 50x revenue growth in the last 18 months.No knots here: One of Locofast’s key focus areas will be international expansion. While it already has customers from Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, it will set up an office in the US soon. The firm expects the expansion to contribute at least 20% to 25% of the total business in the next 12 months. It’s also mulling over entering Europe, especially its large markets.Weaving growth: Aside from expanding its domestic and overseas presence, Locofast will use the fresh capital to launch new product categories. The company also plans to increase its current headcount of 50 to as much as 500 over the next 12 months, and it aims to grow the number of suppliers on its platform to 2,500 in the same period.Quick bytes1️⃣ Introducing NioChinese electric vehicle major Nio is eyeing secondary listings by introduction in Hong Kong and Singapore as it looks to expand across the region.

Delivered every Wednesday via email and through the Tech in Asia website, this free newsletter breaks down the biggest stories and trends in fintech. If you’re not a subscriber, get access by registering here.Hello there,I don’t remember the last time I withdrew cash from an ATM – all my transactions are done via digital wallets these days.Since I live in one of India’s metropolitan cities, which are more mature markets for fintech, maybe it’s a privilege that I get to say this. That said, a closer look will show that the growth of digital transactions is now driven by Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities in the country.India’s fintech sector has become a crowded market, regularly tapping into billions of dollars from investors. But fintech adoption seems like a global phenomenon. Not too far away from India, Vietnam also has a burgeoning fintech space, which attracted over US$500 million in funding in 2021 alone.One player is Vietnam’s latest unicorn, MoMo. With a user base of 31 million, the fintech firm can pin its early success down to its mobile-only approach.But experts say that fintech companies cannot grow on digital wallet services alone, as the margins are too thin. That may be why MoMo is now trudging on a path toward its super-app dreams.In this week’s Big Story, my colleague Huong dives into MoMo’s super-app ambitions. Can the company reinvent itself to survive intense competition in Vietnam?Read on to know more.— SamreenTHE BIG STORYAnalyzing MoMo’s super-app ambitionsImage credit: Timmy LoenWe dissect the challenges for the Vietnamese unicorn as it plows ahead in the country’s fintech battleground.THE HOT TAKEGreen financing takes off in IndonesiaPhoto credit: AkulakuHere’s what happened:Indonesian fintech firm Akulaku is considering receiving US$100 million in green financingThe source of the funds is a Singapore-based entityFunding may be channeled to consumers wanting to purchase electric vehiclesHere’s our take:Akulaku, an Indonesian digital banking and finance unicorn, is considering receiving US$100 million in green bonds from a Singapore-based entity. This comes on the back of its recent US$100 million series E fundraising that saw its valuation rise to US$2 billion.Indonesia is no stranger to green financing: The country’s government has issued at least four green bonds since 2018, and the Asian Development Bank approved a US$150 million loan to support green infrastructure projects in the archipelago just last month.However, the private sector has been less active, especially compared to peers such as Thailand.If it pushes through, the deal with Akulaku will mark a turning point. As a private sector company that lends to consumers, Akulaku can link green financing directly to consumers’ wallets and their purchasing decisions.The impact this will have is uncertain. The Indonesian consumer is generally less aware of climate change than those in other countries. A survey conducted by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication found that only 32% of Indonesian respondents claimed to know either a lot or a moderate amount about climate change, the second-lowest of the 31 countries surveyed.Additionally, Indonesia is also among the top 10 countries that believe more information is needed about climate change to form a firm opinion.Companies like Akulaku that have a direct relationship with the consumer and can offer them financing, specifically for purchasing sustainable products and services, are well-positioned to educate consumers.Financing electric vehicle (EV) purchases is a good place to start. Indonesia is one of the markets with the highest potential for EV adoption in the world, according to McKinsey &amp; Company.But EVs are just the tip of the iceberg. Products ranging from mattresses to iPhone cases can have an eco-friendly angle.Of course, one of the thorny questions is who gets to decide what is green and what isn’t – will that responsibility lie with companies like Akulaku as well? Amid a growing chorus warning against “greenwashing” and as green financing increases its market share, these questions will become more important.US$100 million represents under 5% of the US$2.2 billion in credit that Akulaku disbursed in 2021. Yet, it would be a small step in the right direction to shape local attitudes and behavior toward climate change.— SimonNEWS YOU SHOULD KNOWCheck out Tech in Asia’s coverage of the fintech scene here.1️⃣ Tinder co-founder leads $29m round of SG fintech firm: The fresh funds will fuel Volopay’s foray into two regions: Asia Pacific and the Middle East and North Africa.2️⃣ Tencent-backed fintech firm nets $100m in series C money: Niyo said it has been adding more than 10,000 new users to its platform every day.3️⃣ Uzbek fintech startup nets $1m in seed funding: Iman’s Islamic finance operations have been certified as compliant with Sharia law.4️⃣ Singapore fintech firm M-Daq to buy cross-border payments startup: M-Daq aims to integrate Wallex Technologies with its foreign exchange solution Aladdin.That’s it for this edition – we hope you liked it!

734774,2022-03-02T02:00:49,2022-02-28T04:50:46,When good customers behave badly: The unknown side of online retail fraud,good-customers-behave-badly-unknown-side-online-retail-fraud,post,"Ecommerce was one of the earliest successes in Southeast Asia’s tech and startup scene, and if last year’s 11.11 sales results are any indication, it’s a train that’s not stopping any time soon. During the sales event, Shopee set new records for items sold and shopper visits, while Lazada saw new users in Thailand rise by 120% compared to 2020.One major driver of these mind-boggling numbers is the promotions and discounts that come out in full force during these major sales events. In the lead-up to the actual sale days, shoppers are encouraged to collect all manner of vouchers, and they also get access to benefits such as free returns or gifts with their purchases, among others.Unfortunately, despite these offers, some customers still look for loopholes to get extra benefits. This is also known as policy abuse, which is when customers exploit the benefits available to them.One example of this is promotions abuse. According to Monica Acree, general manager and vice president of sales at fraud prevention company Forter, retailers offer many incentives – such as giving customers 10% off their first purchase – to drive customer retention. “However, some shoppers will often open multiple accounts to take advantage of this discount, and as a result, the retailer ends up incentivizing existing customers unintentionally, which drives up the cost of acquisition,” she says.Differentiating between fraud and abuseThese cases of abuse don’t strike casual observers as particularly damaging to online retailers. It’s just smart shopping, right? While many think the real problem comes from card and identity fraudsters, the numbers tell a different story. Global studies show that fraud losses add up to around US$22 billion a year, while policy abuse losses are much greater, estimated at around US$65 billion annually, Acree says.Monica Acree, general manager and vice president of sales at Forter / Photo credit: ForterThese losses pile up from various sources like logistics fees, restocking costs, losses from damaged goods, and costs from inventory that can’t be resold. The overall operational burden of managing these processes also has a significant impact on the retailer’s bottom line.But let’s take a step back and explain the difference between fraudsters and abusers. “Fraudsters are generally bad actors participating in illegal behavior, such as stealing identities or payment instruments, and utilizing that for financial gain,” Acree explains. On the other hand, abusers, she says, are actual customers who take advantage of a retailer’s policies or promotions. “In layman’s terms, this is when good customers are doing bad things.”Besides promotions abuse, there are other ways that customers try to game the system. One example is an abuse of the returns system. In these cases, a culprit could buy an item such as skincare or perfume, empty the container, fill it with water or a cheaper product, then return it. In some instances, abusers will mark that they haven’t received an item and file for a refund even though the product was successfully delivered.A fine lineThe ways that fraud and abuse are combated also differ. Countermeasures are black and white when dealing with fraudsters – they are breaking the law and should be identified and reported to the authorities. When it comes to policy abusers, however, it’s much trickier, as risk tolerances and policies differ from retailer to retailer.“It looks different for every business, so it’s really hard to accurately measure in real time the losses or the cost to the organization,” Acree points out. “Additionally, because policy abusers are technically legitimate customers just doing bad things, you might not want to have a binary response to these abusers. You might want to have a more nuanced approach.”With returns abuse, for example, imposing a blanket “no free returns” policy on the whole customer base might solve the issue, but it also punishes good customers who have legitimate reasons for returning an item. It’s important to understand that abusers make up only a small segment of users, so retailers shouldn’t treat all customers the same.“You have to really look behind the transaction and at the identity of that user to understand the potential risk associated with each customer and offer tailored policies,” Acree says. “And that’s a challenge because a lot of retailers don’t have those tools in place to do that.”A network of protectionForter, the fraud prevention company Acree works for, helps online retailers with this very issue with its Trusted Policies solutions, which utilize machine learning and AI to pinpoint the identity behind online interactions. This enables retailers to make informed decisions and even tailor policies for each individual. For example, an identity known to be a repeat abuser of returns policies can have their next purchase marked as a “final sale.”“Our solution is not a rules-based solution,” Acree explains, adding that the company has visibility on over a billion individual identities globally. “Often with fraud or abuse prevention, retailers will set rules which cast wide nets. Anybody that passes the rule gets approved; anybody that does not pass gets declined. And that causes a lot of what we call false positives, where good customers are being declined.”Photo credit: antonioguillem / 123RFAdditionally, the company works with a large network of retailers, processing over US$250 billion worth of transactions on an annual basis. When a case of abuse occurs on one platform, Forter not only helps solve the issue for that retailer, it also proactively puts in place measures to prevent that identity from abusing the policies of its other clients.“We have a large network of identities that we can leverage from one retailer to another,” Acree says. “That network impact is one critical thing that we can offer retailers beyond their own abuse prevention policies.”More shopping days, more problemsAs ecommerce continues to grow, so too will customer expectations. Retailers have to keep pace with better promotions and flexible policies. The continued success and proliferation of major sale days means more opportunities over the course of each year for policy abuse to occur.The markedly increased traffic that these campaigns bring in also means that hiring people to manually review transactions is not a scalable option and that automation is a necessity.To stay competitive, Acree says, it’s important for retailers to be able to offer these flexible policies.“They just have to identify that small segment taking advantage – and that’s going to always try to take advantage – so they can be addressed while preserving the most positive experience for all their other customers,” she concludes.Find out more about policy abuse and how to prevent it by reading Good customers gone bad: Beyond eCommerce fraud, Forter’s report on the subject.This content was produced by Tech in Asia Studios, which connects brands with Asia’s tech community.

The new locationsignifies its status as Vietnam’s latest tech unicorn after a recent US$200 million series E roundled by Japan’s Mizuho Bank.Now valued at US$2.2 billion, MoMo – which is short for “mobile money” – was founded in 2010 by a group of Vietnamese entrepreneurs harboring a “cashless vision” for Vietnam where everyone can pay using their mobile phones.Originally, it was conceived as a SIM-based mobile wallet for telecom operator Vinaphone, allowing users to transfer money or top-up their mobile credit.The company later released app versions for Android and iOS in 2014.MoMo’s mobile-only approach has been key to its early success, having reportedly cornered more than half of the market share in Vietnam’s digital wallet space.With a user base of 31 million, MoMo now aspires to build a full-fledged financial ecosystem that enables users, small businesses, and financial services providers to tap onto the platform.The question is: Can its super-app ambition survive intense competition and a landscape where traditional banks still dominate?Leadinga crowded spaceAlongside its new headquarters, MoMo also introduced a star-studded AI Committee to implement what it calls an AI-first strategy. The team includes veteran engineers who previously worked at Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, VNG, and FPT Group.Members of MoMo’s AI Committee with the company’s vice chairman and co-founder Nguyen Ba Diep (first from right). / Photo credit: MoMoThe move follows MoMo’s acquihire of local AI startup Pique in June 2021. Pique creates AI-enabled recommendations for businesses to get customers engaged and buy more.The deal is expected to help MoMo better use and monetize its trove of data. The company says it allocates 20% to 25% of its technology budget for AI and wants to up its total number of engineers to 1,000 within this year.The fintech unicorn certainly has the resources to attract talent now. According to Tech in Asia data, MoMo has raised about US$433 million in disclosed funding, pulling far ahead of most domestic competitors.Notably, in MoMo’s latest fundraise, Mizuho Bank bought a 7.5% stake in the fintech firm, which is reportedly worth US$175 million. Mizuho also has a 15% stake in Vietcombank, a major commercial bank in Vietnam that clocked in US$1.1 billion in profit in 2021.It’s no surprise that investors are still willing to bet on Vietnam’s overcrowded fintech space. In 2021 alone, the sector attracted more than US$580 million in funding.See also:The key players in Vietnam’s fintech battlegroundThe country’s internet economy is projected to grow 29% annually until 2025, according to the Google-led 2021 SEA e-Conomy report. Much of the optimism has to do with the potential runway to offer financial services for Vietnam’s unbanked and underbanked population.For years, MoMo had to make up for its independence by aggressively expanding its network of merchants and users through discounts and marketing, sealing partnerships with companies like Lazada, Tiki, Apple, and Google to expand its user base quickly.But there might be limits to this approach. Rivals like ZaloPay can leverage users from Zalo, while AirPay (now rebranded as ShopeePay) can tap into Shopee’s dominance in Vietnam.In 2021, ZaloPay burned through approximately US$52 million. Its potential to create synergy with Zalo messenger, which has about 52 million users in the country, has been enormously untapped.See also:Zalo beat WhatsApp in Vietnam.

This could potentially limit MoMo’s growth, notes Huy Pham, a finance lecturer at RMIT University in Vietnam and the founder of RMIT Fintech-Crypto Hub.Last year, Shopee rebranded its food delivery and payment services in Vietnam to ShopeeFood and ShopeePay, respectively, to signal increased synergies with the main ecommerce platform.“This is why MoMo is trying to make a transition from being a payment intermediary to co-developing more tailored products with its partners such as banks or insurance providers,” says Pham.Can’t live by wallets aloneThe industry consensus is that fintech companies can’t grow or even survive by offering e-wallet services alone as the margins are too thin.“With respect to people’s finances, there are five main activities: earn, spend, borrow, save, and invest. MoMo should participate in all that,” says Nam Le, a principal at Vietnam-focused investor Touchstone Partners.Photo credit: MoMoIn 2019, Pham Thanh Duc, CEO of MoMo parent company M_Service, told TechCrunch that “the playbook is very much based upon the success of Alibaba’s Alipay and Tencent’s WeChat Pay services in China, which went from payments to loans and investing and more.”MoMo is moving toward that direction. In August 2021, it launched a buy now, pay later service with TPBank that enables e-wallet users to borrow up to 10 million dong (US$438) based on their credit scores calculated by MoMo. Users of this BNPL service don’t need to show proof of their income. The feature particularly targets customers who have no access to credit cards.In January, the fintech firmbought a stake in Nhanh.vn, a startup that offers sales management software to small businesses in Vietnam. This second acquisition is part of MoMo’s push to offer multiple services to SMEs, which make up 98% of all businesses in the country.“Being tight with SMEs is a good thing,” says Angus Mackintosh, founder of CrossASEAN Research. “It’s a high-growth segment for companies in Indonesia such as Bukalapak. You can enable these small businesses to use digital payments, source goods, and provide small or working capital loans.”MoMo has declined to reveal more details to Tech in Asia when asked about its strategies to compete outside the e-wallet space. However, the company noted in its series E announcement that its priorities include providing services to SMEs and expanding to lower-tier cities and rural areas.In an interview with Bloomberg, MoMo co-founder and chairman Nguyen Manh Tuong said 40% of the company’s users live outside big cities. He believes that MoMo’s payment business could be “attractive” to farming communities, whose members often have to travel long distances to pay bills.This is a matter of survival for the fintech firm “since the e-wallet usage is a lot lower in those areas,” Pham of RMIT University observes. “MoMo might need to experiment with new products that target residents in rural areas where agriculture dominates.”Immense challengesBut this next phase of growth for MoMo can be long and winding.For one, existing regulations haven’t exactly favored e-wallet providers. All digital wallets in Vietnam must be linked to bank accounts, which is a handicap given banking penetration in rural areas is low.Customers of this tea shop in Vietnam can use a variety of e-wallets to pay. / Photo credit: Truong Van ViThe question becomes: What can the e-wallet offer that the bank can’t?“Most people in big cities have access to the traditional banking system, easily obtain a credit card that offers a similar BNPL option, and the credit limit is a lot higher than the 10 million dong BNPL limit of MoMo,” says RMIT University’s Pham.Another restriction is that e-wallet providers are not allowed to directly offer loans to consumers unless they have a lending license. This means that MoMo has to partner with banks to offer other value-added financial services, or it can just act as a consumer acquisition channel for the bank. Even in such cases, the ultimate relationship with the consumer still lies with the bank.However, Le of Touchstone Partners is optimistic about those potential partnerships. “By leveraging traditional banks’ balance sheets, both can benefit from the digital adoption of e-wallets,” he explains, referring to the banks’ capacity to lend. “MoMo can position itself as a technology partner rather than a direct competitor.”But Vietnamese commercial banks don’t sit on the sidelines waiting to be disrupted. As the fintech fever grips Vietnam, these banks have also been aggressively investing in digital transformation. In fact, several of the top 10 finance apps in the country (in terms of year-on-year growth in downloads and monthly active users) belong to traditional banks.Another Goliath in the financial services race is Viettel, Vietnam’s largest telecom operator, which generated US$1.7 billion profit in 2021. Last January, the group rebranded itself to transform from a traditional telco to a digital services provider, a rare move for a state-owned entity. Tech in Asia previously analyzed why Viettel could have an edge with mobile money.Photo credit: ViettelNot just in digital payments, foreign fintech companies such as Atome and Kredivo (BNPL) as well as Validus and Funding Societies (SME financing) are also willing to bet big on Vietnam.In particular, Funding Societies, which recently raised US$294 million, has sealed a partnership with VNG. The latter contributed US$22.5 million in the round that also involved SoftBank. VNG owns ZaloPay, one of MoMo’s closest competitors in the e-wallet space.A spokesperson from Funding Societies told Tech in Asia that the company and VNG Group could create a “seamless customer experience” across lending, payments, spend management, and other services for SMEs.Future prospectsA “logical progression” for MoMo is to become a digital bank, says Mackintosh. That, of course, is only possible if the Vietnamese government grants such a license.Unlike its Southeast Asian neighbors, Vietnam’s existing digital banks have to be tied to their traditional counterparts. As an example, Timo, which in January raised US$20 million in a round led by Square Peg, operates as a digital-only bank under a partnership with Viet Capital Bank.For MoMo, there’s also a prospect of an IPO down the road, which CEO Pham Thanh Duc previouslytold Reuters that it could take place in 2025.See also:Why Vietnam is missing out on SEA’s IPO partyIn an analysis for Smartkarma, Alec Tseung of Hong Kong’s KT Capital Group wrote that “from an investor’s perspective, the future success of MoMo largely depends on whether it manages to diversify from e-wallets and payments into a complete financial ecosystem” within the next three to five years.The analyst pointed out that Ant Financial’s non-digital payments businesses (such as lending, insurance, and investments) contributed about half of its total revenue but only about 7% of its total transaction value in 2019. The company hasn’t disclosed more recent numbers after its IPO fell through in 2020.Tseung estimates that MoMo’s take rate – which refers to the average fee it earns from facilitating transactions and payments – is around 3%. “Take rate will be the most sensitive factor in determining the valuation of the company and the return for investors,” Tseung said in an interview with Tech in Asia.Photo credit: Andy Feng / ShutterstockDespite the challenges, MoMo arguably still has one of the most recognizable brands in the domestic consumer tech market. One of its hugely popular features is Lắc xì, which is released annually during the Tết (Lunar New Year) campaign. The game, which attracts millions of players, lets you earn prizes from the God of Fortune.But the issue is how to get people to stick around afterwards. “MoMo has served as a fintech leader and pushed innovation over the last decade,” says Pham of RMIT University, who adds it’s now time for the company to “reinvent once again.”",We dissect the challenges for the Vietnamese unicorn as it plows ahead in the country’s fintech battleground.,162517,Thu Huong Le,True,Terence Lee and Lorenzo Kyle Subido,0,"['Analysis', 'Fintech', 'Premium Content']","['Digital banking in Vietnam', 'digital payment', 'digital payment firms', 'ewallets', 'fintech vietnam', 'Momo Vietnam', 'Vietnam', 'Vietnam startup', 'vietnam startup ecosystem']",False,,True,True,True,False,9

However, it wants to focus on serving the “nano and micro segment,” which refers to household businesses or solo sellers that cannot afford to invest in point-of-sale software and other online infrastructure.See also:Can Indonesia’s Shopify-like startups usurp ecommerce giants?Nam estimates that Vietnam has about 16 million small businesses, of which the “nano and micro” retailersare particularly underserved.The pandemic has further aggravated retailers’ struggles, with most having troubles going online. “Even those who can sell via social, everything is done manually,” says Nam. “Selling on social media is like putting classified ads. You don’t really have a proper catalog or other tools to manage the orders.”The SoBanHang app enables retailers to build an online store, create promotions, manage inventory, and track in-store sales and information about loyal customers. According to the company, its app serves about 170,000 merchants. The app is currently free, but the startup plans to roll out a subscription model soon.Unlike other B2B ecommerce startups like Telio or VinShop that have to invest heavily in logistics and warehouses, SoBanHang remains mobile-only and asset-light, according to Nam.

Get the newsletter in your inbox everyday with a Premium subscription.Hello reader,I’m ashamed to admit that I rarely watch even the greatest Hollywood movies unless I think it might help with work.But I had to give Rocky a shot because its underdog tale of determination and grit inspires people from all walks of life, even today.The story of the Philippines’ crypto firms, which had been overlooked by the country’s startup ecosystem, is not that different.Just as Rocky rose as an unlikely contender to the mighty Apollo Creed through unconventional training, crypto startups in the Philippines do not fit into conservative investment mandates but have secured sizable funding rounds.These startups have done so by adopting tech amid the Covid-19 pandemic. They have also used their knowledge of the crypto space to get ahead of the curve.I hope this story gives you a chance to take a look at some of the country’s startups that have flown under the radar, because every champion was once a contender who refused to give up.Today we look at:The potential rise of a new crypto hub in AsiaA former Grab executive driving Carsome’s operations in ThailandOther newsy highlights such as Singapore Press Holdings’ reported sale of a car marketplace, and the closure of an Indonesian agritech startup’s warehouses.Premium summaryRaining crypto in the PhilippinesImage credit: Timmy LoenThe Philippines could be Asia’s next crypto hub as local startups in the space are securing money at rising valuations.Crypto players are also driving financial inclusion for the country’s unbanked as they leapfrog the banking system by putting crypto wallets into people’s hands.One factor that has contributed to the growth of these startups is the Covid-19 pandemic, which has created the ideal setting for tech like crypto to come to the fore. Amid falling incomes and  growing unemployment due to the global health crisis, play-to-earn (P2E) games such as Axie Infinity have helped push crypto adoption in the Philippines.Laying low: Some of the country’s crypto players have been flying under the radar but have gotten sizable funding. These include blockchain P2E startup Yield Guild Games and NFT generator BreederDAO, the first two Philippine companies to receive backing from Silicon Valley VC Andreessen Horowitz.Crypto frenzy: Crypto ownership is on the rise. About 4% of the population – or over 4.3 million people – have crypto assets, according to research by TripleA. In 2021, the Philippines made it to the top 20 countries in Chainalysis’ Global Crypto Adoption Index, which ranks countries according to total cryptocurrency activity.Turn of the tide: Fundraising was a lot harder in 2018 than it was in 2020, and a lot of it had to do with how much money there was to go around, said Nichel Gaba, founder and CEO of Philippine Digital Asset Exchange (PDAX). He added that in 2021, PDAX started seeing more of the global mega funds look at crypto firms.Read more: The Philippines: Asia’s next crypto hub?News spotlightEx-Grab exec joins Carsome in ThailandCarsome, a Malaysia-based car marketplace, has appointed Siwaphume Lertsansaran as its managing director in Thailand.

688675,2022-03-01T03:00:49,2022-03-01T03:26:31,Unearthing Sea Group’s alumni network,unearthing-sea-groups-alumni-network,visual-story,"This is the latest version of the article that was published on June 7, 2021. We’ve added more alumni members to the visual and table.In a world where unicorns hog headlines, Asia Partners’ Nick Nash says the growth equity firm has its eyes on the “baby rhinoceri running around” instead. He’s referring to the startups that are underrated, humble, thick-skinned, and authentic.Earlier this March, Asia Partners announced the close of its inaugural fund for startups in Southeast Asia at a significant US$384 million.Nash, the firm’s co-founder and managing partner, knows a thing or two about the rhinos Asia Partners is betting on firsthand. After all, he is the former group president of Sea Group, what used to be an underrated company which now has a market cap of about US$76.7 billion.Garena, Sea’s gaming arm, has continued to be on a steady growth path. The company’s ecommerce vertical, Shopee, has dominated Southeast Asia within just a few years, keeping competitors like Lazada on their toes.So we wanted to know just how much impact can a company’s growth – and the way it is growing – affect what its alumni do?As Tech in Asia found out, that answer is woven into the innate workings of the startups founded by these alumni. And much like in the case of Grab and Gojek’s networks, as we have chronicled previously, the companies founded by former Sea employees are spread out across various verticals.This is perhaps because those who worked at the company were able to garner a diverse set of experiences before striking out on their own.In a lot of ecommerce companies, team members usually manage a very specific part of the business, says Weizeng (Wilson) Zhang, founder of Thailand-based electronics trading platform Remobie. “But [at Sea] I got to learn how to be a jack-of-all-trades since Shopee gave me a lot of hands-on experiences in different fields – from marketing to operations.”Entrepreneur Keren Wang’s experience at Shopee was similar. Wang spent close to five years working in and with different departments in the firm like marketing and cross-border operations before founding an ecommerce enabler called AladdinCommerce in Singapore late last year.The company helps digitize traditional retailers and onboards them onto platforms such as Shopee and Lazada. Most of AladdinCommerce’s clients are in Singapore and China.“These are traditional brick-and-mortar businesses, and we help them with everything from taking professional photos to setting up video-streaming and shop optimization,” says Wang.Her experience on Shopee’s team has given her insight into what is usually expected of these small businesses when they go online. “You need to know the rules of the game to play the game,” she says.As you scan our network map, it may seem like the web of Sea founders may not be as extensive as Grab, Gojek, or Lazada’s. But many believe that Sea’s promising growth trajectory has inspired its staff to stay on with the company.“Risk-takers are always in a minority. People who left the company during my tenure there did mainly to join other companies,” says Zhang.See also: The growing Lazada mafiaIn some cases, like-minded colleagues have also left Sea to start new ventures. Perhaps the most prominent example is that of Asia Partners’ Nash and Vorapol (Brook) Supanusonti, a former senior executive at Sea who was also among the co-founders of Asia Partners. At Remobie, meanwhile, three of the company’s four founders, Zhang, Krittin Tantisawetrat, and Karintorn Tungtawee, are Shopee alumni.There’re good reasons to stay on at Sea, many feel. Shopee, for instance, “invests a lot in its people,” says Tran Le Thanh Nhu, co-founder of Schola, an edtech venture based out of Singapore and Vietnam.Fresh out of college, Tran kick-started her career by joining Garena in 2013 as a product marketing manager. Her tasks varied from launching the popular game ThunderStrike in Vietnam to pushing out an entertainment platform called Talk Talk.Schola, which she co-founded in 2018, teaches English-speaking skills to children between the ages of four and 15 using gamified STEM subjects in a curriculum designed by Cambridge-certified educators. Spread across Vietnam, Thailand, South Korea, and Japan, the company now has over 10,000 students.Others echo Tran’s views on the quality of not just Sea’s hires, but also its culture.“I can’t underscore enough that I genuinely believe I was working with some of the smartest minds in Southeast Asia while I was at Shopee,” says Akash Hegde, co-founder of India-based business-to-business ecommerce platform ShakeDeal.The company takes care of its employees and offers perks comparable to other tech companies around the world, says Hegde, a Forbes 30 Under 30 inductee who was part of Shopee’s team in its early days.Network is kingWhile ecommerce-related ventures stand out prominently among the firms that were started by ex-Sea staff, there are also a fair number of esports-related startups in the mix. The network map also shows companies in verticals such as fintech, edtech, and cryptocurrency.A majority of these startups are still in their early days. Unlike the Gojek and Grab mafias, only a handful of these companies such as Una Brands, Hypefast, and EruidiFi seemed to have raised VC funding till early 2021.Alumni firms like India-based decentralized finance startup Pillow and Indonesian payments provider Durianpay, which have been established more recently, seem to have more luck with funding.While some startups haven’t disclosed the amount of funding they’ve raised, most of those that have received funding are in the seed stage, confirming the nascency of Sea’s mafia entrepreneur network.That said, the network already has a couple of heavy hitters. For instance, Jumei, a China-based online cosmetics company, went public in a US$430 million stock market debut in 2014. Meanwhile, Bitkub, a Thailand-based cryptocurrency exchange, was acquired for US$536 million in November 2021.Some Sea alumni have also crossed over to the other side of the table. Investment firms Asia Partners and Teko Ventures were founded by Nick Nash, the former group president at Sea, and Mai Thanh Binh, who founded Garena Vietnam, respectively.Binh, in particular, also founded Garena Vietnam in 2009 and Vietnam’s second tech unicorn VNLife two years prior in 2007.Sea’s remarkable strides have undoubtedly given its alumni an upper hand. “It’s easier for me to get clients because of my previous experience at Shopee – they trust me because of that,” says Wang.“[Shopee’s] amazing track record got us a lot of credibility when we were starting out,” says Remobie’s Zhang, whose company has sold about 150,000 units of phones in the two years it’s been around.The alumni network is a gift that keeps on giving. Shopee’s leadership, says Zhang, continues to be caring even after he and his co-founders have moved out. “They always ask how they can help us,” he says.Some alumni say they were also able to leverage the company’s platforms, like in the case of AladdinCommerce and Remobie. The latter works with different brands – including ones in telecom – to run trade-in programs for phones as well as office electronics. Shopee has been partnering with Remobie for these trade-in programs since last year.The right network may even open doors that were previously unseen. Singapore-based ecommerce aggregator Una Brands is currently hiring, and Luke Ong, an ex-Shopee team member who is part of the founding team at Una Brands, believes Sea’s alumni could be a good fit at the company.“They are qualified and have worked in a high-growth startup before, so they know the difficulties and challenges that come with high-growth startups,” he says. In one of the largest seed rounds in the region, Una Brands raised US$40 million in May 2021.Remaining hungrySea’s steady growth has only made this network more confident: The company’s upward trajectory comes as a reminder that they’ve learned all the right to-dos of business.Schola’s Tran says her colleagues at Garena “were very hungry to solve different problems.”The word hungry comes up more than once to describe Sea’s employees in Tech in Asia’s conversations with the company’s alumni, including with Ong.He joined Shopee in 2018 on the cross-border ecommerce team, focusing on China-based brands selling to the Singapore market.His job involved managing brands across categories and handling returns, which offered him a chance to see how logistics worked at an ecommerce company. Incidentally, this exposure eventually led Ong to move to Ninja Van before becoming a part of Una Brands.See also: Does the dawn of in-house ecommerce delivery threaten third-party logistics firms?In his current role, Ong interacts with brand owners across platforms, including Shopee, Amazon, and Lazada. He says his experience at Shopee offers him “an intimate understanding of how it works on the inside.” “It has helped me understand what brand and category managers focus on while choosing to promote or not promote a brand or the mechanisms behind flash deals and brand launches,” he shares.For ShakeDeal co-founder Hegde, working with Shopee in its early days gave him a front-row seat to how a company could be scaled up. “From building a product to taking it to market, acquiring customers, to nitty gritties of handling operations, like tying up with 3PLs (third-party logistics) and figuring out payment modes, I ingested all that from Shopee,” he says.Among other things, Hegde also learned how significant recommendation engines can be for an ecommerce business at Shopee. These recommendation engines, he says, enable cross-selling and personalization, which can make a world of difference for ecommerce businesses.He also saw firsthand how Shopee’s leadership, CEO Chris Feng in particular, prioritized long-term solutions over short-term fixes.“If there’s a jar that’s leaking and there’s constant inflow of water, the solution isn’t just to patch up the holes but to turn off the tap. And Chris was absolutely right when he taught us that, urging us to get to the core of any problem,” recalls Hegde.The forward marchDespite the Covid-19 pandemic, it’s been a busy time for some of Sea Group’s alumni, who have launched new startups in the period.Not surprisingly, most of the startups Tech in Asia surveyed are in the ecommerce space, with former Shopee employees setting out to start their own ecommerce ventures. And many who were with Garena have also launched gaming-related ventures.A few have also set up businesses in areas such as insurtech and blockchain, including Indonesia-based insurtech company Rey, minority-focused VC firm Bridge Young Things, or PathDAO, a startup that works in the blockchain gaming and metaverse spaces.At least six companies in Southeast Asia’s crypto and blockchain-focused space have founders from the Sea alumni network. Perhaps the most prominent of these companies is Bitkub, a crypto exchange and the latest unicorn to come out of Thailand.Singapore serves as headquarter to most firms within the Sea alumni, while Indonesia comes second.Some Sea alumni like Wafa Taftazani have also established multiple startups in Indonesia. Having set up Modal Rakyat, a working-capital enabler for startups and SMEs, in 2018, Taftazani launched two startups in 2021. One of them is VCGamers, a gaming ecommerce platform in Indonesia, and the other is UpBanx, a fintech platform for creators and brands.It’s a playbook that’s worked well for those who’ve previously worked at Shopee. And as for Shopee itself, the ecommerce platform has also been steadily expanding outside Southeast Asia, making its foray into Latin America, Europe, and India.And while Shopee still has to prove it can grow in its newer markets, its move to spread its tentacles bodes well for Sea’s alumni network.What most alumni agree on is that there’s going to be a lot more startups by the Sea mafia in the next couple of years. Give it two to three years for more startups to emerge from the Sea network, says Ong, adding that the current Sea mafia might just be a precursor to the new startups waiting in the wings. Perhaps, like Sea, the startups founded or soon-to-be founded by its alumni are also baby rhinos, just biding their time.CreditsGraphics: Timmy LoenEditing: Tay Tian Wen, Arpit Nayak, Thu Huong Le, Terence Lee, and Jaclyn Tiu","Taking advantage of skill sets honed at the Sea Group, the company’s alumni have gone on to launch startups in different verticals.",456076,Nikita Puri,True,,0,"['Premium Content', 'Visual Stories']","['alumni network', 'ex-garena', 'ex-shopee', 'Garena', 'garena alumni', 'sea alumni', 'Sea Group', 'shopee', 'shopee alumni', 'Startup Mafias', 'startup network']",False,,True,True,True,False,8

The brutal reality is that all of us have bills to pay and aspirations to achieve, so when new opportunities come knocking on our doors – offering better salaries or career progression – it often makes sense to welcome them with open arms.That was perhaps the case for several former employees of Capital A (formerly known as AirAsia) and MyTukar. A fair number of ex-staff from the two companies are now employed by Malaysian used-car platform Carsome, an occurrence that some say was not a coincidence.Today we look at:The key executives that Capital A and MyTukar lost to Carsome in 2021 What fresh funds will do for this ex-Gojek exec’s new startup Other newsy highlights such as Alibaba’s profits taking a hit and more money going into NFTsPremium summaryTo another pastureImage credit: Timmy LoenAirAsia rebranded itself earlier this year as Capital A and is bolstering its super-app ambitions. Meanwhile, MyTukar, the Malaysian unit of Singaporean automotive marketplace Carro, underwent a reorganization and is looking to grow its market share soon. This has led to a change in leadership and some employees jumping ship at the two firms. A notable number of their ex-staff have joined Carsome, Malaysia’s first unicorn.From the numbers: Tech in Asia has found that about 13 junior and senior executives from AirAsia’s marketing and tech divisions, as well as 12 junior and senior staff from MyTukar’s business development division, left to join Carsome in 2021.Not a coincidence: A former AirAsia employee with knowledge of the matter says these movements were unique, as many who left the airline claimed to have been poached by Carsome, which wanted to beef up its digital marketing and tech units. Insiders familiar with the matter also tell Tech in Asia that they knew that Carsome had made offers to a number of MyTukar staff across different divisions.But not on purpose?: Carsome has denied targeting talent “from any company,” with a spokesperson telling Tech in Asia that “there is no attempt as alleged.”Read more: Capital A, MyTukar lost key execs to Carsome in 2021Startup spotlightVroom vroom, goes BroomImage credit: Timmy LoenVroom!

Delivered every Monday via email and through the Tech in Asia website, this free newsletter breaks down the biggest stories and latest trends on Asia’s publicly-listed tech companies. If you’re not a subscriber, get access by registering here.Hello reader,With Russia’s invasion of Ukraine driving the knife deeper into languishing global stock markets, we decided to take a look at those brave enough to make their debut amid bearish red flags.The IPO market isn’t exactly hot right now, with a few new issuers either delaying or trimming the size of their listings. But that hasn’t stopped swathes of high-profile IPOs from quietly simmering under the surface.Asian tech companies have been doing plenty of IPO-related groundwork recently – from changes in citizenship to drawing executives from competitors. A closer look at the scene will reveal the various approaches these firms are taking.Image credit: Timmy LoenFor instance, Shein, the fast-fashion giant, appears to be doing whatever it can to bypass China’s tougher rules for offshore IPOs.Not only did the retailer shift its parent firm to Singapore – similar to the move made by super app Grab (GRAB, NDAQ) – but its founder and CEO, Chris Xu, also became a permanent resident of the city-state. These developments come following reports that suggested Shein was looking to list in New York later this year.Meanwhile, IPO-bound FinAccel, the parent company of Kredivo, an Indonesia-based buy now, pay later service, has stoked investor interest by taking the M&amp;A route. FinAccel raised its stake in Bank Bisnis Internasional (BBSI, IDX) from 40% to 75% in a bid to claim a chunk of Indonesia’s fast-growing digibank market.Akulaku, another fintech unicorn heading for the public market, managed to line its coffers by raising US$100 million in a series E round. However, that wasn’t the case for Alibaba (BABA, NDAQ), which shelved plans to raise US$1 billion for Lazada before Southeast Asian firm’s IPO.The bad news doesn’t end there for the Chinese ecommerce giant as it posted its slowest revenue growth since going public last week. You can find a detailed review of Alibaba’s financial health here.Carousell, on the other hand, offered a glimpse into its financial performance in the lead-up to its debut on the public market, which might happen as soon as this current quarter. In this premium story, we break down the key aspects of the online classifieds firm’s 2020 earnings result.Carsome, Carousell’s competitor in the automobile space, has been beefing up its digital marketing and tech units in a peculiar manner. Malaysia’s first unicorn has been gearing up to dive into public markets this year and, as my colleague Emmanuel reports in this premium story, it has made a habit of luring a host of junior and senior staff from rival firms.Most companies prefer to keep their IPO plans on the down-low, but Singapore-based PropertyGuru doesn’t beat around the bush. Despite having already announced the firm’s intention to list in the US last year, PropertyGuru’s CEO went a step further to confirm that the listing will take place by the end of the first quarter this year.— Shravanth4 Stocks to watchHot stocks, earnings reports, restructuring, activist investor pressure, and more. We feature the stocks that are likely to make big moves during the week.Image credit: Timmy Loen🇸🇬 Grab (GRAB, NDAQ): It’s no secret that the super app has had a tough time since it made its public market debut in December. Its beleaguered investors will hope for some respite when Grab reports its Q4 results on March 3.🇮🇳 Vodafone Idea Ltd (IDEA, NSE):  The troubled telecommunications firms could be in line for a much-need capital infusion after British parent Vodafone Group said it plans to sell up to a 5% stake in tower firm Indus Towers to Bharti Airtel (BHARTIARTL, NSE). “The two sides are in discussions and things could move very fast in the next few weeks,” a source told The Economic Times.🇨🇳 Baidu Inc (BIDU, NYSE): Despite initially feeling the full force of China’s crackdown, the tech giant has managed to weather the storm to some extent, with its shares shedding just around 2.5% over the last six months. The Chinese search engine has reportedly laid off nearly 10% to 15% of its total employees.The question on everyone’s minds is whether Baidu can now shift gears and reverse its fortunes. A few answers are likely when it reports its Q4 results on March 1.🇮🇳Infosys Ltd (INFY, NSE): Erm.. hockey, anyone? India’s second-largest software services firm by revenue believes the metaverse – the much hyped next step in the evolution of the internet – will see “hockey stick-shaped growth” very soon. That’s why the company has been aggressively building an array of solutions revolving around the metaverse.3 Market WhispersA lot more reliable than a whisper as we highlight engaging source-based reporting from reputable news outlets around the globe.Photo credit: 123rf1️⃣ Halting a pandemic-induced slide: Over 200 of AirAsia’s fleet of 260 planes have remained idle since the pandemic hit airlines around the world in 2020. Yet, Capital A (CAPITALA, KLSE) CEO Tony Fernandes says he remains bullish not only his airline’s prospects but also its super-app ambitions in this insightful interview. Capital A’s annual results for 2021 are expected this week.2️⃣ A nip in the bud: Blackstone Inc (BX, NYSE) and Toshiba Corp (6502, TYO) moved swiftly to deny reports that the US-based private equity firm had made a buyout offer for the US$18 billion Japanese conglomerate. Toshiba said in a statement that no specific proposals, “including preliminary and initial ones, were brought to Toshiba, including those from Blackstone, to take Toshiba private.”3️⃣ An IPO on the way: Swiggy has begun preparations to raise at least $800 million in an IPO early next year. The Indian food delivery decacorn is looking to raise the funds in order to expand its market share amid stiff competition from Zomato in the food delivery space.Meanwhile, Swiggy’s quick commerce business is also challenged by the Reliance Industries-backed Dunzo, Tata Group’s BigBasket, Zomato-backed Blinkit, and Y Cominator-funded Zepto.2 Quotes from the wiseWitty excerpts that leave you either scratching your head or grinning at your screen. Tech in Asia honors the changemakers of our time and of days gone by.“It is my belief that the next 1,000 unicorns won’t be a search engine, won’t be a media company, they’ll be businesses developing green hydrogen, green agriculture, green steel and green cement,” said Larry Fink, BlackRock (BLK, NYSE) CEO, talking about the businesses potential in the need to address climate change.“If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.” This famous quote is somewhat dubiously attributed to the founder of the Ford Motor Company (F, NYSE), Henry Ford, who was the chief developer of the assembly line technique that kickstarted the mass production of automobiles.1 News you should knowWe spotlight the story that has got everyone talking and social media buzzing during the past week.Photo credit: Samuel Zeller / Unsplash.VR headsets and insurance: There has been a lot of distressing news (pandemic, wars, inflation, and so on) in the headlines lately. Amid the doom and gloom, news that Sony Group (6758, TYO) had revealed the design for its next-generation PlayStation VR2 headset went largely under the radar.Tech advancements in virtual reality hardware have accelerated. However, regardless of how immersive the experience is, players of VR games are still inescapably rooted in the physical world. When gamers forget that, bad things happen (in other words, expensive equipment gets broken). Hard to believe?

The Filipino American expressed his “occasional frustrations with how the Philippine startup scene is portrayed” to Tech in Asia.Photo credit: 123.rf / ursula1964He believes that the country’s billion-dollar investment outcomes are being ignored, thanks to a startup ecosystem that is largely driven by “corporate VCs that have conservative investment mandates.” These investors tend to miss what’s happening in the crypto world, which he says has become “such a major source of innovation” in the Philippines.Indeed, more crypto startups in the country are becoming prominent and securing money at rising valuations.Nichel Gaba, founder and CEO of Philippine Digital Asset Exchange (PDAX), echoes this view and cited how Covid-19 was a catalyst for this development. “The pandemic, as horrible as it is, created the ideal setting for a technology like crypto to come to the fore. The industry was able to showcase the power of decentralization because the centralized structures weren’t working well.”Among the up-and-comers are familiar names that have been around since the early 2010s and newer players that are flying under the radar but securing sizable funding.These include YGG and non-fungible token generator BreederDAO, the first two Philippines-based companies to receive funding from Silicon Valley VC Andreessen Horowitz (a16z).A16z’s investments in BreederDAO and YGG, in particular, have boosted interestin crypto among the country’s investors and entrepreneurs and are “encouraging more locals to explore this space,” says Joan Yao, vice president of investments at local VC Kickstart Ventures.Kickstart is an early investor in Coins.ph, one of the first blockchain-powered platforms to break into the Philippines’ mainstream consumer market.“Local” crypto startups still matterGiven the borderless nature of cryptocurrencies, many startups in the space have remote teams – it doesn’t matter where the founders are from.Indeed, some crypto startups that once considered making Singapore their headquarters are now heading to cities like Dubai for this very reason.See also: Is Dubai stealing Singapore’s thunder in crypto?That said, crypto startups still place a premium on being close to their customers and users, and crypto adoption still requires distinctly local approaches.In the Philippines, crypto ownership is growing. About 4% of the population – or 4.36 million people – own some crypto, according to research by TripleA. In 2021, the Philippines made it to the top 20 countries in Chanalysis’ Global Crypto Adoption Index, which measures peer-to-peer exchange trade volume, on-chain value received, and on-chain retail value received.What ties many Filipino crypto startups together is the use of blockchain to address real-world needs in a country with weak financial inclusion and a population battered by the pandemic’s economic blows.At 47%, the Philippines has the second-biggest unbanked population in Southeast Asia. Combine that with the country’s high mobile penetration rate of 138%, and fintech startups have found plenty of opportunities to leapfrog the banking system by putting crypto wallets into people’s hands.Lower incomes and rising unemployment due to Covid-19 have also helped push crypto adoption through P2E games.Before the pandemic, wages and salary employment in the Philippines were growing. But the global health crisis reversed these gains, “wiping out 1.7 million wage and salary jobs in the 12 months to January 2021” and driving about 435,000 to find work in the informal sector, according to the Asian Development Bank.Playing Axie Infinity, a P2E game created by Vietnam-based Sky Mavis, became a lifeline for many Filipinos. The real minimum wage in the country currently stands at 493.57 pesos (US$9.61) a day in the National Capital Region and can go as low as 266.32 (US$5) in the provinces. In contrast, Axie Infinity players were earning as much as 6,000 pesos (around US$117) a day in 2021, although that rate proved to be unsustainable.See also: Axie Infinity faces big test as player earnings fallYGG was instrumental in growing Axie Infinity’s popularity. After seeing how P2E gaming gave Filipinos a financial boost, Gabby Dizon “came up with the idea of creating a global network of players helping each other get started with NFT games.” That’s how YGG was born.The Axie Infinity marketplace / Photo credit: Emfarsis ConsultingDizon built YGG at a time when NFTs – especially NFT games – were far from mainstream. “We had to put a lot of effort into spreading awareness and education about the use cases of NFT gaming and how it can revolutionize gaming, together with the impact it can create in society,” the co-founder adds.For many players, P2E introduced them to the fast-moving, volatile world of crypto. Says Dizon, “They don’t learn crypto by trading, learning derivatives, or doing enterprise blockchain. Here, people are learning it through gaming first.”See also: A16z’s first Philippine bet is shaking up blockchain gamingAs more people got into crypto through P2E, the demand rose for services that would allow them to cash out or spend their digital assets on more tangible things. Companies like PDAX are working to make this process seamless.“Nobody teleports into the crypto space. You go from your Philippine pesos from the real economy, into the digital economy,” says Gaba of PDAX.To that end, XLD Finance has built an app that lets people pay for bills using stablecoins or SLP – aka small love potion, the in-game currency of Axie Infinity.YGG’s Goltra adds that the Philippines’ comfort level with English, a positive-sum culture of its crypto scene, and a central bank that has clear crypto regulations and a progressive stance towards the tech have contributed to the rise of these blockchain startups in the country.More investors are taking crypto seriouslyCrypto founders report that in the past two years, raising funds has become easier.Perhaps it’s a sign that investors are more comfortable with crypto.It also reflects the wider trend of US investors being more open to backing Southeast Asian startups due to the lower valuations as well as the global mandate of crypto-centric VCs.And then there’s the fact that money in alternative assets has been at an all-time high, at least until the US Federal Reserve announced that it would hike interest rates.Gaba of PDAX says that fundraising was a lot harder in 2018 than it was in 2020, and a lot of it had to do with how much money there was to go around.PDAX founder and CEO Nichel Gaba / Photo credit: PDAX“In 2020 and 2021, when it was becoming clear that markets were more receptive towards crypto, there was more capital deployed to funds that invest in crypto initiatives or crypto startups,” he observes.Before 2020, PDAX was primarily targeted by regional VCs, Filipino angel investors, and strategic partners supportive of fintech. “But by 2021, we started seeing more of the global mega funds look at crypto,” he says.YGG’s first funding round in 2020 was also a bit difficult because NFTs were not yet well understood, but the company quickly gained traction with the help of crypto-focused funds Scalar Capital, Delphi Digital, and Gumi Cryptos Capital. Dizon says that the guild’s fundraising initiatives were much easier because of this support.Traditional VCs are starting to do more in crypto, but they still face barriers in doing so.See also: Are SEA’s tech VCs missing out on the crypto craze?Although big funding rounds led by foreign VCs get hyped up, Yao of Kickstart Ventures notes that there are also “local investors who have made many crypto investments without media attention.”More work, however, needs to be done as most VCs in the Philippines still don’t typically support gaming companies, Dizon says.Growing painsThe rapid growth of startups in this space is not without challenges.For one, first-time crypto holders need better financial literacy and security awareness to make sure they manage their wealth well and avoid scams.The rise of P2E – and the resulting media frenzy – has also caught the tax collector’s attention, although no firm decision has been made about taxing the earnings from such games.And despite the receptiveness of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) toward crypto, more regulation may be coming. The country’s central bank has tightened the rules governing crypto assets in response to the sector’s rapid growth.The BSP headquarters on Roxas Boulevard, Manila / Photo credit: patrickroque01Released in January 2021, the guidelines outline licensing requirements for virtual asset service providers – companies that offer financial services using blockchain, Bitcoin, digital currencies, and the like – to protect against money laundering.Gaba thinks that the most notable addition to earlier frameworks seems to be the “travel rule.” In traditional finance, the rule requires institutions that facilitate money transfers to know who’s sending the money, why they’re sending it, and who’s receiving it. Regulators are trying to do the same for cryptocurrencies.“If you withdraw crypto, the exchange should know where you’re sending it to or to whom. But with crypto, it could be to yourself, so the exchange needs to be able to make that distinction. That’s where the rules are now. A lot of these things are being clarified not just in the Philippines but also globally,” Gaba explains.The future for crypto startupsThe popularity of P2E will likely continue to support growth in other areas of crypto.BSP-licensed crypto exchanges are offering direct pairings between P2E tokens such as Axie Infinity’s SLP and AXS for a smoother on/off ramp experience. Digital banks are also keeping an eye on this community because of the growth it has showcased in the past year,” says Dizon.Local gaming guilds will be key to sustaining the growth of P2E in the Philippines. These organizations work to attract more users and recruit community managers, reach remote players, and secure local partnerships for fiat cashout.Digital assets in general could also see use cases beyond financial services, art, and gaming.Gaba believes that blockchain could mirror the internet’s journey. “In the ‘90s, the internet was seen mainly as an innovation in media – everyone would get to broadcast information. But right now, you have commerce, financial services, and all sorts of things happening on the internet. But the entry point was media.”On the other hand, financial services was “where it all started” for crypto. “Satoshi Nakamoto invented Bitcoin as a solution for challenges in the monetary system … But now, we can do so many things with it,” Gaba concludes.Currency converted from Philippine peso to US dollar: US$1 = 51.40 pesos.","From big venture capital deals to increasing crypto ownership, the Philippines is fast becoming a hub for crypto startups.

We break down the big and messy topics of Asia’s tech and startup community. Get the newsletter in your inbox everyday with a Premium subscription.Hi readers,Have you ever gone for an interview or took a test and left the room feeling like you did a pretty good job, only to find out that you’d flunked it?I imagine that’s how many crypto hopefuls in Singapore must feel.Over 170 firms pursued a digital payments token license in the city-state when the Monetary Authority of Singapore  started accepting applications in early 2020. But since then, an overwhelming number of these applicants have been either rejected or asked to withdraw.While rejection is part of doing business, many contenders say they don’t know why they failed even after a rigorous process that stretched to over a year and involved multiple conversations with the regulator. Many can only guess at the reasons.Here’s what I think: In the high-stakes game of crypto, there’s little incentive for any country or jurisdiction to be a pioneer. A second or third mover, sure. But to be the first? There’s too much on the line, given crypto’s high volatility and reputation as a speculative asset as well as money laundering risks.It’s no wonder why regulators all over the world are being extra cautious. Obtaining a stamp of legitimacy is a huge deal for any crypto operator and could usher in a flood of newcomers and users onto a platform.Till then, it seems that firms will hop from market to market in their search for regulatory approval. And at the moment, Dubai seems pretty high on their list.— Melissa Goh, journalist at Tech in AsiaTop stories this weekImage credit: Timmy Loen1️.

They did, and when the new sofas arrived, we had to figure out what to do with the old ones. They were still in pretty good condition despite us having sat on them for nearly 10 years, and it seemed like such a waste to put them in the dumpster.So we turned to Carousell, listed the sofa set for something like a hundred bucks, and had a buyer lined up and ready to go within hours.The Singapore-based classifieds firm is the go-to place for many people to buy and sell pre-loved items, but it’s also become so much more. Carousell has grown tremendously since it was launched back in 2012, and the road ahead for it seems like an exciting one.Today we look at:Carousell’s 2020 financialsWhat fresh funding will do for this cross-border ecommerce startupOther newsy highlights such as the launch of Glance’s live feature in Indonesia and VNPay’s partnership with Visa in VietnamPremium summaryDiving into Carousell’s financesImage credit: Timmy LoenCarousell is reportedly in talks to go public via a special purpose acquisition company this year, with the joint entity valued at US$1.5 billion. While the region’s tech and startup scene waits to see if this will come to pass, let’s take a look at Carousell’s numbers for its financial year ending December 31, 2020.Gains and losses: In 2020, the online classifieds giant reported a revenue of US$40.6 million, a more than 3x increase from 2019. Its acquisition of 701Search – the marketplace behind Mudah in Malaysia, Cho Tot in Vietnam, and OneKyat in Myanmar – likely drove a bulk of that growth. At the same time, Carousell’s losses before taxes deepened from US$42.2 million to US$63.9 million as its employee headcount ballooned.The price of acquisition: Carousell is increasingly feeling the weight of running a sprawling business. Between 2019 and 2020, the firm’s employee benefits expenses roughly doubled to US$62.6 million. It also saw an increase in expenses on salaries, commissions, and bonuses, growing over 40% to US$32.4 million in the same period.Time will tell: Carousell stands to benefit from a trend toward “recommerce” – or reverse commerce. The revenue potential of the firm’s recent acquisitions, which could open up new revenue streams for the company, have also not yet been reflected in its financial statements.Read more: Carousell triples revenue to $40.6m in 2020Startup spotlightCrossing bordersOCG Founders (L-R) Quan Truong and Phuong Anh Ha/Photo credit: OCGIn the connected world we live in, it’s important for businesses to reach customers beyond their own home markets.

734548,2022-02-25T05:26:50,2022-02-25T06:29:23,This SPH veteran spun off his jobs platform to catch a big wave,sph-veteran-spun-job-platform-catch-big-wave,post,"Julian Tan is not a new name in the startup ecosystem of Southeast Asia, especially in Singapore.More than a decade ago, he started and grew several startups under local media organization Singapore Press Holdings (SPH), such as classified ads platform 701Search – parent company of Berniaga in Indonesia and Mudah.my in Malaysia – and automotive portal SgCarMart.Last year, he decided to spin off startup FastCo from SPH to make the company, which operates blue-collar jobs platform FastJobs, an independent firm. According to Tan, the service has gained good traction and has become one of the top jobs platforms in Singapore, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It currently has more than 450,000 monthly active job seekers on the platform.Recently, the company also launched another app called FastGig that focuses on job seekers who want to operate on a more flexible schedule. For example, job seekers can declare that they only want to work two days per week and only in the morning, and the app will match them with suitable employers.According to the firm, FastJobs’ revenue has been growing steadily, while its operating losses have narrowed. It hit US$2.4 million in revenue in 2020, a 14% surge compared to the previous year. At the same time, the company’s EBITlosses shrunk by 58% to US$162,000.In a statement, the company said that in 2021, it succeeded in doubling its 2020 revenue, making its last year revenue roughly aroundUS$4.8 million.Tan says he decided to spin off the company from SPH because of the huge interest it was getting from investors who wanted to support the business. At the same time, he realized that the jobs space was heating up all around the world, with the emergence of SoftBank-backed Jobandtalent in Europe, Workstream in the US, and even Sampingan and MyRobin in Indonesia.To accommodate the changing environment, Tan restructured the firm’s shareholders.“Today, we have myriad of shareholders, from SPH, venture capitalists, angel investors, as well as the management,” Tan tells Tech in Asia. “We hope it can make the company more agile, grow, and compete as a startup in the region.”His own babyTan has run 701Search and has led its expansion across Southeast Asia since 2008. He was also involved when the company’s Indonesian subsidiary, Berniaga, was acquired by online marketplace OLX in 2014. A year later, Tan went back to SPH to run the media company’s digital businesses.This is when Tan cooked up the idea for FastCo. “I tried to think what else I can do so I’m able to contribute my learning in building a startup in the region,” he recalls.He was aware that there were already so many job portals in Singapore, such as JobStreet, JobsDB, and even LinkedIn. However, he believed those platforms mostly only catered to the white-collar space.“There is an underserved market of non-executive blue-collar workers. And based on my experience of building my previous startup in this region, the segment is the majority of the workforce.”FastCo founder Julian Tan (second from left) with his team / Photo credit: FastCoTan built FastCo under SPH in 2015, and it took only a year for it to become the top blue-collar job platform in Singapore, he says. Aware of the potential, he established a separate entity for the company in 2018 and started expanding to Malaysia and the Philippines. SPH was still the majority shareholder at the time.Tan admits that there was a personal factor behind his decision to run the company by himself. “This is the baby that I started. It’s not a thing that we acquired or invested – we did everything by ourselves,” he explains.According to VentureCap Insights, FastCo raised US$3.9 million in Q3 2018 and US$3.4 million in Q2 last year. However, the data showed that SPH Interactive still holds a 50% stake in the company after those two rounds of funding.In a statement, FastCo said that it now operates independently as a result of a management buyout that was led by VC firm Cento Ventures last year. The process itself is a multistep transaction that is still ongoing. When fully diluted, the stake of SPH Interactive will be around a third of the company.Refuse to be staticThe focus of FastCo is still on growing the number of job seekers and corporate clients on the platform, as well as learning how to match the two parties correctly.The company currently has a strong position in the F&amp;B, retail, warehousing, logistics, and physical security sectors. Going forward, FastCo wants to increase the number of employers and job seekers in those sectors, while expanding to jobs in other businesses such as beauty and wellness.See also: These are the most active investors in Singapore’s startupsBased on his experience, Tan says that the key to success in a startup is making sure that the business model isn’t static. A traditional classifieds platform, for instance, mostly stuck to just connecting supply and demand without trying to go deeper into the transaction, he says.“Meanwhile, we see newer startups such as automotive portals Carro and Carsome, which already take care of the transaction,” Tan shares.That’s why FastCo is innovating to sustain its leadership position and has launched FastGig. The new app targets people who have particular needs in a job setup, such as students and stay-at-home parents. It can also handle payments and make it easier for job seekers to choose a suitable shift.NTUC FairPrice, Domino’s Pizza Singapore, and Phoon Huat have used FastGig to scale their operations during peak times, such as Christmas and the Lunar New Year, according to a statement. Since its launch, the app has fulfilled more than 160,000 work hours for these employers.FastCo founder Julian Tan / Photo credit: FastCoAnother service that FastCo tested in Singapore is a learning feature called FastLearn, where jobseekers can attend training courses to improve their skills.Series A funding in the worksFastCo is now working on its series A round, which will be its first fundraise afterthe spin-off from SPH. “We have started the process last year and are set to close it in the next few months,” Tan shares.While the founder wants to operate in the entire Southeast Asia market, like what he did in the past with 701 Search, he says the company will focus on its existing markets for this year.“After we can be the clear market leader, we will consider to go to other countries,” Tan says.The biggest challenge for FastCo right now is hiring high-quality talent, both in the product and sales divisions. It currently has around 60 employees, with half of them based in Singapore and a quarter each in Malaysia and the Philippines.","Julian Tan’s FastCo, which runs jobs platform FastJobs, is now working on its series A round, its first fundraise after the company’s spin-off from SPH.",86192,Aditya Hadi Pratama,True,Collin Furtado and Jaclyn Tiu,0,"['News', 'Premium Content', 'Profiles', 'Startups']","['blue-collar employment', 'blue-collar jobs marketplace', 'fastco', 'fastgig', 'fastjobs', 'jobs platform', 'julian tan', 'Singapore', 'Singapore Press Holdings', 'SPH']",False,,True,True,True,False,5

732241,2022-02-25T02:00:26,2022-02-24T10:26:14,Optimizing data for strategic decision making in business,optimizing-data-strategic-decision-making-business,post,"The rapid development of tech and increased access to various digital services have resulted in a significant rise in the amount of data we produce. This has made large institutions realize that the value of data has changed and that information can influence decision-making, which has spurred many of these firms to transform into data-driven organizations.However, making this shift is not easy. According to an Accenture survey, only 32% of organizations have gained tangible value from data. This means that there are still large gaps to overcome before companies can optimize the data they gather.One of these challenges is building a tech foundation that can process large amounts of information, as the data an organization collects through tech is multistructured.Google’s answer to this need is Google Cloud. The cloud computing solution transforms data, enabling companies to get optimized data value via a single intelligently enabled platform to get optimized data value.Last October, at the 2021 Google Cloud Next event, the tech giant introduced several new developments and improvements to its services, including BigQuery and Vertex AI.Both services were highlighted in the Innovate and Accelerate with Data Cloud panel, which discussed how organizations can simplify and unify data to optimize it and, in turn, increase enterprise productivity using Google Cloud solutions.Improvements to BigQueryPhoto credit: PexelsBigQuery is a data warehouse that provides solutions for Google Cloud services and can help companies manage and analyze data. With the service, companies don’t have to think about infrastructure and can focus on data analysis to generate reliable insights.Three main improvements were added to BigQuery: the BigQuery interoperability feature, BigQuery Migration Service and Management (currently under preview), and the real-time and predictive analytics process.The interoperability feature sets BigQuery apart from other data warehouses. This feature can help data teams analyze data faster, as it allows them to seamlessly connect and exchange information with various types of services.For example, the platform uses BigQuery Storage API, which provides a simpler architecture that requires less data movement, removing the need to have multiple copies of the same information stored in different places. There is also BigQuery Omni, a fully managed enterprise data warehouse that integrates Google Cloud solutions with other cloud services such as Azure and Amazon Web Services, which allows companies to perform analysis without moving the data from other cloud platforms to the Google Cloud platform.The BigQuery Migration Service and Management feature targets data engineers who are new to BigQuery. This solution can help users migrate data quickly, affordably, and with low risk, so they can immediately modernize data as needed.For those who are already using BigQuery, the BigQuery Administration feature helps users monitor resource usage in real-time.According to Google, BigQuery Storage API’s real-time process analytics capabilities are continuously improved to help users get faster results. As for predictive analytics, Google Cloud’s Explainable AI service can clarify how each feature contributes to the prediction results and helps identify biases in the model.Vertex AI upgradesPhoto credit: PexelsVertex AI is designed specifically for developers and brings Google’s machine learning tools together on one platform. This makes the experimentation and deployment process faster while simplifying AI model management.Since its launch in May 2021, Vertex AI has seen adoption rise consistently. It has witnessed a threefold increase in total API requests, a 70% rise in total training volume, and an increase in total prediction volume by 2x.Three features of the service were highlighted at the 2021 Google Next event, namely Vertex AI Metadata, Vertex AI Pipeline, and Vertex AI Neural Architecture Search (NAS).Vertex AI Metadata makes it easier to audit and manage the machine learning model workflows that are under development and automatically tracks inputs and outputs to all components.When a machine learning model is in production, input data can sometimes deviate from what a model is trained on, which causes the model to deteriorate. Vertex AI’s Model Monitoring feature reviews the model and warns developers of deviant signals, diagnoses the cause of deviations, and triggers retraining paths or collects relevant training data.The Vertex AI Pipeline, on the other hand, helps automate, monitor, and manage machine learning systems by setting up serverless workflows and storing workflow outputs – often called artifacts – using Vertex AI Metadata. This way, users can analyze workflow artifacts such as machine learning model pedigrees, which may include training data, hyperparameters, and the code used to build the model.Meanwhile, Vertex AI NAS can optimize neural networks, enabling machine learning experts to perform complex tasks with higher accuracy, lower latency, and lower power requirements without human intervention.The recently launched Vertex AI Workbench, which is now under public review, is another addition to the Vertex AI service. It is an AI development environment for data scientists that helps them increase the speed of distribution of machine learning models.With this service, data practitioners can analyze all their data in BigQuery with a single interface, letting them build and test machine learning models 5x faster than on a regular laptop.Data in decision makingThe saying that data is the new oil in the digital era is not an exaggeration. Like oil, raw and unstructured data has no value. Its value will only be seen when the data is collected thoroughly, connected to other relevant information, and analyzed properly at the right time.If companies can learn and know how to collect data appropriately, the information can play an important role in directing their business development efforts.Google Cloud’s mission is to enable organizations around the world to transform their businesses using digital technologies, offering the best infrastructure, digital transformation platforms, and services tailored to their respective industries.To find out more, join Best of Next: Asia Pacific, which features the hottest cloud topics highlighted at Google Cloud Next ‘21.

We break down the big and messy topics of Asia’s tech and startup community. Get the newsletter in your inbox everyday with a Premium subscription.Hello reader,When I was still in school, some of my more financially savvy friends urged me to invest my money instead of leaving it in a bank account. Knowing that I was essentially living from allowance to allowance, my friends suggested that I “start small” as it was more important to begin early. Alas, I did not follow through on their advice because I was too lazy to do research and my finances were stretched too thinly.However, that’s not a mistake most businesses will make (hopefully). Even if the amount is small, backing the right ventures can often lead to outstanding rewards. In today’s story, we discuss how Modalku and Carro are doing just that with their investment in Jakarta-based Bank Index.Today we look at:Modalku and Carro’s “small minority stake” in Bank IndexAn injection of capital for a climate-focused VC fundOther newsy highlights such as Yield Guild Games’ asset growth and Grab’s new home clearing services in SingaporePremium summaryBanking on Bank IndexImage credit: Timmy LoenIndonesia-based Modalku and used-car platform Carro have acquired a “small minority stake” in Jakarta-based Bank Index, multiple sources confirmed to Tech in Asia. The move comes shortly after Modalku – a digital financing platform for MSMEs – and its Singapore counterpart Funding Societies raised US$144 million in series C funding led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2.Moving into digital: The two tech startups seem to share digital banking ambitions. Modalku CEO Reynold Wijaya said that the company plans to use part of its series C funding for its neobank plans, while Carro recently invested in Indonesia’s Bank Allo.Shared backing: Modalku and Carro also have another thing in common: counting Alpha JWC Ventures as a major investor. This link provides a possible explanation for their interest in Bank Index: Eko Kurniadi, a partner at the VC firm, was previously the vice president of investment at private equity company Creador Capital, which in turn owns about 20% of Bank Index. However, it remains unclear whether Alpha JWC Ventures was involved in this deal.In good company: The investment puts Modalku and Carro in the company of Kazanah Indexindo, Bank Index’s majority owner. The nearly 30-year-old bank reported 367 billion rupiah (US$255.6 million) in revenue and 90 billion rupiah (US$6.3 million) in profits for 2018.Read more: Exclusive: Modalku, Carro invest in Indonesia’s Bank Index, sources sayStartup spotlightA breath of fresh AeraSingapore-based Aera VC is looking to stem the tide of worsening environmental conditions by funding startups that focus on climate-related innovations. Founded in 2016 by Derek Handley and Nick Winstone, the firm recently raised US$30 million for a new fund dedicated to this reason.From east to west: Aera VC currently has several firms in its investment portfolio, including US chemical tech company Solugen as well as Singapore’s Shiok Meats and Australia-based Fabled Food, which both specialize in alternative meats. “Our long-term vision is about investing across the sustainability spectrum by backing breakthrough technologies that reverse climate change, whether they spawn from blockchain innovations or through scientific discoveries,” said Handley.The path ahead: Using this new fund, Aera VC plans to make investments in 30 seed and follow-on rounds over the next two years, with subscriptions from institutional investors still open for up to US$100 million this year.Aera Force One: It has also launched an investment DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) called Aera Force. The DAO currently holds 2,000 ether or ETH (about US$6 million) to be used for blockchain-powered climate and carbon solutions. Investors looking to contribute to the DAO can do so by purchasing investment tickets worth 10 ETH (about US$27,000), which are represented as NFTs designed by artist Kenneth Alexander.Quick bytes1️⃣ Doctor’s ordersMediBuddy, an India-based healthcare startup, has raised US$125 million in a series C funding round, pushing its total raised funding to US$170 million. The platform offers round-the-clock access to specialist doctors via video calls, doorstep medicine delivery, at-home lab tests, mental health support, and other integrated healthcare services. MediBuddy plans to use the fresh funds to strengthen its tech and to further invest in customer awareness and hiring.2️⃣ A bountiful harvestPhilippines-based Yield Guild Games (YGG) has grown its Axie Infinity assets by 15x to reach US$25.5 million as of the fourth quarter of 2021. Much of this was generated through earnings from SLP (or small love potion, Axie Infinity‘s in-game digital currency), YGG scholars (players who borrow axies to join the game), and the firm’s community managers. YGG’s assets in other games such as Star Atlas, Monkey League, and Illuvium also saw strong growth, hitting US$10 million, US$8.2 million, and US$6.6 million, respectively.3️⃣ A win for halal investingUzbekistan-based Iman has raised US$1 million as part of its seed round. Founded by Rustam Rahmatov and Mark Zubov in 2019, the investment platform’s Islamic finance operations has been certified as Sharia-compliant. Iman will use these seed funds to integrate retail partners, partner with merchants, and expand in its market, said Rahmatov.4️⃣ Grab a bucket and a mopWant to get your house all spick and span?

Delivered every Thursday via email and through the Tech in Asia website, this free newsletter breaks down the biggest stories and trends in ecommerce. If you’re not a subscriber, get access by registering here.Hi there,In ecommerce, fulfillment makes all the difference. Customers stick around when deliveries are quicker, and 50% of them don’t return if the delivery experience is subpar.Yet, fulfillment costs make up an nearly 70% of a typical ecommerce order on average. Throw in sophisticated storage infrastructure and complex logistic networks, and the price of fulfillment could skyrocket.That hasn’t fazed players in Indonesia’s burgeoning e-fulfillment industry, though. From ecommerce heavyweights like Tokopedia and Bukalapak to industry outsiders, everyone wants to have skin in the game.Still, e-fulfillment can be a cutthroat game. In this week’s Big Story, my colleague, Jofie Yordan, highlights Indonesia’s booming e-fulfilment industry and digs into what it takes to thrive in it.Our Hot Take this week takes a look at Dmonstudio’s sudden closure and what it means for ByteDance. Rather than being a setback, it’s another step forward in the Chinese tech giant’s ecommerce experiment.— Tian WenTHE BIG STORYIn Indonesia, a rising niche in ecommerce: e-fulfilmentImage credit: Timmy LoenWhile the ecommerce marketplaces offer these services in-house, a rising crop of third-party players are coming up.THE HOT TAKEWhy ByteDance shut down its Shein cloneImage credit: GearriceHere’s what happened:Dmonstudio, the fast-fashion platform reportedly launched by TikTok to take on industry titan Shein, ceased operations abruptly on February 11.While both Dmonstudio and ByteDance have not commented on the sudden closure, industry observers suggest that weak user adoption and supply chain inefficiencies were to blame.Rather than sounding the death knell for ByteDance’s ecommerce ambitions, Dmonstudio’s closure hints at a maturing strategy that’s still taking shape.Here’s our take:When news of Dmonstudio’s launch first broke, it had all the signs of an epic showdown in the making.Reportedly helmed by Kang Zeyu, ByteDance’s head of ecommerce, Dmonstudio was billed as an “S-level” project with the potential to topple Shein’s dominance in fast fashion. According to Pandaily, ByteDance-backed firm poached nearly 100 people from Shein to kick-start its operations.However, this clash of titans never came to be. Dmonstudio fizzled out after just 101 days in operation and abruptly shut shop on February 11.What went wrong? Both ByteDance and Dmonstudio are still keeping mum, but industry observers Tech in Asia spoke with suggested that weak user adoption was to blame. Data from Chinese ecommerce information platform Ebrun indicates that Dmonstudio saw only 8,000 daily visitors and 16,400 daily web page views before it closed its doors.There’s also another reason for ByteDance’s “rapid retreat.” While the tech titan could easily emulate Shein’s online user experience and rapidly build a founding team by dangling generous salary packages, it will likely struggle with replicating the supply chain that makes Shein a fast-fashion powerhouse.It’s plausible that ByteDance could acquire logistics players if it can’t stomach the do-it-yourself approach. The company recently invested in iMile Delivery LLC, a Dubai-based logistics chain startup.Even then, building a network of warehouses and in-housing logistics also goes against the grain of ByteDance’s ecommerce pursuits. To date, the company has only dabbled in platform- and app-driven plays.Dubbing it a “retreat while the going’s still good,” Jingzhe Research’s Bai Lu claims that ByteDance had figured out how to bring in steady traffic but not how to rapidly scale up supply chain systems. He adds that it “makes sense” for ByteDance to abandon Dmonstudio and focus on other asset-light ecommerce pursuits like Douyin Box and the newly launched Fanno ecommerce app instead.If that’s the case, why did Dmonstudio emulate Shein in the first place? Did it take cues from fast fashion’s greatest just to hit a brick wall it knew it would come up against?Maybe that’s the point. Rather than being a Shein killer, Dmonstudio is simply ByteDance’s latest experiment as the tech giant looks to refine its ecommerce strategy:In 2014, ByteDance launched “daily special promotions” on its news app Toutiao to lukewarm response.In 2016, it buddied up with Chinese ecommerce major JD.com to drive conversion traffic to the latter.In 2017, Toutiao launched Fang Xing Gou, a short-lived ecommerce platform that operated within the Toutiao app.In 2018, ByteDance tested the ecommerce waters with ZhiDian, an independent ecommerce app that sold high-quality consumer goods at affordable prices.In 2019, ByteDance-owned Douyin introduced ecommerce mini-applications and made the product window feature available to all users.In mid-December last year, Douyin Box, a Dewu-Xiaohongshu hybrid, was launched on Android and iOS. It allows users to shop, recommend, and search for products on Douyin.Another sign that Dmonstudio was intended as just a brief experiment for ByteDance: Company insiders revealed that job offers were still being sent out under the company’s name even after it shut down, according to Jingzhe Research’s Bai Lu.ByteDance is feeling its way across the ecommerce river, and Dmonstudio marks just another step that will help the Chinese tech behemoth define its ecommerce strategy.— Tian WenNEWS YOU SHOULD KNOWCheck out Tech in Asia’s coverage of the ecommerce scene here.1️⃣ Tencent-owned WeChat and Alibaba’s AliExpress have been placed under the US government’s “notorious markets” list for copyright privacy.

It bolstered its super app but still kept a few fingers in the airline and logistics businesses.Meanwhile, MyTukar underwent a reorganization and looked to grow its market share soon after sealing a US$30 million investment from Carro in 2019.But, along with the change in name and strategic shifts, came major rejigging in the leadership of each company.Tech in Asia has found that about 13 junior and senior executives from AirAsia’s marketing and tech divisions, as well as 12 junior and senior staff from MyTukar’s business development division, left to join Carsome in 2021.While such corporate moves are commonplace, a former AirAsia employee with knowledge of the matter says the episode was unique as many who left the airline claimed to have been poached to beef up Carsome’s digital marketing and tech units.See also: Carsome and Carro: A neck-and-neck race to transform how people buy carsThe resignations have irked AirAsia co-founder and CEO Tony Fernandes, who in a February 3 LinkedIn post, took a swipe at his former colleagues, saying they “have never quite performed well in their new companies.”While he did not explicitly mention Carsome, Fernandes also hit out at “new digital unicorns who actually have not achieved much” for poaching ex-AirAsia staff.Carsome is said to be Malaysia’s first tech unicorn following its share-swap deal with internet investment firm Catcha in 2021.“It takes a lot more than one person and that [is] the beauty and as people leave we replace them with better people,” Fernandes wrote in the post.Capital A declined to comment on the staff departures and on Fernandes’ LinkedIn post.However, the CEO recently edited his post, clarifying that the statement didn’t “apply to all” and that his point was that it had always been “about the team not the individual.”Insiders familiar with the matter also tell Tech in Asia that they knew that Carsome had made offers to a number of MyTukar’s staff across different divisions.Tech in Asia has seen offer letters dated June 2021 to select MyTukar employees from Carsome.

Carousell declined to comment on rumors or speculations on its listing plans.(From left) Carousell co-founders Quek Siu Rui, Marcus Tan, and Lucas Ngoo / Photo credit: CarousellIn 2020, the online classifieds giant reported a revenue of US$40.6 million, a more than 3x increase from 2019. Its acquisition of 701Search – the Telenor-owned marketplace behind Mudah in Malaysia, Cho Tot in Vietnam, and OneKyat in Myanmar – likely drove a bulk of that growth.At the same time, Carousell’s losses before taxes deepened from US$42.2 million to US$63.9 million as its employee headcount ballooned. Economic uncertainty due to the Covid-19 pandemic also weighed on its performance in markets like Myanmar, leading to impairment losses.That said, a large chunk of its losses are non-cash-based. Its net cash flow from operating activities actually improved by US$10 million to negative US$32.3 million.Carousell acquired 701 Group in November 2019. If we consider the full impact of 701 Group’s full revenue for that year – US$22.1 million – Carousell would have reported a revenue of US$37.8 million in 2019 on a group level. On this basis, Carousell’s revenue grew by 7% between 2019 and 2020.See also: Unpacking Carousell’s 2019 financial numbersAccording to the classifieds giant, its performance varied from market to market, depending on how strict lockdowns were.“We saw some markets grow rapidly with double and triple digit growth rates, while some markets were more impacted due to strict lockdowns that prevented businesses from operating,” a spokesperson tells Tech in Asia.Growth by acquisition has its costsAside from 701 Group’s significant revenue contribution, Carousell is increasingly feeling the weight of running a sprawling business stretching across entities.These include online automotive platform OneShift and sneaker marketplace Ox Street, which Carousell acquired in 2018 and 2021, respectively. There’s also Ox Luxe, a buying, selling, and consignment marketplace for pre-owned luxury goods, which spun out of the group at the end of last year.Between 2019 and 2020, the firm’s employee benefits expenses roughly doubled to US$62.6 million. This was partly driven by a significant increase in non-cash share-based payments, which grew 8x to US$25.6 million. The firm also saw an increase in expenses on salaries, commissions, and bonuses, growing over 40% to US$32.4 million in the same period.According to Carousell, the rise in share-based payments was due to a combination of a higher fair valuation of its employee stock option plan and “refresher grants” made to its team.In 2020, a liquidity event – the first of its kind for Carousell – saw the firm’s employees cash out “a few million dollars” as part of its ESOP buyback program, a company spokesperson told Tech in Asia previously. The group repurchased in cash over 230,000 share options worth US$12.04 each, amounting to US$2.8 million.See also: Carousell’s early investors, employees cash out with big returnsWhile acquisitions have been a quick way for Carousell to grow its top line, it also means rapidly increasing costs.Carousell now has 800 employees across its various businesses, of which about 100 were added over the course of 2021 – the year it acquired Ox Street. As such, employee benefits expenses are expected to continue rising in its 2021 financial year.Ox Street CEO Gijs Verheijke (left) and Carousell Group CEO Quek Siu Rui / Photo credit: CarousellSee also: Unpacking Carousell’s next big move: recommerceThe firm will also see rising expenses as it charges ahead with its acquisition spree. Carousell is reportedly in talks with 99 Group in a deal that could bolster its own real estate offering.Should the deal push through, 99 Group will add 350 employees to Carousell’s headcount, which come from the former’s property portals in Singapore and Indonesia as well as its data service providers Singapore Real Estate Exchange and Rumah123. The property startup has been reporting net losses prior to 2020 even as its revenue grew.Asked if its rapidly rising headcount may indicate future redundancies, a Carousell spokesperson hints at upcoming plans around creating value for buyers and sellers who are “time-starved and wary of transacting online.”“These initiatives require investment in good talent, and in fact we are looking at growing our headcount,” the spokesperson says.See also: Carousell in talks for $150m acquisition of 99 GroupThis, however, does not eliminate the possibility that Carousell might make layoffs in some departments and hire in others in the future.Analysts continue to keenly watch the classifieds giant’s traction in high-ticket categories like cars and property.“In these categories, there are more professional sellers like property agents, developers and dealerships, who are willing to pay for the service,” Kristine Lau, an associate at global research firm Third Bridge, told The Business Times last September.As of April last year, Carousell’s autos vertical accounted for a third of the Group’s revenue, which made it the largest contributor to its top line.This continues to be the case. A spokesperson adds that the vertical is seeing “rapid growth” in Singapore and Hong Kong, and that its auto brands have market-leading positions in Malaysia, Vietnam, and the Philippines.However, not all of Carousell’s acquired marketplaces have performed to par.In 2020, the company noted an impairment loss of US$7.8 million for the disposal of OneKyat, its classifieds marketplace in Myanmar, citing the “overall decline in the marketplace activities” and “ongoing economic uncertainty as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.”A Carousell spokesperson says the firm remains committed to growing OneKyat and supporting its teammates on the ground in Myanmar, and that the impairment was “a non-cash accounting adjustment that appropriately reflects the ongoing economic uncertainty” in the country.More benefits to be realizedOn the bright side, as a heavyweight in the secondhand goods space across Southeast Asia, Carousell stands to benefit from a trend toward “recommerce” – or reverse commerce.The revenue potential of the firm’s recent acquisitions have also not yet been reflected in its financial statements. Its acquisition of Ox Street, for instance, is likely to open up revenue streams from value-added services like authentication, refurbishing, shipping, and payments, in addition to fees that Carousell earns from promotion tools and business accounts.As Carousell expands its recently-launched ad services platform Connect, which offers brands a full-funnel marketing solution across its platform and third-party sites, revenue from direct media sales can also be expected to take up a larger share of the pie.",The Singapore-headquartered classifieds giant could list in the US through a SPAC merger as soon as this quarter.,300605,Melissa Goh,True,Terence Lee and Lorenzo Kyle Subido,1,"['Analysis', 'Ecommerce', 'Premium Content']","['701 Group', '701search', 'car classifieds', 'car marketplace', 'Carousell', 'classifieds', 'Connect', 'Ecommerce', 'ecommerce marketplace', 'online property classifieds', 'ox street', 'recommerce', 'reverse commerce', 'Singapore', 'Southeast Asia', 'SPAC', 'unicorn']",False,,True,True,True,False,5

734197,2022-02-24T01:55:58,2022-02-24T01:52:57,"In Indonesia, e-fulfillment rises as an ecommerce niche",indonesia-efulfillment-rises-ecommerce-niche,post,"For Indonesia’s major ecommerce marketplaces, one service that has become a fixture on their platforms is e-fulfillment. Tokopedia, Shopee, and Bukalapak all have this feature, which lets sellers hand over their warehousing and related services – such as packing and shipping – to the ecommerce platforms.This is perhaps a natural development in Indonesia, where the geographical size and quality of infrastructure vary greatly between cities.If Amazon is anything to go by, e-fulfillment holds plenty of promise: The US ecommerce giant’s Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) service counts 85% of the firm’s top 10,000 global sellers as users, and it has also powered Amazon’s marketplace revenues over the years.That said, several rising startups are also eyeing this space, offering a third-party, platform-agnostic option for ecommerce sellers. While many of these startups are already ecommerce enablers or logistics players, some are entering the space from seemingly unrelated industries.A Shipper warehouse / Photo credit: ShipperStill, e-fulfillment is not necessarily the easiest space to enter. The warehousing part of the equation, for instance, is particularly capital-intensive. Meanwhile, margins are thin.“Profitability may be difficult if you run it as a standalone business,” says a logistics CEO who declined to be named in this report.A road to scaleBroadly speaking, e-fulfillment providers offer warehousing services in the form of the warehouse space and workers needed. Tokopedia’s fulfillment platform TokoCabang, for instance, takes care of everything from storing inventory all the way to packing orders and shipping them to customers via last-mile partners.What’s even more attractive, however, may be location: Most players have a network of warehouses spread across the country, including lower-tier cities. Riady Kurniawan, founder of direct-to-consumer makeup brand Goban Cosmetics, says that leveraging e-fulfillment would easily let ecommerce sellers like him expand into other areas without incurring too much costs.Fulfillment models in Indonesia / Photo credit: Rizqi MaulanaWhile online marketplaces are perhaps the pioneers in this space – Tokopedia launched its e-fulfillment service in 2019, with Shopee and Bukalapak following suit a year later – there appears to be room for third-party players. Like many others, Indonesian ecommerce sellers often do business on several marketplaces.“The majority of marketplace warehousing fulfillment services are exclusive only to sellers on their platform,” says Budi Handoko, the co-founder and CEO of logistics firm Shipper. “This is where we can become a non-biased service provider.”Marketplaces also typically have additional requirements that sellers must meet – like a special membership or a minimum daily transaction amount – before they can use the platform’s fulfillment services. Third-party players are usually more flexible.For the likes of Shipper, e-fulfillment is a logical evolution of its existing strategy. The Y Combinator alum, which raised US$63 million last year in a series B round led by DST Global and Sequoia India, started as an aggregator for logistics services.Another player, East Ventures-backed Sirclo, started as a software-as-a-service platform that helps MSMEs create Shopify-like online storefronts. It now offers e-fulfillment services through its ecommerce enabler business, Sirclo Commerce, which was launched in 2017.But this space has also attracted those who previously had little to do with ecommerce or logistics. Kioson, a startup that lets individuals and small businesses sell digital products like phone credits, announced a plan in November 2021 to operate more than 100 new warehouses in East Java through a subsidiary called Gudang Pintar (which means “smart warehouse”).Image credit: Timmy LoenIndeed, the anonymous logistics CEO we cited earlier says that even with large volumes, e-fulfillment margins are “very thin.” It is thus more sustainable if a company offers a wider array of services rather than e-fulfillment on its own.“Fulfillment tends to be the cost center for ecommerce platforms or even retailers themselves,” he says. “Last-mile logistics players or ecommerce enablers would have the best positions here since they can subsidize the costs from their other business lines.”Otherwise, he adds, any extra fees will ultimately have to be shouldered by the usual suspects: the customers themselves.Deep pockets neededA large part behind the thin margins of e-fulfillment businesses is the relatively sizable setup costs. The founder of an e-fulfillment firm who declined to be named says that he had to shell out at least 9 billion rupiah (US$628,300) to start operating a warehouse unit in the Greater Jakarta area.The amount covered the cost of renting a large 5,000-square-meter warehouse in a strategic area near Jakarta, with a rental fee of 3 billion rupiah (US$209,414) per year. The remaining capital was used for operations, including payment for a warehouse management system software license, as well as fees for electricity, security, staff, and other requirements.“With such a large amount of capital, fulfillment players need to calculate a cost-to-serve approach in every warehouse they own so that operations are truly efficient. The goal should at least be that the entire business can accommodate tens of thousands of orders per day [from various warehouses],” the founder explains.One of the TokoCabang warehouses / Photo credit: TokopediaTo pursue such a target, several players have expanded their warehouses to different areas, even reaching several cities outside the Java island. They either build the warehouses on their own or partner with startups and big property players.For instance, Shipper – which claims to have managed more than 300 warehouses as of November 2021 – partnered with Metrolink, one of Indonesia’s largest warehouse facilities. Other e-fulfillment services, such as those run by Shopee and Lazada, also rent Metrolink warehouses.According to a 2018 report, the contract value for the construction of one Metrolink warehousing facility is 1 trillion rupiah (US$69 million).Meanwhile, smaller warehouses from other players can go for 1.2 billion rupiah (US$83,803) a year to US$4.5 billion rupiah (US$314,339) a year for a 6,000-square-meter space.For Kurniawan, the founder of Goban Cosmetics, the current pricing is relatively expensive, but he says at least Indonesian sellers still have an array of options.Amazon, on the other hand, has been so dominant in several countries that FBA has been criticized for alleged antitrust violations.To be clear, FBA is not mandatory for Amazon sellers, but signing up for the service would make it easier to get Prime status (along with the visibility and sales that come with it). Other sellers, some say, sign up for FBA even if it ends up being more expensive than shipping the products themselves.The allegations against the ecommerce titan have led to a US$1.3 billion fine in Italy, as well as investigations in the European Union and India. Amazon, however, maintained that sellers wouldn’t use FBA if it didn’t provide value.A version of this story was originally published by Rizqi Maulana on Tech in Asia Indonesia.Currency converted from Indonesian rupiah to US dollar: US$1 = 14,316 rupiah.","While ecommerce marketplaces in Indonesia already offer e-fulfillment as an in-house service, a rising crop of third-party players look to stir the pot.",558171,Jofie Yordan,True,Putra Muskita and Jaclyn Tiu,0,"['Analysis', 'Ecommerce', 'Premium Content']","['e-fulfillment', 'Ecommerce', 'fulfillment', 'Indonesia', 'logistics', 'Tokopedia', 'Warehousing']",False,,True,True,True,False,5

The round also saw participation from some angel investors.Founded in 2019 by Joshi, Arijit Gupta, and Karan Gupta, the startup is building an Oyo-like model for hospitals in India.The trio had earlier established Zefo, an online marketplace that specializes in selling refurbished TVs, mobile phones, and furniture. In April 2019, they sold the firm to Quikr in a US$26.7 million all-stock deal.Building the Oyo of hospitalsAfter the Zefo acquisition deal was wrapped up, Karan decided to go back to his hometown and help his parents – both doctors – to scale their 100-bed hospital in Panchkula, a town in the Indian state of Haryana. The hospital was not giving the returns that Karan’s family expected.After discussing the matter with his fellow Zefo founders, they soon realized the white space in the healthcare market. “While technology and the internet have fundamentally transformed commerce, entertainment, and education in the past 10 years, the experience of going to a hospital largely remains the same,” says Joshi. The biggest intervention has happened around doctor consultations, he added.With these insights, they decided to look deeper into the hospital sector. While India has more than 69,000 hospitals, they noted there are just around 10 branded hospital chains such as Apollo, Manipal Health, and Fortis.Ayu Health co-founders (from left) Karan Gupta, Himesh Joshi and Arijit Gupta / Photo credit: Ayu HealthThe co-founders realized that several of the standalone hospitals have good infrastructure and protocols in place as well as trained staff. However, they couldn’t differentiate themselves from others or create their own brand, so most of these hospitals run only at 30% to 40% utilization, noted Joshi.These findings led to the birth of Ayu Health in October 2019. Once a hospital comes under the Ayu network, the startup uses digital channels to market them, creates a centralized operating system for the hospitals’ use, and digitizes the processing of health insurance.For a more transparent offering, Ayu Health also formulates standardized price packages for several procedures, irrespective of the number of days or number of consultations a patient has to take. Doctors take care of the clinical part of the procedure, while Ayu Health accounts for the operation side.More hospitals to join the networkAyu Health has 40 hospitals in its network, mostly located in the cities of Chandigarh and Bengaluru. The startup is in expansion mode and will be entering cities like Delhi-NCR, Hyderabad, and Chennai in 2022. It plans to grow the number of hospitals in its network by 10x by the end of the year, Joshi told Tech in Asia.Earlier this month, it acquired SwasthyaSewak Network Of Hospitals in Jaipur, which will bring 16 more hospitals into Ayu Health’s network.See also: These are the most active investors in India’s startupsThe company also places an Ayu Mitra – a counselor who speaks to patients and navigates their overall experience – in every hospital under its banner. “This is the only human intervention that we have at the hospital level. Everything else is digital,” said Joshi. There are currently 60 Ayu Mitras across the network, with 50 to 60 more to be hired this year.Ayu Health also plans to partner with diagnostic centers so that hospitals that don’t have such services won’t lose out on patients.Since the company uses an asset-light model and is not involved in building the hospitals, the team hopes that Ayu Health can become the largest network of branded hospitals in India.","Built on an asset-light model, Ayu Health aims to use technology to create the largest chain of branded hospitals in India.",589814,Samreen Ahmad,True,Collin Furtado and Lorenzo Kyle Subido,0,"['Investments', 'Premium Content', 'Startups']","['Ayu Health', 'branded hopsitals', 'Funding', 'healthcare', 'healthtech', 'India', 'series b', 'startups', 'zefo']",False,,True,True,True,False,3

Get the newsletter in your inbox everyday with a Premium subscription.Hello reader,When listicles titled “11 sinking cities around the world” or “5 cities that will be drowned” start popping up more frequently on social media and news portals, something isn’t right. The world is sinking, and our maps are likely to be redrawn by global warming in the not-so-distant future. This is an unavoidable reality that puts millions of lives at risk.The usual suspects of rapid urbanization, rising sea levels, and land subsidence have all contributed to this climate crisis. It has already left a marked impact on one of the largest Southeast Asian markets: Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia and home to more than 10 million people, has the unfortunate label of “the fastest sinking city in the world.”Almost half of Jakarta sits below sea level, and some researchers believe that if the capital’s issues related to rising sea levels continue to go unchecked, parts of the city will be entirely submerged by 2050. Jakarta’s problem is so dire that the Indonesian government passed a bill to move its capital from Jakarta to East Kalimantan on Borneo island.The unprecedented move is one of the first capital relocations to be driven by environmental forces and it is unlikely to be the last, as Tokyo, Ho Chi Minh City and Bangkok all stare at a similar threat.Startups and governments are taking note of this problem and are now scampering to find viable solutions. In our premium story pick today, we analyze the feasibility, potential, and challenges that face a startup pitching floating houses and infrastructure as the answer to a global conundrum.Today we look at:FlexBase’s solution for a global crisisAn AI-driven proptech platform’s US$35 million funding roundOther newsy highlights such as Axie’s US$4 billion milestone, and the largest VC fund founded by Vietnamese investorsAlso, if you’re an entrepreneur looking for funding, fill out this form to get your company featured on our list of fundraising startups.Premium summaryRiding the rising tideImage credit: Timmy Loen“Why not just build on top of the water?” Shiwen Yap, co-founder of FlexBase International, told Tech in Asia. This is FlexBase’s straightforward solution to the complex question of how to save the world’s coastal cities.The Netherlands-based firm is bringing its expertise in constructing floating buildings to Southeast Asia. The company told Tech in Asia that it will start its expansion into the region by investing US$1 million to set up its international office in Singapore and plans to hire for five key functions locally. For now, FlexBase will focus on Thailand and Vietnam.Floating clean energy: In Southeast Asia, the firm will focus on entering the hospitality, agriculture, aquaculture, and energy spaces. Besides building floating hotels and farms, its system can carry solar panels and turbines. The global market for floating power plants alone is expected to breach US$2.4 billion by 2028.Cultural hurdles: FlexBase has previously built floating houses in Bangladesh and the Philippines – two flood-prone countries. However, its houses are not seeing much demand in those areas. “Living on water is socially unacceptable, and in general, people are afraid of water and therefore don’t feel safe. We see these issues in the whole ASEAN region,” says FlexBase founder Jan Willem Roel.Work in progress: In Singapore, FlexBase is preparing to build two floating projects, which it says will involve private as well as public groups. These initiatives include a 50,000 square meter sports facility and a food court complex. The company is also partnering with the National University of Singapore to build a study location on a floating vertical farm concept.Read more: Dutch startup plans to keep Southeast Asia afloat – literallyStartup spotlightProps for proptechFacilio, an AI-driven proptech platform, has raised US$35 million in a series B funding round led by Dragoneer Investment Group.

Its solutions are used across commercial office buildings, retail chains, hospital systems, and school campuses, among other places.Worldwide demand: Facilio currently has more than 40 clients across India, the Middle East, the US, Europe, the UK, Singapore, Australia, and Brazil. These customers are large enterprises that own at least 5 million square feet of real estate. Co-founder Prabhu Ramachandran said that Brookfield, which also participated in the funding round, is one of its clients.Beating pandemic blues: There was a brief lull when the Covid-19 global health crisis broke out, but Ramachandran said business has since picked up. While he didn’t disclose the company’s financials, he said the firm clocked a 4x year-over-year revenue growth in 2021. He expects the firm will continue this growth in 2022 as well. “We should be able to break even sometime next year,” he added.Fresh funds, new targets: Ramachandran told Tech in Asia that Facilio wants to tap into the smart building software-as-a-service market, which is projected to hit US$265.4 billion by 2028. Facilio plans to use the fresh capital to expand its local teams – especially in verticals such as sales, pre-sales, and customer support – and aims to increase its headcount from 125 to 200 people by the end of 2022.Quick bytes1️⃣ Another feather in Axie’s capBlockchain game Axie Infinity has become the first NFT series to cross US$4 billion in sales.

733631,2022-02-23T08:00:11,2022-02-22T02:07:22,The value of cross-border payments for Asia’s fintech firms,crossborder-payments-asias-fintech-firms,post,"When Covid-19 hit the globe, three things happened: consumer behaviors evolved, trade increased with emerging markets, and digitalization was supercharged. The payments industry was quick to step up to respond to consumer challenges, which led to the increased acceptance of digital payment platforms today.“As many struggled economically, faster settlement times, customer-fee waivers, and short-term funding support was offered by financial institutions to lighten consumers’ economic load,” recalls Rohit Narang, managing director for Asia Pacific of cross-border payments platform Currencycloud. “Players in the space also rolled out educational resources and initiatives to help users cope with the newfound disruption.”Governments similarly offered support by waiving or reducing certain payment charges, increasing digital transaction limits, and providing funds to support the digital transformation of SMEs. Amid the pandemic, the use of contactless payments across emerging Asia has increased by 60% – double the initial estimate. By 2023, Asia’s payments sector is expected to exceed US$1 trillion in annual revenue.Rohit Narang, managing director for Asia Pacific at Currencycloud / Photo credit: CurrencycloudHowever, gaps still remain in Asia’s payment ecosystem. While domestic payment options are strong, international transfers need improving.International payments fall short in AsiaWith existing cross-border payment options, consumers experience a lack of transparency, delays in payment processing, inconsistent service availability, and convoluted regulations, according to Narang.Payment systems across the world have differing standards, systems, and regulations. These differences have caused bumps in the process, preventing seamless data exchange between customers, providers, and their stakeholders.“If multiple intermediaries are involved, cross-border payments can take up to three days to process, and even longer for less-developed markets,” says Narang.Bank penetration in emerging Asian countries also remains low. Over half of Asia’s population is unbanked while 18% are underbanked, and many don’t have access to cross-border payments at all. As banks abandon corridors, customers are left with a smaller – and more expensive – pool of options to send or receive money overseas.Cross-border payments also face the issue of limited coverage.“Despite SWIFT boasting connectivity to more than 200 markets, this doesn’t guarantee banks’ blanket connectivity as a bank’s coverage is dependent on the size of their own correspondent banking network,” explains Narang. He is referring to the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications, the most popular global messaging system used by banks and financial institutions to manage cross-border transactions.To address these gaps, consumers have taken to carrying physical cash. However, one can only carry so much cash into each country, and it comes with several security issues.Wire transfers, done through regulated institutions such as banks or remittance companies, are a reliable option. However, these also lack transparency and can be expensive.This leaves consumers with unregulated, informal brokerage networks.“The danger of using these brokerage networks is that costs may be high, and since operations are typically based on trust, the risk of losing the money still stands,” points out Narang, “There is also no transparency in where the money is when moving across borders and how long it may take to reach the recipient.”Keeping up with cross-border paymentsThe pandemic accelerated payment trends that were already in motion. In particular, Southeast Asia saw a rise in investments in the e-payments space. Contactless payment methods such as QR codes and digital wallets are also now commonplace – in Singapore, for instance, meals at hawker centers can be paid for using such options.Photo credit: coffeemate / 123RFAgreements such as the ASEAN Cross-Border Payments Interoperability Network initiative were launched to encourage member countries to draw up bilateral arrangements for real-time payments across Southeast Asia. These agreements not only influence digital payment adoption and financial inclusion, but also open up opportunities for fintech businesses in the region.For one, they allow intra-Asia flows, which can improve the overall efficiency and interoperability of cross-border digital payment systems. Further innovation, partnerships, and collaboration between payment providers and businesses are also made easier.“Digital acceptance and transformation from industries such as logistics and healthcare are making these sectors appear modern and desirable to young job seekers,” says Narang, “This ultimately impacts the economy and increases prospects for payment providers and the greater industry.”For businesses looking to dabble into the payments space, there are a couple of hurdles they must anticipate. For one, navigating the regulatory landscape can be challenging as each region maintains different infrastructures and network interoperability.Amid these constantly evolving regulations and requirements, the importance of a secure and efficient payment process is evident. The Currencycloud Spark solution aims to automate this process, securing payment instructions from the get-go to avoid returns, delays, and extra costs. This allows users to access a multi-currency wallet that supports 38 currencies.Additionally, Currencycloud’s SWIFT global payment innovation lets businesses track where their money is throughout the transfer process.The future of international money transferThis year, global cross-border payments are expected to reach US$156 trillion. According to Currencycloud, it’s likely that further integration of digital payments across the value chain will occur.Through partnerships, players in the industry will ensure value-added services for customers. Bilateral real-time payment arrangements are also set to create regional payments infrastructure that will connect the payment systems of different markets.Photo credit: koonsiri / 123RF“It is an exciting time for cross-border payments,” says Narang, “Businesses should embrace digital transformation, understand deeply what needs to be done, and be prepared to invest in setting up the right systems and human resources to create the platforms that provide value to customers.”Using APIs and partnering with third-party payment providers can help businesses remove the complexity of figuring it out themselves, allowing them to easily scale and expand their offerings to a larger global audience.With all the digital payment developments in the pipeline, Asia can look forward to a new and improved payments ecosystem soon.Currencycloud gives banks,businesses, and fintech companies everywhere the capability to move money across borders and transact globally in multiple currencies, fast.

Delivered every Wednesday via email and through the Tech in Asia website, this free newsletter breaks down the biggest stories and trends in fintech. If you’re not a subscriber, get access by registering here.Hello there,In the fragmented online lending market, one firm’s downfall is another’s gain.This week, we investigated investor allegations against Capital Match, a Singapore-based P2P firm that specializes in invoice financing.The P2P lending sector is no stranger to controversy, and Capital Match isn’t the first firm to go south. It also definitely won’t be the last.In recent times, you’d recall CoAssets’ fall from grace, a story Tech in Asia broke in December 2020. And just last week, we covered the plight of Indonesia-based UangTeman’s investors and their futile efforts to claw back their money since early 2021.P2P firms – at least in their most traditional sense – aren’t set up to be aligned with the investors they represent and the deals they enable. Unlike balance sheet lenders, many P2P firms do not have skin in the game – they purely provide a platform for lenders to connect with borrowers.When loans go bad, it’s the lenders who risk losing their capital, while P2P firms risk losing only interest on repayments. There’s also limited incentive for platforms to take an active role in loan recovery and maintain the credit quality of the assets they’re taking on.That said, to players serious about the long haul, having a good reputation matters. That means delivering on projected investment returns and keeping non-performing and default rates to a minimum, without compromising on credit quality even as loan books grow.But not all is bad. Several online lending platforms are going from strength to strength even as they emerge from what’s hopefully the worst of the pandemic.We examine one of them – Funding Societies and its US$144 million-backed push into Vietnam – in this week’s Hot Take.— MelissaTHE BIG STORYAnother P2P lender goes south: millions on the line for Capital Match’s investorsImage credit: Timmy LoenInvestors charge that years of poor oversight and irresponsible lending have compounded into a costly mistake for Capital Match.THE HOT TAKEFunding Societies’ new heavyweight investorFunding Societies co-founder and director Kelvin Teo / Photo credit: Funding SocietiesHere’s what happened:Last week, Funding Societies raised US$144 million in a series C+ round.The round was led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2 and joined by VNG Corporation and Rapyd Ventures, among others.The firm also received US$150 million in debt financing from institutional lenders from Europe, Asia, and the US.Here’s our take:Until now, Funding Societies’ main market has been Indonesia, where it operates as Modalku.The Singapore-headquartered firm, which also operates in Thailand, Malaysia, and Vietnam, targets MSMEs. It offers various lending products such as invoice financing, term loans, and supply chain financing, and the values of these loans can range from US$500 to as much as US$1.5 million.Its most recent funding round, however, signals its ambitions in Vietnam, whose internet economy is expected to see a compound annual growth rate of 29% to US$57 billion between 2021 to 2025 – a rate of growth outstripping even Indonesia’s – according to a report by Temasek and Bain &amp; Co.Most notably, Funding Societies may have pulled a coup with a prominent backer in VNG Corporation, the Vietnam-based gaming and entertainment unicorn that also owns social media platform Zalo, online media platform Zing News, digital payments app ZaloPay, and cloud services solutions provider VNG Cloud.Without discussing specifics, Funding Societies CEO Kelvin Teo told Reuters last week that it plans to use its financing business to launch its “new businesses.”VNG might offer some indication as to what those plans might be. Ryan Galloway, Funding Societies’ country director in Vietnam, has said that Zalo messenger and ZaloPay wallet could create “endless possibilities” for the fintech firm’s borrowers.In Vietnam, Zalo’s 52 million monthly active users place it even ahead of WhatsApp. As Funding Societies forges ahead with its neobanking ambitions in the country, Zalo’s “innate data value and network” opens up a huge opportunity.Since being flagged by regulators in 2021, Zalo does not provide loans to customers, though it refers them to third-party financial providers through its platform Fiza (short for Finance Zalo).Funding Societies could potentially tap Zalo’s data on users – as well as merchants – to roll out microfinancing products for them. This will lower the lending platform’s customer acquisition costs.That said, Funding Societies is not yet licensed in Vietnam, though a company spokesperson tells Tech in Asia that it is working with the country’s regulators. The spokesperson adds that customized or proprietary offerings will be rolled out as soon as “this or next year.”Together, both Funding Societies and VNG Group can create a “seamless customer experience” across lending, payments, spend management, and other services for SMEs, the spokesperson adds.With Funding Societies’ loan origination back on track after a tough start to the pandemic as well as a firm hold on default rates, which it has maintained at 1% to 2% for the “past few years,” Vietnam could hold the key to unlocking the lending platform’s next stage of growth.That said, Funding Societies is not the only SME lending platform setting its sights on Vietnam, or the only one pulling in partners with strong networks.In January, Singapore-headquartered Validus’ local unit, Validus Vietnam, formed a joint venture with VC firm Do Ventures and conglomerate TTC Group. Together, they aim to support SMEs in Vietnam through various financial inclusion initiatives.— MelissaNEWS YOU SHOULD KNOWCheck out Tech in Asia’s coverage of the fintech scene here.1️⃣ Tinder co-founder’s fund joins $31m round of PHL payments firm: B2B fintech firm PayMongo will use the fresh funds to develop new services such as disbursements, capital lending, subscriptions, recurring payments, and buy now, pay later.2️⃣ ShopBack in talks for $150m fundraise: Since its acquisition of BNPL firm Hoolah in November 2021, the online rewards platform is strengthening its fintech muscle by adding executives from Fave and PayPal to its team.3️⃣ AC Ventures leads $4m round of Indonesian crypto app: Founded in 2018, Nobi facilitates the buying and selling of cryptocurrencies, among other services.

It’s an international city and a hub of art, history, and culture – as well as a rising startup ecosystem in Asia Pacific.According to Startup Genome, the city came in 36th in its 2021 list of global startup ecosystems, and it saw US$529 million in early-stage funding that year. Melbourne’s startup ecosystem also grew in value to roughly US$7.6 billion in 2021.Photo credit: robynmac / 123RFThe city is home to several Australian unicorns such as Afterpay, Airwallex, and Judo Bank. Melbourne also has a culture of entrepreneurship, a huge talent pool, and an open economic environment that’s giving startups the opportunity to thrive.“Melbourne is still a relatively young ecosystem compared to other places in the world,” says Judy Anderson, the former CEO of Startup Victoria, a nonprofit grassroots founder community in Melbourne. “There’s a huge amount of energy in the city.”It’s also proving to be a promising destination for Southeast Asian startups that are looking to expand beyond Asia, thanks to the opportunities and support that the state of Victoria can give.What Melbourne has to offerUnderpinning the appeal that Melbourne holds for businesses in Southeast Asia are the strong ties between Australia and the region. The Australian government sees Southeast Asia as a key partner for trade and development. It has also enacted several policies to help drive investments into the country, including incentives to encourage research and development activities.The state government of Victoria, in particular, offers more specific support for businesses entering Melbourne. Invest Victoria, the state’s investment attraction agency, provides services such as grants and cash flow loans to new startups in the city.Melbourne is also home to many accelerators and incubators, which range from sector-agnostic organizations to dedicated, industry-specific programs.Aside from its resources for startups, the city has other key features that make it appealing to founders looking to expand their businesses.In Anderson’s view, Melbourne is teeming with talent, especially on the engineering and tech fronts.Judy Anderson, former CEO of Startup Victoria / Photo credit: Invest Victoria“Melbourne is famous for having some of the best engineering and developer talent in the world,” she explains. “If you’re looking for senior developers, the quality is insane, and in terms of the more junior tech talent, we’ve got a lot of newly-trained tech and engineering talent coming out of the universities here, which are among the top universities in Australia for tech and engineering.”Another key element of Melbourne’s appeal is the city’s connectedness. According to Anderson, the city’s startup community is tightly-knit, which means that new founders can easily find the resources, information, or introductions they need for their businesses. Startup Victoria, which is also one of Australia’s largest networks for entrepreneurs, runs community networking and outreach programs that help founders connect with prospective investors, partners, and employees.While there are plenty of benefits, resources, and support available in metropolitan Melbourne, the broader region of Victoria presents more opportunities for startups to tap into. Victoria is home to over 6.6 million people spread out across both urban and rural territories, and there are a few key verticals that Anderson says are seeing more activity in the region.“Melbourne is a wonderful city if you’re in health and medtech. We have great research facilities and institutions that we have set up here, at the University of Melbourne and Monash University,” she shares. “And if you’re working in agriculture or future foods, Victoria is a great place to be because we’ve got a really strong industry network in place.”Navigating the ecosystemMelbourne holds a lot of potential for Southeast Asian businesses, but the city’s startup scene is considered relatively young, which means that there isn’t as much support available for later-stage companies compared to other ecosystems.Also, while the city is teeming with talent, getting people on board is not easy, as Southeast Asian businesses “will be competing with local startups for that talent,” says Anderson.“So depending on the networking, connections, and relationship skills, connecting with the right talent could either be really difficult or perhaps a little bit easier,” she adds.However, Melbourne has several initiatives in place to help make the journey a little easier for businesses entering the city. For instance, founders can turn to the city’s highly-connected startup scene for support. Invest Victoria runs an Advisory Network program where companies can connect with potential partners, and it also offers services that support businesses in setting up operations in Melbourne.From Southeast Asia to MelbourneIt was the support of Invest Victoria that helped ease the entry of Singapore-based caregiving startup Homage into Melbourne in 2021.Founded in 2017, Homage offers a suite of home and nursing care services, and it has over 3,000 care professionals in its network. In an interview with Invest Victoria, Homage co-founder and CEO Gillian Tee shared that the firm saw “a sufficient breadth and depth of need in Australia” for its services. She cited the larger demand across Asia Pacific for care services, which is seeing a fast-growing ageing population, rising chronic disease incidence rates, and an ongoing shortage of caregivers.Gillian Tee, CEO and co-founder of Homage / Photo credit: HomageHowever, making the shift into Melbourne took a lot of effort for Homage, as the company needed to navigate the different administrative and logistical demands of entering a new market. This ranged from building up a local team to adapting its workflows and operations so that it aligned with the regulations of the Australian government.In the interview, Tee shared that Invest Victoria helped connect Homage to the relevant recruitment platforms, agencies, and office space providers to support the firm’s initial hiring and business setup process. The organization also helped Homage in facilitating visa applications for team members coming in from outside Australia.Invest Victoria also introduced Homage to partners in Melbourne, such as carer and nurse training institutions as well as State Government representatives of Victoria, so that the firm could explore new partnerships and expand its local pool of trained and qualified care providers to support its services.This helped smoothen Homage’s entry into Australia and ensured that the firm had a comfortable landing pad when it began operations in the new market.Another Southeast Asian company that has decided to set up in Melbourne is Indonesian ecommerce major Bukalapak. The firm has chosen Melbourne as its first international base and has established a research and development center in the city. It aims to tap into Victoria’s pool of tech talent and explore partnership opportunities to further its goal of transforming lives through technology.“Melbourne’s tech ecosystem is an ideal base for Bukalapak to establish this tech hub, which enables Indonesia’s tech talent to work together with tech professionals from Australia and around the world,” said Teddy Oetomo, president of Bukalapak, in an interview with Invest Victoria.Growing and going furtherThe Victorian government is committed to enabling the growth of new ventures in the region and has launched new initiatives to support this. One of these initiatives is the Breakthrough Victoria Fund, which will drive investments in areas such as health and life sciences, agri-food, advanced manufacturing, clean energy, and digital technologies.The government is also working to attract more capital into Victoria’s startup ecosystem, having invested US$59.8 million into the Victorian Startup Capital Fund, which aims to grow the region’s venture capital sector and drive investments into early-stage firms.Additionally, Invest Victoria has established offices in key markets in Southeast Asia such as Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam. These offices facilitate a startup’s entry into Victoria by providing tailored assistance to help founders on their journeys to international expansion.Anderson believes that these efforts, as well as the city’s connectedness and community, are what makes Melbourne a solid pick for Southeast Asian startups looking to expand their businesses abroad.“We’re trying to create one of the world’s most thriving startup communities, where founders have easy and equitable access to the tools and the guidance that they need to succeed in business,” she emphasizes. “It’s so quick and easy to navigate this ecosystem and to find what you’re looking for really quickly so you can move faster and achieve more.”Invest Victoria is the investment attraction agency of the State Government of Victoria, Australia. It bridges the gap between investors and the Victorian market and fosters long term economic prosperity by enabling business opportunities and job creation for Melbourne and Victoria.Learn more about the opportunities Melbourne and Victoria hold for your business at the Invest Victoria website.This content was produced by Tech in Asia Studios, which connects brands with Asia’s tech community.

733814,2022-02-23T01:55:11,2022-02-23T02:27:38,Another P2P lender goes south: millions on the line for Capital Match’s investors,p2p-lender-south-capital-matchs-investors-lost-millions-dollars,post,"In 2016, many investors in Singapore were piling their funds into peer-to-peer lending schemes at a time when China was clamping down on them hard.One particular P2P firm in Singapore was growing fast. Running on VC fuel, Capital Match would go on to finance more than S$150 million (US$111 million) to SMEs in Singapore and Hong Kong by 2019.But that growth may have come at the expense of its investors.No, this isn’t a story about clueless investors getting their fingers burnt.Image credit: Timmy LoenTwo investors, who each put “six figures” in US dollars into Capital Match between 2016 and 2019, are outraged by the allegedly inaccurate or false information provided to them, which they say misled them into investing.They aren’t just aggrieved because of their potential losses, which they accept is part and parcel of investing. Instead, they say that years of poor notification processes, irresponsible lending, and a lack of prompt recovery efforts on Capital Match’s part have compounded into a costly mistake for the platform’s many investors.Both investors spoke to Tech in Asia on condition of anonymity.On personal finance site Seedly, Capital Match has a 2.3 rating out of 5, with an investor cautioning others to “avoid this platform” in one review. Other platforms like Bridge and Funding Societies had ratings of 4.5 and 4.1, respectively, ranked on metrics like portfolio transparency, customer support, and user experience.Capital Match’s business, meanwhile, appears to have significantly declined from its heyday, its filings show.In an emailed statement to Tech in Asia, the company said it “strongly disagrees with any allegation of false or misleading information having been provided to investors on the platform.” It was unable to comment on its position on specific allegations, which are the subjects of ongoing court proceedings.P2P lending platforms are no strangers to controversy. In 2020, hundreds of investors on Singapore-based CoAssets saw their holdings evaporate as the firm shut down amid a growing mountain of troubled debt.See also: Millions lost, police reports filed: Behind the plight of CoAssets’ hapless investorsThat said, some like Funding Societies and Validus are going from strength to strength. Last week, Funding Societies raised US$294 million in funding from investors including Softbank Vision Fund 2 and VNG Group. Validus, in the meantime, is charting an expansion into Vietnam through a joint venture launched in January.As for Capital Match, it is waging a costly lawsuit in the Singapore High Court against Sanmina-SCI Systems, a subsidiary of electronics manufacturer Sanmina Corporation – a Fortune500 company – for S$10.4 million (US$7.7 million) in repayments on invoices that Capital Match says are owed to it.According to Capital Match, the “approximately S$10 million (US$7.4 million) in outstanding principal” in facilities on its platform comprises “less than 5%” of the US$163.5 million that the firm has disbursed to SMEs since 2015.But that’s also just a fraction of payments outstanding as Capital Match has multiple debtors, including shipbuilding firm Keppel Fels, electronics manufacturer Flextronics, and Japanese textile manufacturer Toyobo.The outstanding sum likely impacts hundreds of investors, but not all losses are final: Tech in Asia understands that the trial is expected to reconvene in March, with judgment expected later this year.Payments that never cameEstablished in 2014, Capital Match links investors to SMEs in need of upfront cash. It began offering invoice financing facilities in 2019.The firm is not licensed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). According to the regulator, whether a platform facilitating invoice factoring is required to hold a Capital Markets Services license “would depend on its business model, including the activities conducted, and the characteristics and terms of the transactions offered on the platform.”Capital Match enters into factoring agreements with SMEs, whereby it buys invoices issued by the SME and disburses upfront cash to the borrower using investor funds. In turn, the debtor repays the amount set out in the invoice directly to Capital Match.In Sanmina’s case, it allegedly didn’t pay a bulk of its obligations.Image credit: Timmy LoenThe US$7.7 million in question represents payments on over 2,800 invoices that were issued by Jeams Transportation &amp; Warehousing – an SME borrower on Capital Match’s platform – to Sanmina for services rendered between 2016 and 2019.In theory, arrangements like the one Capital Match has with Jeams are low-risk investments.Assuming invoices are properly verified, the investor takes on the credit risk of the debtor – often an established blue chip company – instead of the SME’s, says Louis (not his real name), who has invested in hundreds of facilities on Capital Match since 2016.Pierre (not his real name), an investor who has put money in several other P2P lending platforms, says he was drawn to Capital Match’s “semi-secured loans.” He began using the platform in 2016 and has invested in “well over a thousand” facilities since.It worked out for a while. Then, Pierre noticed many delayed payments on his facilities tied to Sanmina in 2019, some “long overdue.” He approached the P2P lender for answers.Capital Match already had this information but they were not sharing it with me.A Capital Match employee let slip that “a seller had died,” which might have been a reason for the delayed payments. Pierre says he found the reason suspicious: Even if the seller had passed away, Capital Match should have had the right to these invoices.Unable to get much out of Capital Match, Pierre began investigating. Through a lawyer, he found out that Jagit Singh, Jeams’ principal, had died in August 2019.Up till that point, Pierre did not know ‌the identity of the firm he had lent to, as Capital Match anonymizes the borrowers on its platform. Jumping through those hoops, however, was unnecessary, Pierre says. “Capital Match already had this information but they were not sharing it with me,” he adds.Later, Pierre was “shocked” and “disappointed” to find out that the firm involved – Sanmina – had allegedly not been notified in the way that Capital Match had explained to him.He had invested in notified facilities, in which the debtor – or the company that’s being billed the invoices – is informed about the factoring agreement between the lending platform and the SME borrower. The notification ensures that the debtor pays the lending platform when it’s time. It also gives the lending platform direct recourse to the debtor in events of late or non-payment. (In contrast, in unnotified facilities, debtors aren’t notified of these arrangements, and lending firms have to claw back payments from the SMEs.)Tech in Asia has viewed court documents submitted to the Singapore High Court by lawyers representing Capital Match and Sanmina.Sanmina-SCI Systems denies owing Capital Match US$7.7 million – or any other sum – in outstanding payments. It also denies receiving a Notice of Assignment (NOA) informing it of any factoring agreements between Capital Match and Jeams in 2016.Court documents reveal that the NOA, sent by Singh to Sanmina via email, had never reached Sanmina’s finance team, which it was addressed to, but was instead received by a “senior logistics supervisor.” It had supposedly also never been signed.Despite that, between 2016 and 2019, Sanmina’s finance team had paid out some S$4.1 million (US$3 million) to a Capital Match bank account that had been designated for Jeams’ debt. This, however, was just a fraction of the total bill.On Capital Match’s part, it says that summary lists of invoices, which were signed off by Sanmina’s employees, had served as a basis for entering into new factoring agreements with Jeams.However, around July 2019, the lending firm found that some of the invoices were fictitious.“All is well”Capital Match continued disbursing cash to SMEs despite having trouble collecting money from debtors.In June 2018, Capital Match disbursed S$66,000 (US$49,000) to Jeams and was trying to raise a further S$136,000 (US$101,000) for the SME despite being owed S$4.7 million (US$3.5 million) in outstanding payments from Sanmina, a WhatsApp conversation admitted into court evidence shows.In the same WhatsApp conversation, Singh revealed to a Capital Match employee that he was “desperate” to pay out salaries to employees, which had already been delayed.Eight months later, in February 2019, Capital Match continued to enter into new factoring agreements with Jeams even as the debt from Samina hit “about S$5.6 million” (US$4.2 million), with some invoices delayed by “close to a year,” a transcript of an audio recording submitted to court evidence shows.Capital Match says allegations made against it relating to these facilities are “false.”“It is a firm policy and a part of our SOP (standard operating procedure) that we do not disburse any additional funds to SMEs where we are not satisfied with their creditworthiness, or where there are outstanding payments,” a Capital Match spokesperson says.Another problem was that in parallel, Capital Match had been writing to investors to assure them that everything was well.In an update to investors dated June 7, 2019 and seen by Tech in Asia, Capital Match wrote that Jeams was “growing strongly,” and that it had facilitated financing of Jeams’ invoices to Sanmina for “more than two years now and there has been no default on any of the invoices.”That wasn’t all.WhatsApp screenshots between Singh and Capital Match’s commercial director revealed that Singh had borrowed money from the platform via two different entities – “Jeams T&amp;T” and “Jeams T&amp;W.” The former likely refers to Jeans Transport &amp; Trading, a separate entity that Singh also oversaw.Because the identities of the SMEs were anonymized, investors did not know that they were doubly exposed to the same person – Singh – because both entities would have been listed under a different serial number on the platform.“In conversations I’ve had with Capital Match, they haven’t been willing to acknowledge that their conduct has effectively led to this,” says Pierre.Lack of information?Online lenders do keep borrower identities a secret for a good reason: SME borrowers prefer to be discreet in case its customers, suppliers, competitors, or employees are also investors on the platform.A Capital Match spokesperson explains that it does so to prevent other parties from contacting borrowers on its platform to offer them additional financing, which might in turn increase the credit risks of its borrowers.“Investors are provided information on relevant details on the SMEs and any guarantors in accordance with our SOP, with such information being sufficient to identify any connection between related SMEs on the platform,” the spokesperson adds.Photo credit: Capital Match websiteOn another major lending platform, borrower identities can be shared with its investors but strictly after getting a request, its CEO tells Tech in Asia.With such a practice, a big drawback for investors is that they can’t conduct their own due diligence or verify the information shared by the platform.In Capital Match’s case, this information is typically collated on a “request sheet” that details the total loan quantum sought, expected payment date, monthly interest rate, as well as the identity of the debtor. It also includes financial statements – albeit unaudited – in the preceding years and various methods of recourse the debtor has in the event of defaults.Tech in Asia looked through over a dozen of these “request sheets” that laid out investment terms for notified securities backed by Keppel Fels, Sanmina, Flextronics, and Toyobo.An estimated S$1.2 million (US$890,000) in defaults have occurred on facilities linked to Flextronics and another S$2 million (US$1.5 million) on those linked to Toyobo, based on one investor’s back-of-the-hand calculations, though the outstanding sums are possibly more.Capital Match also began legal action against sellers and their guarantors in a Toyobo-linked facility in March 2020. Legal proceedings are ongoing.Investors on the platform are still owed funds from facilities linked to Keppel Fels that date back to 2016, after Capital Match told investors in December that year that it found “issues with some invoices involving inconsistencies internally at Keppel.” It also stopped offering invoices issued to Keppel on the platform at the end of November 2016.That’s despite several of these facilities being personally guaranteed by the borrower’s directors, who owned a freehold terrace valued at S$2.8 million (US$2.1 million), request sheets dated in 2016 show.In September 2017, investors were told that the freehold terrace, which was in the process of liquidation, was valued at “US$2.9m+ with an outstanding mortgage of around US$2.2m.” There was no mention of any outstanding mortgage prior to this, Louis says. Effectively, the dollar value of the personal guarantee had shrunk by about a third.In response to a letter of demand that Louis sent in April 2021, Capital Match said that the property owners had not been forthcoming with those details. “We are not responsible for any representations made by parties in the facilities, nor are we responsible for the adequacy, accuracy and/or completeness of any information supplied by parties to the facilities entered into,” it wrote.Further, request sheets stated that the facilities would be backed by a trade credit insurance that was “in process” and would “require a few weeks to get finalized.” This would protect Capital Match – and its investors – against defaulted payments.However, Louis says he found out in 2021 that the trade insurance policy never materialized. When quizzed, Capital Match said that there had been no representation that the insurance policies were guaranteed, but the firm also didn’t update investors about the policy’s status.Sporadic updatesLouis says that over the years, he has had to chase Capital Match dozens of times for updates, but responses from the firm were sporadic and vague.On one Keppel Fels-linked facility that was in arrears, Louis recounts receiving his first update only 82 days after its stipulated payment date in September 2016. He was never updated when it was first delayed, or even when it was 30 days late, but “only when it was almost in technical default,” Louis says.Then, in June 2020, Louis noticed that the multiple facilities relating to Keppel Fels were suddenly marked as “bad debt.” Upon clarification, a representative for the firm explained that recovery efforts were still underway.Capital Match tells Tech in Asia that its updates can be sent “anytime between 60 to 90 days” past payment due dates and that delays beyond its control, such as from court proceedings, can lead to updates only being provided when there are significant developments. It adds that a majority of its investors are satisfied with the timeliness of its updates.Both investors say they have put in requests to review and inspect documents relating to their facilities, but were declined.In response to these allegations, Capital Match says that all investors who make a request to review and inspect documents relating to financial transactions at its offices can do so.It has, however, rejected some requests in 2020 because its offices were closed due to the pandemic. It has also rejected requests that were related to facilities that were the subject of proceedings before the Singapore Courts. The firm adds that it had provided these reasons to relevant investors at the material time.MAS guidelines on securities-based crowdfunding operators do not ​​spell out if, and how soon, investors have to be informed in the event of a default. That said, Capital Match is not licensed by the MAS.On another major lending platform, investors get updates on delinquent accounts “after the grace period of seven days past due,” after which they are updated regularly on its platform about its collection efforts, its CEO tells Tech in Asia.Enter SesamiIt’s unclear why Capital Match continued to extend millions of dollars of financing to Jeams despite the accumulation of alleged unpaid invoices by Sanmina.Capital Match’s aggressive lending to Jeams could have been aimed at bolstering its loan books in the lead-up to a merger with Sesami, a Singapore-headquartered procurement firm, in November 2018.Sesami was a profitable software company serving large corporate customers like Singapore Airlines and the National Healthcare Group that spent millions on procurement from SME suppliers. A merger would give Capital Match an immediate pipeline of new clients while turning Sesami into a tech company overnight.In theory, the merged entity would be larger than the sum of its parts: It was expected to see combined revenues of “more than S$20 million” (more than US$14.9 million) and be profitable on an EBITDA basis.But the benefits of the merger didn’t appear to have been realized on either end. Official filings show that since 2019, Capital Match’s assets and revenues have taken a dive. Its accumulated losses also increased by almost fivefold between 2019 and 2021.Sesami’s revenue, meanwhile, was only US$3.6 million in 2021.A former employee says that disagreements in direction and leadership styles between Pawel Kuznicki, Capital Match’s Polish founder and former CEO, and Teck Soon Ong, Sesami’s CEO, hampered that vision. Both of them served as co-CEOs of the new entity. A “big cultural gap” also existed between Sesami, which was run by “much older guys,” and the young, dynamic team at Capital Match.In July 2019, Kuznicki stepped down from his leadership post without giving a reason.Things appeared to go downhill after his departure. “The company was built in [Kuznicki’s] image and when he left, it was very difficult for the company to carry on,” the ex-employee says.A source close to the company tells Tech in Asia that the company lacked the depth of experience in the financial sector to manage the risks that came with its growing loan book. Sesami executives also did not have the experience to run a fintech firm.Tech in Asia was unable to reach Kuznicki for comment on this story.Investor safeguardsCapital Match continues to solicit new investors to its platform.Source: Capital Match’s website accessed in January 2022A page on the Capital Match website displayed its rates of return on investments, as well as non-performing loan rates for 2020 when Tech in Asia accessed the platform in January.The page has since been removed.Capital Match’s performance for 2020 as per figures published on its site. The firm has since removed all statistics on its website. / Source: Capital Match’s website assessed in January 2022Unpublished figures from 2016 to 2017 that were obtained from the site’s source code show that the quality of credit on the platform has deteriorated some years after 2016.Capital Match says it cannot confirm that these figures were shared on the platform in the past.A spokesperson from the firm adds that less than 0.23% of its invoice financing facilities in 2020 and 2021 have gone beyond 60 days past due, and that the average return on its platform in the past two years was “approximately 11% per annum” on the funds deployed.According to Louis, the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) is currently investigating Capital Match for operating without the proper licenses. Tech in Asia reached out to the CAD to obtain an update on the case, but it declined to comment.Tech in Asia also understands that a lawsuit against Capital Match was brought to the High Court at the end of last year on the grounds that it had misled investors. The lawsuit has since been withdrawn.Louis, who has approached the MAS for assistance, says he was told that as an unlicensed entity, Capital Match does not fall under its purview. “As an investor, you should really think twice when you do investments in Singapore because in practice, there’s hardly any recourse,” Louis says.In a statement to Tech in Asia, an MAS spokesperson says: “MAS strongly encourages investors to deal only with entities regulated by MAS, so that they will be protected by the laws administered by MAS. By dealing with unregulated persons or entities (including those based overseas), investors will forgo the protection given under the MAS regulations.”Louis admits that it was an oversight on his part to invest through an unlicensed platform, which he had not been aware of at the time, and that he would have “been more careful” had he known.He’s now close to exhausting his options.The cost of pursuing legal action can be prohibitive for individual investors in Singapore. Louis says that he has been advised that a lawsuit could cost him “between S$200,000 to S$600,000 in court fees” (between US$149,000 to US$446,000), making little sense for an investor to file one unless they’re owed well more than that.Though rare in Singapore, minority stakeholders have come together to take representative action. While banding together does not necessarily increase the chances of a better outcome, one upside is that hefty legal costs can be split.That said, representative action in Singapore requires all members of the class to be identified and agreed upon before litigation commences, which could pose a challenge.While Louis still hopes to recover a partial sum of his capital, he isn’t hopeful. “Realistically, I don’t think that’s going to happen, but I do hope to protect future investors,” Louis says. “Hundreds if not thousands of investors who are affected who have families who worked for that money.”Currency converted from Singapore dollars to US dollars: US$1 = S$1.34.",Investors charge that years of poor oversight and irresponsible lending have compounded into a costly mistake for Capital Match.,300605,Melissa Goh,True,Terence Lee and Lorenzo Kyle Subido,0,"['Fintech', 'Management', 'Premium Content']","['capital match', 'fintech', 'online lending', 'online lending platform', 'p2p', 'P2P Lending', 'Sesami', 'Singapore', 'SME lending']",False,,True,True,True,False,15

Its monthly transactions also hit over US$800 million, a threefold increase from the same period the previous year.“We are on track to double those numbers this year,” Fazz Financial CEO Hendra Kwik told Tech in Asia.Fazz Financial Group co-founder Tianwei Liu (left) and Hendra Kwik / Photo credit: Fazz Financial GroupFazz Financial is the new entity that emerged after Singapore-based Xfers and Payfazz – which Kwik co-founded – joined forces last year. Both companies are graduates of Y Combinator, the US-based startup accelerator. Kwik now serves as group CEO of Fazz Financial, while Xfers co-founder Tianwei Liu is the deputy CEO.Since 2016, Payfazz and Xfers have collectively raised more than US$74.1 million in funding from prominent investors such as Tiger Global and DST Partners. Fazz Financial currently serves more than 150,000 businesses and has around 600 employees.Building a financial super appAfter Payfazz poured US$30 million investment into Xfers last year, the companies decided to integrate their products and come up with a combined offering.Payfazz usually only serves SMEs, but it can now cater to startups and big enterprises, thanks to Xfers’ API solution. On the other hand, Xfers can also provide Payfazz-developed solutions in Singapore.The “marriage” seems to be a fruitful one in terms of processed transactions. Payfazz, which initially only operated in Indonesia, now gets almost half of its gross merchandise value (GMV) from its Singapore business, according to Kwik.StraitsX, an Xfers service that focuses on digital assets, registered US$1.5 billion in transactions from January to October 2021.See also: This CEO is building the “Google Play of financial services” for IndonesiaFazz Financial currently has four business models: payments enabler, cash storing, credit solution, and financial tools (which includes HR management and bookkeeping). The company generates revenue from commissions or subscription fees.While payment solutions are still its bread and butter, Fazz Financial said that growth from credit solutions and financial tool subscriptions also looks promising.Today, its service is still fragmented into different apps. For example, users need to download the Payfazz app for bills payment, Payfazz Buku for bookkeeping services, and Modal Rakyat to apply for loans.Fazz Financial plans to combine all of those services into one app in the near future.“The strategy moving forward is to build a financial super app that can serve every business, from a small one-man shop to big enterprises,” CFO Karl Hu told Tech in Asia.Fazz Financial did not offer any details about the name of the potential super app. However, it will still use the financial licenses it owns – ranging from e-money and payment acceptance to money transfer, lending, and other banking functions – through its subsidiaries.The company likens its planned super app with solutions offered by US-based Brex, Denmark’s Pleo, and Paris-headquartered Qonto.Continue to reinvest profitsKwik says that Payfazz had become profitable last year, prior to Xfers deal. However, the company decided to reinvest the money to chase further growth, especially in the enterprise market.If Fazz Financial successfully raises the series C round, it will use the funds to hire more engineers and build more products.The company’s primary targets are still Indonesia and Singapore. However, Kwik isn’t shy about his ambition to enter other markets in Southeast Asia in the future, following the path of super app Grab.“Today, we want to focus on the two markets where we have licenses and brand presence. After we become the undisputed winner, we will extract the profit to invest in other countries,” Kwik said.",The fintech firm also said that its monthly revenue doubled to US$2.6 million in December 2021.,86192,Aditya Hadi Pratama,True,Collin Furtado and Eileen C.

These gaming assets cost nearly US$1.7 million, which marks a 15x growth in value for the decentralized gaming company.Developed by Vietnam-based Sky Mavis, Axie Infinity continued to be the top game for YGG in 2021.The guild said that its earnings from SLP (or small love potion, Axie Infinity‘s in-game digital currency) generated US$1.3 million in revenue in 2021. YGG scholars – players who borrow axies to join the game – made US$11.7 million, while its community managers earned US$2.6 million in the same period.Photo credit: YGGYGG uses a 70-20-10 scholarship model. Scholars get the largest share at 70% and community managers take 20%, while the remanining 10% goes to YGG.However, YGG’s SLP earnings dropped 69% in December 2021 compared to the previous month. It also saw a roughly 12% reduction in the total number of SLPs farmed.One reason for this slide was the 19% jump in the price of SLP tokens after Sky Mavis issued a fresh update for Axie Infinity.YGG’s report further noted that its scholars had farmed almost 132 million SLP tokens in total as of December 2021. While SLP farming fell that month, the company saw it soar in November, marking a nearly 123% surge compared to October.Photo credit: YGGThe value of YGG’s assets on its other top games increased as well.

Of that amount, nearly 76% was spent on play-to-earn games, 17.4% on gaming guilds, and 6.4% on what YGG describes as play-to-earn infrastructure games.“We will continue to grow and forge new partnerships to expand the reach of YGG as we help the play-to-earn market mature.

Of this, about 54.7% went to play-to-earn games, 27.4% was for gaming guilds to expand the reach of YGG, and 17.8% was targeted at platforms and infrastructure that would support the wider play-to-earn ecosystem.The above-mentioned amount also includes US$2.9 million towards game partnerships.

Southeast Asia is among the most vulnerable to these changes and is already witnessing more floods every year. By 2030, the estimated cost of damages due to rising sea levels in urban areas such as Bangkok, Jakarta, Manila, Taipei, Seoul, Tokyo, and Hong Kong is pegged at US$724 billion.This has caught the attention of FlexBase, a Dutch-based climate change-focused firm that has entered Southeast Asia with its expertise in constructing floating buildings.The company tells Tech in Asia that it will start its expansion by investing US$1 million to set up its international office in Singapore and plans to hire for five key functions: operations, business development, sales and marketing, and engineering. For now, it says it will focus on the Thailand and Vietnam markets.“One of the things that makes Southeast Asia so interesting is the fact that the population growth is enormous. So that requires a lot of land, not only to live on but also to grow food,” says Shiwen Yap, co-founder of FlexBase International.FlexBase founder Jan Willem Roel / Photo credit: FlexBaseFounded in 2013 by engineer Jan Willem Roel, FlexBase builds floating structures based on a hybrid polystyrene-concrete model called the FlexBase Concept System. The hybrid material allows the firm to develop large relatively affordable floating structures at scale and minimizes the use of concrete and steel, which FlexBase claims reduces the carbon footprint of such structures. It is also significantly less expensive and lighter than marine-grade steels.In Southeast Asia, the firm wants to enhance urban resilience along coastal cities by promoting floating structures as a practical approach.“The long-term solution would be rather than you try to reclaim the land, fill it in, and then often sink – why not just build on top of the water?” says Yap.Living on waterThe concept of floating houses is not new: Coastal communities in Cambodia and the Philippines, for example, feature boats fitted with dwelling spaces or houses built on stilts. “Floatels,” or floating hotels, are present across Southeast Asia as well.There is also a Dutch firm, Finch Floating Homes, which uses recycled plastic barrels as the foundation of its structures. It has already built a pilot home in the Philippines.Traditional floating village on Inle lake in Myanmar / Photo credit: 123RF.comFlexBase’s idea of floating structures, on the other hand, uses expanded polystyrene, a type of foam that can withstand loads while staying afloat. The material can also be recycled if needed and is protected with polyurea – a coating agent used to protect structures against the elements – which lowers maintenance costs in the process. This system, the company says, makes its structures unsinkable.“When you look at the total cost of ownership, the total lifecycle cost over steel, or in construction versus one with our system, I think we’re looking at much better returns overall and also much less carbon emitted,” Yap says.FlexBase founder Roel also dispels concerns about the material’s potential harm to the environment, stressing its recyclability and longevity. “I can guarantee it can float for 50 years,” he shares.However, there is the issue of market-readiness, as homeowners typically prefer to build on solid ground.FlexBase previously completed floating houses in Bangladesh and the Philippines, two flood-prone countries that have high exposure and vulnerability to natural hazards, according to a World Risk Report. However, the company says its houses are not seeing much demand in these areas.“Living on water is socially unacceptable, and in general, people are afraid of water and therefore don’t feel safe. We see these issues in the whole ASEAN region,” says Roel.Besides this challenge, there is the issue of cost. Roel says that to build something on water will be 50% more expensive than constructing something on land. While land prices can be steep in general, the pricing of an area of water varies, so it is also difficult to give a price per square meter for floating structures due to numerous factors.“I want to know, how deep is the water? How big are the waves? Is there a lot of water current? What is the location?” says Roel.The company’s Bangladesh project, for example, cost 200 euros (US$226) per square meter, over 3x cheaper than the average price of US$712 per square meter for an apartment in the outskirts of Dhaka’s city center.But while the structure’s foundation is cheaper “by 25% to 40%” compared to steel, building on water piles on costs for additional features like entrances and bridges.These setbacks have pushed FlexBase to target businesses in the region instead.Bystanders build a makeshift footbridge for pedestrians as monsoon rains flood Manila’s streets. / Photo credit: 123RF.comThe firm’s focus in Southeast Asia will be to enter the hospitality, agriculture, aquaculture, and energy spaces. Besides building floating hotels and farms, its system can also carry solar panels and turbines, which addresses food security and employment concerns, says Yap.The global market for floating power plants alone is expected to breach US$2.4 billion by 2028. Meanwhile, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has earmarked US$100 billion of funding for climate financing between 2019 and 2030.“In Asia alone, if 5% of these [ADB] funds are spent on novel solutions like floating construction, that’s a US$5 billion market over this decade,” shares Yap.The company says that for its target businesses in sinking regions of Southeast Asia, the benefit of future-proofing structures by making them float is worth the investment.Regulations that float across the SEAScaling floating infrastructures in Southeast Asia is not that easy. While the Netherlands has regulations in place for floating structures, Asian countries don’t. There is also another conflict: The type of construction sits between conventional building codes and maritime vessel standards, so countries in the region must make new rules in this context.Flooding rice paddies in rural Thailand as rainstorm Tien Mu swept through Thailand and caused heavy rainfall / Photo credit: 123RFThis is one reason FlexBase went to Singapore. According to Roel and Yap, it’s a country known for stringent regulatory practices, and operating in the city-state could help define the rules for floating structures in Asia.“Once that is established, and with the rules that come with it, then we can use those as precedents for other countries to build,” says Yap.FlexBase is currently preparing to build two floating projects in Singapore, which it says will involve private as well as public groups. These initiatives include a 50,000 square meter sports facility and a food court complex. The company is also partnering with the National University of Singapore to build a study location on a floating vertical farm concept.With concerns on sea level rise and other disasters having gone unanswered at the recent COP26 climate change conference, countries whose cities will sink in a few decades must find ways to keep lives and properties afloat.FlexBase’s entry into Singapore could build new construction standards for the region and offer an alternative for countries that want to ride the rising tide.Currency converted from euro to US dollar: US$1 = 0.88 euros","FlexBase, which specializes in creating floating buildings and homes, will invest US$1 million to set up its base in Singapore.",572228,Roehl Niño Bautista,True,Collin Furtado and Jaclyn Tiu,0,"['GreenTech', 'Investments', 'News', 'Premium Content']","['climate change', 'climate change adaptability', 'Flexbase', 'floating buildings', 'floating houses', 'greentech', 'netherlands', 'Singapore', 'Southeast Asia']",False,,True,True,True,False,6

Thus far, the company has failed to ‌pay outstanding salaries to its former employees, among other internal issues.The group of 11 investors who poured 9 billion rupiah (nearly US$628,000) to be disbursed as UangTeman loans told Tech in Asia that they stopped receiving payments of any kind by March 2021.Unpaid promises: One of the company’s investors told Tech in Asia that he has been trying to cash out his investments since March 2021. But like UangTeman employees, he was repeatedly told that he would be repaid once the startup receives a cash injection or gets acquired. By that point, he and other investors had stopped receiving their interest income as well.Plan of action: UangTeman is said to have told the investors that it planned to pivot from consumptive loans to productive ones (i.e., loans for entrepreneurs and businesses, instead of payday cash loans that the startup had mostly disbursed). However, it’s unclear whether that plan materialized – previous reports have said that by April 2020, the company had stopped disbursing loans.Overwhelming principles: Investors have also raised concerns about claiming insurance on their investments, which supposedly covers up to 85% of the principal amount. But it is likely the insurance only covers events where borrowers fail to repay their loan – not UangTeman’s deteriorating health as a company.Read more: Investors in UangTeman struggle to claw back their moneyStartup spotlightAn Indian unicorn’s flight to SEAImage credit: Timmy LoenDealShare, an India-based social commerce firm, has raised US$45 million as part of its series E round.

Delivered every Monday via email and through the Tech in Asia website, this free newsletter breaks down the biggest stories and latest trends on Asia’s publicly-listed tech companies. If you’re not a subscriber, get access by registering here.Hello reader,A whirlwind, a hurricane, or an earthquake? Whatever it was, a Free Fire-ban-sized calamity sent Sea Group’s (SE, NYSE) share price on an almighty plunge, with the tech behemoth enduring its biggest one-day fall last week. Its shares are currently trading a little over 60% below its 52-week high of US$372.70.The Singapore-based firm shed US$16 billion in market value – a roughly 18% drop – after India banned Free Fire, the best-selling game of Sea’s digital entertainment unit Garena. The Indian government considers the title a threat to national security. This led to a spate of downgrades or price target cuts by analysts and Sea’s shares ended the week down around 20%.The ban on Free Fire has certainly shaken Sea’s investors, with fears growing over whether the ban could be extended to include another of its pillars in Shopee.In our premium story analyzing Shopee’s odds in India, my colleague Samreen notes that the ecommerce platform has made a strong start in the country but faces strong competition from the likes of Amazon, Flipkart, Meesho, and Snapdeal.Image credit: Timmy LoenA bright spot ‌in the life of Forrest Li, Sea’s chairman and CEO, went largely unnoticed amid the chaos of his company’s share price. Shareholders approved changes last week that further entrenched Li’s control over Sea, giving him 57% of total voting power.However, Sea has no time to relax – this premium story breaks down Garena’s slowing growth, Shopee’s revitalized competitors in its Southeast Asian markets, and the dangers of expanding at breakneck speeds.Many questions remain up in the air. Will Sea sail through the Garena slowdown? How much will India’s ban on Free Fire impact Sea’s top and bottom lines? Perhaps investors will be treated to a few definite answers when Sea releases its Q4 2021 earnings report on March 1.— Shravanth4 Stocks to watchHot stocks, earnings reports, restructuring, activist investor pressure, and more. We feature the stocks that are likely to make big moves during the week.Image credit: Timmy Loen🇸🇬 Grab (GRAB, NDAQ): The super app has lost more than half its market value since it debuted in public markets in December. However, Temasek seems to have sensed a buying opportunity. Singapore’s state-owned investment firm disclosed a stake in Grab via securities filings.🇮🇳 Reliance Industries Limited (RELIANCE, NSE): The conglomerate’s telecommunications arm, Reliance Jio, lost nearly 13 million wireless subscribers in December 2021. This follows another sharp drop three months prior, when the firm lost around 19 million subscribers. Jio was the worst hit of India’s telecom operators in a broader nationwide slump in total wireless subscribers due to recent tariff hikes. In other news, Jio was the sole investor in the funding round of this Singapore-headquartered unicorn.🇺🇸 Amazon (AMZN, NDAQ): The ecommerce titan brought an end to its long-standing tussle with Visa (V, NYSE) over payment fees that threatened to dent the financial giant’s business and disrupt ecommerce payments. Amazon will no longer charge an extra fee for customers who use Visa cards on its platform in Singapore and Australia.🇨🇳 Tencent (0700, HKG): Already dealing with China’s big tech crackdown, the gaming and social media giant is also struggling to find friends on the other side of the world. Ecommerce sites operated by Tencent were included on the US government’s latest “notorious markets” list. While inclusion on the list is a blow to Tencent’s reputation, it carries no direct penalties.3 Market WhispersA lot more reliable than a whisper as we highlight engaging source-based reporting from reputable news outlets around the globe.Image credit: Timmy Loen1️⃣ To err on the side of caution: Share markets are falling. Bond markets are falling. Geopolitical tensions and inflation are rising. There is nowhere to hide for investors and this sentiment has rippled through India’s IPO market. Prominent tech startups such as hospitality firm Oyo and logistics provider Delhivery have taken notice and are now hitting the brakes on their public debuts.2️⃣ Pink slips: A prime target of China’s tech clampdown, DiDi Global (DIDI, NYSE) has lost more than 70% in market value since its listing last June – one of the biggest IPOs for a Chinese company listed on an American exchange. The ride-hailing firm is now going for a massive layoff across all departments. While 20% of overall staff will be let go, the headcount for each of DiDi’s operations and business departments will be reduced by 20% as well.3️⃣ Reading between the lines: Recently listed tech firms in India are feeling the strain of the broader market route. Shares of Zomato (ZOMATO, NSE), Paytm (PAYTM, NSE), and Nykaa (NYKAA, NSE) hit all-time lows last week. In a nod to the current market conditions, PharmEasy may readjust the valuation it was aiming for through a public offering. The online pharmacy’s shares are currently being traded in the gray market at a significantly lower price compared to last year.2 Quotes from the wiseWitty excerpts that leave you either scratching your head or grinning at your screen. Tech in Asia honors the changemakers of our time and of days gone by.HODLers look away – “It’s like some venereal disease or something. I just regard it as beneath contempt,” said Charlie Munger, a reputed investor and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, NYSE) vice chairman, when discussing cryptocurrencies. This will not be entirely surprising for crypto enthusiasts, given that the 98-year-old Munger has been a long-time crypto critic.Image credit: Pixabay“There are significant concerns regarding the design and magnitude of the equity award made to [Apple] CEO [Tim] Cook in FY21 … Half of the award lacks performance criteria,” proxy advisory firm ISS said in a letter.

But none have captured its imagination as much as a mysterious Hindu monk that ran India’s top bourse, the National Stock Exchange (NSE).The guru was running the exchange, and Chitra Ramkrishna, the former CEO of the NSE, was “merely a puppet in his hands,” according to a probe by market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India. Ramkrishna shared confidential information with the guru and sought his advice on crucial decisions, the investigation found.

Indeed, funding has caught up too: In 2021, SaaS companies collectively raised US$400 million – a record.SaaS is an umbrella term for a variety of solutions such as point of sales, human resource information systems, management software, and web hosting plus ecommerce.Based on an analysis of funding rounds, SaaS firms serving the retail sector have banked the most cash to date (around US$272 million), powered by the likes of MSME bookkeeping apps BukuWarung and Lummo. Those serving the POS sector come next, including firms like Gojek-backed Moka. Management software is in third place in terms of funding, with firms such as e-logistics platform Waresix and food and beverage enterprise solution ESB, which bagged US$151 million.You can find the breakdown below.Some companies have diversified beyond their initial SaaS offerings. Sirclo, for instance, began as a Shopify-like web store for burgeoning online businesses but has now expanded into a full-fledged ecommerce enabler.Much of that happened through mergers and acquisitions. Sirclo merged with ecommerce agency Icube in 2020, before going on to acquire new-retail startup Warung Pintar and parenting platform Orami.Mekari is another acquisition-heavy company. Last year, it acquired CRM platform Qontak shortly after raising US$18 million in series D funding.

Get the newsletter in your inbox everyday with a Premium subscription.Hi readers,I don’t think I’m the only one who’s been shopping online more often amid this pandemic. As we go through lockdowns and work from our homes, ecommerce seems like the best choice for buying anything and everything.Waiting for packages to arrive has become one of my new hobbies lately – and maybe many others feel the same way.That’s why ecommerce growth continues to rise at a time when several industries are fading. Logistics and other sectors closely tied to ecommerce also do not appear to be in a slump.Logistics providers are actually getting busier as more people do their shopping online. This explains why companies such as J&amp;T Express – an Indonesia-based startup strongly affiliated with Chinese smartphone vendor Oppo – are daring to spread their wings outside its home turf.After venturing into other Southeast Asian countries as well as China, J&amp;T has officially landed in the Middle East. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are the company’s first two markets in the region.However, the pandemic is not the only factor that drove J&amp;T Express to go global in such a short time. Its business strategy is also vital to realizing this international ambition.Still, a big question awaits J&amp;T Express: Can its strategy be sustainable in the long term?— Jofie Yordan, journalist at Tech in AsiaTop stories this weekImage credit: Timmy Loen1️.

Whether it’s the jingle playing over the radio or countless ads plastered at bus stops and shopping malls, the company has cemented a place for itself. But while it has found major success in the region, it’s a relatively newer player in India, so making a foothold in there won’t be a walk in the park.Quick off the blocks: According to Sensor Tower data, Shopee got over 20 million downloads in India after its launch in November 2021.  It was also the second most downloaded shopping app in India for December 2021 and January 2022, placing it just behind Meesho, according to Data.ai.Sharing is caring: Shopee’s goal in India is to “attract new customers who are coming online for the first time and are looking to make small ticket-size purchases,” says Satish Meena, co-founder of Sutradhar and a former senior forecast analyst at Forrester. This places Shopee in competition with firms such as Meesho and Snapdeal, which target consumers in Tier 2 and 3 towns.Rules and regulations: Despite a good start, regulatory headwinds could be on the horizon for Shopee. The Indian government has been on a banning spree of “China-linked” apps, and Shopee is at risk of falling under this category.Read more: Can Shopee win in India?Startup spotlightHolding out for a heroSydney-based Employment Hero secured US$130 million in its latest fundraise, putting it within reach of unicorn territory and bringing its total funding to US$286 million.

The deal acquisition allows Employment Hero to offer a complete suite of employment management solutions and accelerate its growth initiatives in its home market as well as Singapore, Malaysia, New Zealand, and the UK.On the up: Employment Hero has some lofty goals for the next five years, as it seeks to boost the number of its users from 750,000 to 10 million. It doesn’t appear to be a pipe dream: The firm posted a growth rate of 110% in the financial year ended March 2021 and expects that figure to remain healthy throughout 2022, according co-founder and CEO Ben Thompson.Sailing further into SEA: The company is also eyeing further expansion into Southeast Asia by the end of this year.

That amount only covers the principal – i.e., it does not include interest and other fees.Photo credit: UangTemanOne such investor is Edmund (not his real name), who told Tech in Asia that he has been trying to cash out his investments since March 2021. But like UangTeman employees, he was repeatedly told that he would be repaid once the startup receives a cash injection or gets acquired. (UangTeman reportedly found a buyer earlier this year, with the acquisition process to be completed by April.)That said, Edmund notes that FTI Consulting – the firm handling UangTeman’s bankruptcy proceedings – recently contacted the investor group for further discussions. Tech in Asia reached out to FTI Consulting, but the company has yet to reply.A gradual declineAccording to the investors, they heard about UangTeman through a Telegram group that discusses investment opportunities. A convincing factor appears to be UangTeman’s operational track record (it had been in business for a few years by that point) and its online lending license from Otoritas Jasa Keuangan (OJK), Indonesia’s financial services authority.UangTeman had also said that it was planning a pivot from consumptive loans to productive ones (i.e., loans for entrepreneurs and businesses, instead of payday cash loans that the startup had mostly disbursed), says an investor.Belinda (not her real name) first invested in July 2020 for a three-month term. She had no trouble collecting interest income, and when the company offered an extension with higher interest rates, she agreed.However, problems began appearing by early 2021. Some UangTeman investors who wanted to cash out their principals were told to wait while others ceased getting their interest income.“I started receiving late interest payments in November 2020,” recalls Belinda. “In January 2021, I only received part of the payments, and by February 2021, I stopped receiving anything.”UangTeman’s South Jakarta office has since been sealed by building management.The other investors who spoke to Tech in Asia affirmed that by March 2021, payments of any kind came to a halt.According to the investors, Aidil Zulkifli – UangTeman’s erstwhile CEO – said in an official company letter that they would be repaid by the end of July 2021. However, they experienced what UangTeman employees already knew – the repayment did not materialize.By September 2021, the investors were referred to FTI Consulting, which had been appointed as UangTeman’s judicial manager. Records at the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority show that from June 17, 2021, Zulkifli had been disqualified from acting as director of Digital Alpha Group Pte Ltd, UangTeman’s Singapore-based parent firm.However, communications with FTI Consulting were minimal, the investors say. By the end of 2021, there was still little clarity on whether they would get their money back.A murky viewThe investors have also raised questions about insurance. According to Edmund, their investments are insured up to 85% of the principal amount. He asked about how to process the claim, but the company did not offer a solution.A former UangTeman senior executive pointed out that per OJK regulations, all of these investments are insured. However, the insurance only covers events caused by borrowers who fail to repay their loans.Given these circumstances, no one knows whether these investors can claim the insurance. For one, UangTeman had stopped disbursing loans from April 2020, based on previous reports. Thus, it’s unclear whether these difficulties were due to non-performing loans or the company’s deteriorating health.Ultimately, these investors join a chorus of UangTeman stakeholders who are awaiting repayment. In addition to former staff, there are also vendors whose invoices for services rendered have not been paid.“We’re quite bloodied by this point,” says Belinda. “People might think that we as investors or lenders have a lot of money. That’s not necessarily the case, especially in a pandemic.”","Eleven people put in over US$600,000 in UangTeman to be disbursed as loans.

MSMEs collectively employ 97% of Indonesian workers and are key to the future of the nation’s development.Covid-19 dealt a major blow to these firms, with supply chain disruptions and low demand shuttering over 70% of these businesses either temporarily or permanently. As a result, the Indonesian economy spiraled into its first recession since the 1998 Asian financial crisis, triggering a wake up call for MSMEs to digitalize quickly to counter movement restrictions and fewer in-person transactions.A lifeline for MSMEsOver the course of the pandemic, digital platforms have proven to be a lifeline for MSMEs by allowing them to connect with the 21 million new digital customers who have come online.There has been a marked uptick in digitalized services in Indonesia. According to Google’s 2021 e-Conomy report, 98% of Indonesia’s digital merchants now accept digital payments, and more than half offer online lending solutions.“The pandemic has made us aware of the need to improve innovation, adaptation, and skills – not only by selling and making payments online, but also creating creative content so that business can continue to be sustainable,” Sandiaga Uno, Indonesia’s Minister of Tourism and Creative Economy (Menparekraf), said at a webinar organized by Indonesian e-wallet firm Dana in August 2021. He views the pandemic as a catalyst that could bring a sea change for MSMEs.Vince Iswara, Dana’s chief executive and co-founder, says the digitalization of MSME businesses is “inevitable,” and would create the “ability to avoid the risk of face-to-face payments and strengthen business opportunities to survive during these uncertain times.”Vince Iswara, CEO and co-founder of Dana / Photo credit: DanaHowever, although 13.7 million MSMEs entered Indonesia’s digital ecosystem amid the pandemic, Sandiaga noted that they only account for 12.5% of the entire industry, hinting at the huge potential for Dana’s digitalized payments platform to spur the economy’s development.Educating for a financially-inclusive Indonesia“Dana was built from our belief that technology is an enabler to move people forward including Indonesia,” says Iswara. “As a nation with a lot of potential and great resources, Indonesia still faces problems because we are divided by the ocean and land – it makes it impossible to move goods and transact easily.”Dana – named after the Bahasa Indonesia word for “funds” – sees the solution to the country’s geographical challenges in Dana’s vision of a “cashless society.” Founded in 2018, Dana’s app-based platform offers an all-in-one solution that allows customers and businesses to make and receive digital payments conveniently.“We are focused on becoming the bridge to all economic ecosystems,” says Iswara. “Especially by connecting more banked or underserved peoples for better access to financial technology and literacy.”Iswara calls these solutions “digital payments 4.0,” referencing the much-vaunted Industrial Revolution 4.0 that could pave a path for the future of business through technology and online platforms.Dana’s e-wallet offering is underpinned by educational initiatives and collaborative partnerships that aim to tackle some of Indonesia’s persistent societal challenges such as a lack of skilled talent, market access, and financial inclusion.For example, Dana Bisnis, the startup’s enterprise-facing offering, makes it easier for MSMEs to accept digital transactions through QR codes and keep records in real time. When the take-up of this technology rose sharply over the last year, Dana began offering complimentary education and training to help MSMEs make the most of its solutions. Dana has been able to connect to 14 million QRIS (Quick Response Code Indonesian Standard) merchants with the help of the standardized QR code from Bank Indonesia.“During the pandemic, we continued to provide assistance and training virtually to encourage optimal absorption of knowledge,” says Iswara. “As a result, the number of Dana Bisnis MSME partners has grown, as has their digital financial literacy.”Building a bridge for Indonesia’s unbankedDana’s aspirations for a “cashless society” have produced significant synergies between the startup and the Indonesian government, which launched its own “no cash” movement back in 2014. As a result, Dana’s initiatives contain an element of national service, which has gained steam as MSMEs struggle to recover from the pandemic.These struggles stem from a lack of access to basic financial services like bank accounts. Most MSMEs operate in an informal market that doesn’t require business registrations, which further complicates their access to credit lines and cash-based aid.“During the pandemic, we initiated our ‘Daftarkan Warung Sekitar Kamu’ program, in part to support the initiatives of the Ministry of Cooperatives and SMEs,” says Iswara. “This is a community-based initiative where users can help register a warung (a brick-and-mortar business) by using our app.”The registration campaign is part of the startup’s “Siap Siaga Covid-19” program – an umbrella initiative in collaboration with digital donation platform Kitabisa.com to raise donations from the general public to help pandemic-hit businesses.Despite its internet-savvy population, Indonesia is home to the world’s third-largest unbanked population. In order to combat this persistent issue, Dana collaborates with Women’s World Banking (WWB) – a nonprofit that promotes gender-sensitive financial inclusion – and local authorities to expand MSMEs’ access to digital financial services.Photo credit: Dana“Our WWB program aims to increase digital financial literacy, helping people to adapt to existing and emerging challenges for the welfare of their families,” Iswara says.Aside from facilitating access to financial aid, Dana has also helped MSMEs gain access to new markets and users by digitalizing the fundamentals of logistics, especially as lockdown policies have limited consumer movement.“With Bhanda Ghara Reksa Logistics, we launched our Miniservice Warung Pangan to help regular people access affordable food staples and empower MSMEs by opening up this market,” says Iswara.He also shares that through its Dana Delivery service, the startup enables brick-and-mortar MSMEs digitalize their logistics via a network of couriers to deliver goods to a wider pool of customers.Empowering the MSME through educationFrom an education standpoint, Dana has also played an active role in boosting skills of local MSME entrepreneurs. Through the Dana Academy, the startup has empowered more than 400,000 Dana Bisnis entrepreneurs with skills covering health and safety, business management, and digital marketing.“In Dana, our tech and capabilities allow us to go beyond making great fintech products, transferring knowledge and skills to improve the quality life of all Indonesians,” says Iswara.Photo credit: DanaHe adds that the startup’s Dana Untuk Negeri initiative enables its employees to volunteer with MSMEs in designated cities. For Iswara, these activities are key in building trust between Dana and its wider community.“This trust gives us the ability to remain in communication with our business partners to discuss and find solutions on how to continue to work in accordance with the current context, where health is a priority for all of us,” he says.Iswara also notes that Dana is “very optimistic” about the job opportunities for all Indonesians presented by Southeast Asia’s growing internet economy, especially in areas like food delivery and ecommerce.The focus, he says, will be on financially -underserved populations, taking advantage of the next two years of growth in the digital financial services sector.Dana’s open platform is designed to promote financial inclusion and literacy for MSMEs and customers all across Indonesia by reimagining the potential of the all-in-one digital wallet.To find out more how you can accelerate your business’s digitalization, download Dana’s app through this link.This content was produced by Tech in Asia Studios, which connects brands with Asia’s tech community.

733359,2022-02-18T01:00:51,2022-02-18T07:34:16,Exclusive: 🇮🇩 proptech firm bags funding from Sinar Mas unit,jendela360-series-a-funding,post,"Jendela360, an Indonesian proptech startup, has raised an undisclosed amount of series A funding from a subsidiary of Indonesian conglomerate Sinar Mas Group.(From left) Jendela360 founders Kiki Guzali, Daniel Rannu, and Ade Indra / Photo credit: Jendela360Founded in 2016, Jendela360 is a digital property brokerage that initially focused on long-term apartment rentals. It was one of the earliest startups in Indonesia that used 360-degree virtual tours to attract customers. About six months ago, it expanded into the property buying and selling business.The company was established by serial entrepreneur Daniel Rannu, former real estate advisor Kiki Guzali, and Ade Indra, who has experience in the hospitality business.According to a statement, Jendela360 saw a 4x growth in sales and revenue in the past 18 months amid the pandemic. “I can say that we are the largest offline-to-online proptech that handles buying and rental in Indonesia,” Rannu told Tech in Asia.Despite its quick growth, the firm said that it is operationally profitable.Jendela360 currently operates in the Jakarta and Tangerang areas and has around 95 employees. It plans to raise more funding soon to fuel nationwide expansion in the next two years.Riding the pandemic waveWhen the Covid-19 pandemic hit Indonesia, Rannu admitted that he was worried it would cause an armageddon for the country’s property industry. “We saw the travel industry going down. So I thought, ‘Who will buy property in this hard time?'” he recalled.Internally, the company’s sales went down by 30%, so Rannu decided to downsize the team, especially the marketing division. However, he soon realized that the pandemic would actually provide tailwinds for the industry.For instance, it pushed people to try digital solutions when looking for properties. “They have no option to come directly to the property, so our virtual tours feature is the best that they can use,” Rannu said.Other than that, property developers also adjusted to the health crisis by building real estate with “post-pandemic” designs, such as the availability of space to work and exercise from home.With the positive trend, Jendela360 moved to the property buying and selling business and offered shorter-term apartment rentals. The firm used to only process one-year rentals, but now it also accepts demands for three-month leases.Staying away from the marketplace modelBefore raising its series A round, Jendela360 had raised US$1.2 million from two rounds of funding. In 2018, it received seed funding from Prasetia Dwidharma and Everhaus, which was followed by a US$1 million pre-series A roundled by Beenext in 2020.The key to surviving with a smaller war chest, Rannu said, is the company’s business model, which focuses on the entire transaction – from negotiations to payments. This allows the firm to get higher margins as opposed to companies that employ the marketplace model, which connects customers with property agents and only gets revenue from subscription fees.Another advantage of facilitating the whole transaction is the abundance of data that Jendela360 can collect.“One interesting example is the fact that a landlord who has houses usually also has apartments that can be rented and shophouses that can be bought. Thus, the industry is actually connected,” Rannu shared. “If we can get and use the data, it can become our advantage.”According to the co-founder, this is one of the reasons he raised funding from an entity affiliated with the Sinar Mas Group, which is one of the largest property developers in the country.See also: Mapping the key players in Indonesian proptechMoving forward, Jendela360 plans to expand its property buying and selling business to the secondary markets by 2024. The Indonesian property secondary market is a 300 trillion rupiah (around US$21 billion) business, 3x larger than the primary market, said Rannu. He also believes that the market will continue to grow.“Indonesian people still have a conservative mindset. After renting an apartment for two to three years, they will have an intention to buy houses as their income also increases,” he concluded.",Indonesia-based Jendela360 saw 4x growth in sales and revenue in the past 18 months and claimed that it is operationally profitable.,86192,Aditya Hadi Pratama,True,Collin Furtado and Jaclyn Tiu,0,"['Investments', 'News', 'Premium Content', 'Startups']","['ade indra', 'daniel rannu', 'Funding', 'Indonesia', 'Jendela360', 'kiki guzali', 'proptech', 'proptech startups', 'Sinar Mas Group']",False,,True,True,True,False,3

This is the highest number of unicorns that the region has produced in a year – a feat it achieved despite the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. To put that figure into context, there were more Southeast Asian startups that entered the unicorn club in 2021 compared with the total number of new entrants in the seven years prior.Right now, there are 15 startups across the region that are already lined up to join the exclusive list, with valuations hovering at above US$500 million already.

The Tiger Global-led round saw participation from Alpha Wave Global, Kora Investment, DF International Partners, and Twenty Nine Capital Partners.According to the startup, the latest round brings its total funds raised to date to US$393 million, and it currently stands at a valuation of US$1.7 billion.Middle East and SEA in sightDealShare founder and CEO Vineet Rao told Tech in Asia that the company is preparing to expand its footprint overseas. It plans to start with markets in the Gulf Cooperation Council such as the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman, Kuwait, and Bahrain. It will soon set up an office in Abu Dhabi.The company plans to tap into Southeast Asia as well. Rao revealed that DealShare will initially roll out in Indonesia before expanding to other neighboring markets.Rao did not give a concrete timeline for the international rollout, but he said it may take up to six months as the company is setting up a team for this purpose.Moving toward profitabilityRao said that DealShare is aiming to break even in India by the end of the year.“We are finalizing our plans to identify key areas of investment that will help drive to operational profitability,” he added.Rao’s optimism is based on the fast-paced growth the company has recorded in recent months. He revealed that DealShare was managing about 200,000 square feet of warehousing at the beginning of last year, which has now grown to about 2.5 million square feet.See also: Can Shopee win in India?

This will be significantly higher than the nearly US$50 million ARR the company had at the beginning of 2021.“We are likely to hit US$3 billion of gross revenue run rate in the next 12 months. We will be tripling our geographical presence, investing heavily on acquiring top-notch tech talent, and building world-class supply chain infrastructure to aid this growth along with a continued focus on capital efficiency and path to profitability,” Sourjyendu Medda, DealShare co-founder and chief business officer, said in a statement.See also: The Pinduoduo model takes hold in India  DealShare is also looking to diversify its product portfolio to add general merchandise – primarily focused on fashion and electronics – and fresh produce categories.

Rao hopes the newer categories will soon contribute up to 40% of the company’s total revenues.DealShare’s rise comes at a time when the social commerce space in India is growing at a rapid pace. According to a Bain &amp; Company report, social commerce in India is expected to be worth up to US$20 billion in total gross merchandise value by 2025 and hit between US$60 billion and US$70 billion by 2030.Already, Facebook-backed Meesho has become a dominant force in the industry.

Delivered every Thursday via email and through the Tech in Asia website, this free newsletter breaks down the biggest stories and trends in ecommerce. If you’re not a subscriber, get access by registering here.Hi there,Privilege hit me hard across the face the other day when a parcel arrived and I couldn’t,for the life of me, remember what I had ordered. In an age when deliveries come thick and fast, it can be easy to lose track of things that are not a priority.My colleague Samreen found out that it can take newer entrants in India’s ecommerce space (read: Shopee) over a week to get packages delivered. But those who value discounts and bargains over speed might want to give Shopee a shot after reading Samreen’s report on Shopee’s foray into India.I can’t help but wonder if Forrest Li, the chairman and CEO of Sea Group, has a world map in his office to mark all the markets Shopee has ventured into, and the places he’d like for it to go.But the path to global domination won’t be easy, given the challenges coming Shopee’s way, as Simon writes in this week’s Big Story. When Shopee was still up and coming, its growth was aided by the fact that Alibaba-owned Lazada had its own troubles. But that seems to be a thing of the past. Besides, Indonesia’s GoTo is also proving to be a strong contender in the region.Shopee doesn’t want to leave anything to chance: It quietly launched a food delivery business in Indonesia in 2021 and is rapidly expanding in other countries. But as Simon explains, this expansion also comes with risks.— NikitaTHE BIG STORYWhat could go wrong for Shopee?Image credit: Timmy LoenShopee dominates ecommerce in Southeast Asia, but it can’t afford to rest easy as the competition gets fierce and its rapid expansion carries risks.THE HOT TAKEWhy India’s q-commerce firms are turning to private labelsImage credit: ZeptoHere’s what happened:Two of India’s leading quick commerce firms, Swiggy’s Instamart and Zepto, are set to launch private labels.Zepto plans to sell staples, general merchandise, and cooking essentials under its own brand by the second or third quarter of this year.Swiggy’s Instamart will introduce its first private label through cleaning supplies next month.Here’s our take:Tapioca, sweet potato, banana, or perhaps jackfruit? The mom and pop store down my street has plenty of chips to choose from, including a shelf of unbranded packets. His wife made these, he says. “These are cheaper and better.”Launching private labels is a road well traveled. For instance, Amazon sports a number of private labels, including AmazonBasics.But private labels in the hyperlocal delivery space are a relatively new trend, though several of Instamart and Zepto’s competitors – like Reliance Retail-backed Dunzo – already have their brands in place. At least two quick commerce companies in the US – Gopuff and Buyk – launched their private brands this January.Despite the thrill of having ice creams, groceries, and plant pots being delivered quicker as superfast deliveries become the norm, the spotlight remains firmly on the trend’s economic sustainability. Margins in the grocery delivery space are notoriously wafer thin.This is where private labels offer the proverbial ray of hope. Selling in-house products can make for fatter margins than expensive third-party brands. Zepto’s Aadit Palicha says that its private labels will add 3% to the firm’s operating earnings margin.At Milkbasket, another grocery delivery firm, private labels contributed 20% to 22% of the startup’s revenue in 2020. Acquired by Reliance Retail in late 2021, the startup expected those numbers to double as it added more private labels.At least one company, however, is going against the grain.BlinkIt (previously known as Grofers), backed by Softbank and Zomato, had experimented with private labels as far back as 2016. A few years down the line, private labels made up as much as 50% of BlinkIt’s gross merchandise value. But as the firm pivoted to quick commerce late last year, it scaled down its private labels.For representation purposes only / Image credit: 123rf.comWhile it’s unclear why BlinkIt did this, private labels have their own set of challenges, including manufacturing, quality control, and consumer perception. The last is of particular concern because in-house brands being markedly cheaper than premium-priced products might suggest that the former are inferior in quality.Southeast Asia’s consumer segments, demographically similar to India’s, are willing to try new brands across categories, according to a recent report by McKinsey. With price tags of private label brands being 10% to 20% lower than national brands, the McKinsey report says such brands increased margins for firms over a five-year period.Palicha believes the trick for successful private labels is to choose categories where customers have the least amount of brand loyalty and can be easily swapped with substitutes.But the road to promising revenues is paved with speed bumps – the latest being reservations from the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT). The trade organization has been asking for a tighter leash on ecommerce.Ecommerce marketplaces shouldn’t own brands or create private labels, says CAIT’s Praveen Khandelwal. The argument comes at a time when India is finalizing its policy on ecommerce.CAIT says marketplaces should be neutral and treat all sellers on an equal footing. Across platforms, private labels are often displayed more prominently than others.The stakes are high in the tussle between the CAIT and ecommerce portals – India’s quick commerce market is expected to touch US$5 billion by 2025, according to a RedSeer report.That said, business isn’t as forgiving as Wordle. The quick commerce firms may not get many chances to get private labels just right.— NikitaNEWS YOU SHOULD KNOWCheck out Tech in Asia’s coverage of the ecommerce scene here.1️⃣ Reebelo, a Singapore-based online marketplace for refurbished products, has raised US$20 million in a round that also saw participation from Lazada co-founder Maximilian Bittner.

Across the region, new fintech firms, tech companies, and incumbent banks are launching digital banking services in place of physical branches.Vietnam is no exception, and digital banks have plenty of potential to make a difference in the country. It is home to a young population – one that seeks flexible and efficient digital services and solutions, and while 70% of Vietnamese adults do have a bank account, many of them remain underserved and lack access to other financial products such as investments and credit.A fruit vendor in Ho Chi Minh City / Photo credit: 123rfPlus, the nation’s central bank approved electronic know-your-customer (eKYC) processes in 2020 to allow users to open of bank accounts online, making it easier for citizens to set up bank accounts and reap the benefits of banking.Despite these developments, digital banks haven’t had an easy time in the country.A challenging marketUnlike other markets in Southeast Asia such as Singapore and Indonesia, which have launched digital bank licenses for non-banking players, Vietnam’s regulations for digital banks are not clearly defined. This means that any startup looking to launch a digital bank has to partner up with an existing bank, which can slow down the process significantly.“It commonly takes six months to a year for a traditional bank to develop new products and services, due to all the processes and guidelines involved,” says Nguyen Huu Quang, CEO of Cake, the digital banking arm of Be Group, which operates Vietnamese ride-hailing service Be.Nguyen Huu Quang, CEO of Cake / Photo credit: CakeWhile Vietnam has a young population, many are hesitant about digital banking services, citing concerns such as identity theft and security. Financial literacy in Vietnam is still low, which makes it difficult for banks to get users to use services beyond opening a savings account.Navigating roadblocksCake is one digital bank that’s rising to the challenge of serving Vietnam’s underbanked consumers. Launched in 2021 as a joint venture between Be Group and VPBank, Cake aims to be a “simple, trusted, and delightful bank” that brings greater financial inclusion to Vietnamese citizens by making digital banking via mobile phones easy and accessible.According to Nguyen, Cake seemed like a natural extension of what Be Group aims to do with its mobility services: bringing convenience to its users. The firm worked with VPBank, which is one of Vietnam’s largest lenders, to develop the Cake platform, using the incumbent’s expertise and experience to build its framework. It then worked with fintech firms to accelerate the development process.Photo credit: CakeCake worked closely with cloud banking platform Mambu to develop a full suite of banking services like those of established banks.Cake opted to use Mambu’s cloud solutions as the basis of its core banking system – the back-end technologies involved in key banking activities such as account opening and transactions processing. By using cloud banking, Cake can launch new services within weeks, where traditional core banking systems took years. Additionally, it transformed its core banking system in just 74 days – a record in Asia.Cake also inked a partnership with payments solutions firm Radar Payments to develop its end-to-end payments infrastructure.“With the help of these fintech firms, it only takes one to two months to deliver new products to customers,” shares Nguyen. “This allows us to invest more into the people, products, and marketing behind Cake, instead of on the development process.”Getting customers on boardCustomer acquisition remains a significant challenge for digital banks, but Cake’s connection with Be Group helped it overcome this barrier. The digital bank saved on customer acquisition costs as it already had a large pool of potential customers from the drivers and users who use Be Group’s ride-hailing services and trust its technology.Cake focused on integrating its platform with the Be app, enabling drivers and customers to seamlessly make payments on Be via Cake. Be Group ecosystem’s also added value to Cake’s offerings, giving customers access to services such as ride hailing, hotel bookings, and even insurance.“Through this, Cake was able to offer clients financial services and smooth payments, as well as a rapid and secure experience throughout the pandemic,” adds Nguyen.The firm also has staff to guide users through setting up an account on Cake, navigating the eKYC process, and understanding the digital bank’s offerings.Cake is also aware of the fact that Vietnam’s tech-savvy youth are a large segment of its target audience. That’s why the firm positioned itself as “more than a banking service,” adding small but significant features to draw in the younger generation.For example, the bank, in partnership with MasterCard, offers its customers an international debit card in colors and designs that appeal to young consumers. It also lets users add creative elements to transactions.Photo credit: Cake“Cake aims to boost engagement in each transaction – for example, when you make a transfer, you can add emojis or message cards to the transaction, showing off your creativity,” says Nguyen. “This helps meet the demands of young customers for creative offerings, and shows that Cake is more than just a financial product – it’s also a platform to send messages, express sentiments, and develop trust.”These approaches have served Cake well: The firm had 1 million customers on its platform by the end of 2021 – within just 11 months of operation – and is looking to roll out even more offerings, including microfinancing solutions, in 2022.“We set a goal of having one million users at the beginning of 2021, and we achieved it despite it being extremely challenging,” shares Nguyen. “By investing in technology infrastructure and having quick and flexible leadership, we were able to achieve this.”To a digitally-banked futureAs the Covid-19 pandemic continues to drive digitalization and bring more people into the digital economy, Nguyen is confident that digital banks – and fintech as a whole – will flourish in Vietnam.In his view, there will be greater collaboration between banks and fintech firms, and technology like AI and big data will help change the way people bank.“The industry will be producing new financial products quicker and more affordably,” he says. “The Covid-19 pandemic has fundamentally altered user behavior, and the digital economy will continue to expand dramatically in the near term – digital transformation is inevitable.”Cake is a Vietnam-based digital bank launched by Be Group and VPBank that aims to make banking easy and accessible.Learn more about Cake here.This content was produced by Tech in Asia Studios, which connects brands with Asia’s tech community.

733193,2022-02-17T01:55:42,2022-02-16T15:45:53,What could go wrong for Shopee?,wrong-shopee,post,"Monday was a big day for Sea Group.Shareholders at its annual general meeting approved changes that further entrench Forrest Li’s control over the company, giving the chairman and CEO 57% of total voting power – more than double his 25% economic interest.Such arrangements are common in founder-led companies, and Li – along with Chris Feng, CEO of ecommerce arm Shopee – has steered Sea to become a leading global consumer internet player.Photo credit: 123rf.com/stlegatBut what should have been a day of celebration for Li ended with Sea’s New York Stock Exchange-listed shares dropping by a whopping 18%. This was due to reports that Free Fire – the best-selling game of Sea’s digital entertainment unit, Garena – was included in a list of apps to be banned in India. The government is moving to restrict apps that are deemed to be of Chinese origin, saying that they pose a threat to India’s national security.Investors fear that this ban could be extended to include Shopee, which would deal a further blow to Sea’s global aspirations.Despite the sizable dip in Sea’s share price recently, institutional analysts remain enthusiastic about its prospects. Nine out of 10 recommend buying the stock, with none rating it as underweight or sell. (The recommendations haven’t accounted for the recent India-related news, though.)See also: How Shopee made its bid for SEA’s ecommerce crownSome independent analysts like Julian Lin, however, are less sanguine. Lin writes for Seeking Alpha, a provider of crowd-sourced investment content, and he doubts Shopee’s ability to sustain solid margins in the long term.This is a contrarian view that we’ll be exploring in detail.Revitalized competitorsAlong with Garena and financial services unit SeaMoney, Shopee is one of Sea’s three main pillars and dominates ecommerce in Southeast Asia.Shopee’s early days coincided with a period of turmoil at Alibaba-owned Lazada, which was then poised to capture the region’s ecommerce market.But Lazada seems to have left its troubles behind. In late 2021, Alibaba announced an executive reshuffling that saw Jiang Fan, who previously led its flagship Taobao and Tmall divisions, heading a new international digital commerce division that includes Lazada and AliExpress.A Lazada warehouse in Thailand / Photo credit: LazadaIn a presentation at Alibaba’s 2021 Investor Day, Lazada Group CEO Chun Li committed to boosting the company’s gross merchandise value from US$21 billion to US$100 billion. However, he didn’t specify a timeframe for this fivefold growth.This is significant because it was the first time that the Hangzhou-headquartered titan revealed separate numbers for Lazada. Tightening regulatory pressures in China have made other markets, especially Southeast Asia, more important to Alibaba.“Up until recently, the management of Lazada has just been a rotating queue of people flown in from Hangzhou for 12 months,” observes Jeffrey Towson, a technology equity investor and professor at Sasin School of Management in Bangkok. “They know they gave [Shopee] a huge opening. That is probably the thing they’re fixing.”Another competitor to watch is Indonesia’s GoTo, which was formed after the merger between tech giants Gojek and Tokopedia. GoTo’s much-anticipated IPO is expected to happen as early as this quarter.Tokopedia and Shopee have been competing neck and neck in Indonesia for years. While Shopee has the leading app, Tokopedia’s website was the most visited in Q3 2021.See also: Why Shopee and Lazada dominate local players – but not TokopediaIn its home turf of Indonesia – also Southeast Asia’s largest market – GoTo can leverage Gojek’s wider range of goods and services, which outnumber what Shopee offers. On the delivery front, Gojek’s fleet of drivers can strengthen Tokopedia’s last-mile capabilities.“The No. 1 synergy is consumers,” says Towson. “You have more activity by consumers. You can link your two apps together. You can cross-sell. That decreases your marketing costs.”If GoTo’s IPO proceeds this year, it will also alleviate any capital-related challenges, enabling Tokopedia to continue fending off Shopee in Indonesia.Ng Weiyi, assistant professor of strategy and policy at the National University of Singapore (NUS) Business School, notes that platforms are “fighting for consumers’ limited mindshare.” As a result of the merger, Tokopedia has “the potential to reach and convert Gojek’s extensive user base” in addition to leveraging the super app’s “logistical prowess.”Photo credit: TokopediaBy offering consumers a convenient way to scratch their shopping itch, Tokopedia can eat into the time they spend on Shopee.However, Shopee also moves fast. To plug the gaps in its offerings, it quietly entered Indonesia’s food delivery scene in April 2021. As Tech in Asia noted in an analysis of this development, the move “can increase the app’s stickiness, and in turn, inspire more users to shop on its ecommerce platform.”The popularity of social commerceDespite the rise of marketplaces, social channels remain indispensable to Southeast Asia’s consumers, who prefer to chat directly with buyers and settle payments upon delivery.In the first half of 2021, Taiwan-based AI solutions provider iKala surveyed consumers in Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand, and found that 78% already use social media to shop. This is second only to ecommerce platforms (91%).US-based Meta’s family of apps – Facebook, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram – are widely popular in Southeast Asia, and Towson thinks it’s a “sleeping giant” that could be the “biggest existential threat” to Shopee’s position in the region.However, Meta has been slow to leverage its strengths in this area. “They have the most under-utilized assets,” Towson tells Tech in Asia. He added that if Tencent – the Chinese tech major that operates super app WeChat – owned WhatsApp, “this game would have been over five years ago.”NUS associate professor Ng shares the same sentiment. Sellers obviously want to be on Shopee to access a large number of customers, but the platform is not their only option. “If I can find my own customers somewhere else, at a much lower cost, I’m going to do that. The rise of direct selling through social media and messaging reflects this,” he points out.With other options to reach customers directly, it could be hard for Shopee to increase its take rate.This dovetails with the position of Lin, the independent analyst who is bearish on Shopee. He questions whether “take rate expansion will affect [Shopee’s] ability to grow and retain market share, considering that its growth has come from undercutting on price, aggressive sales promotions, and its competitors are not to be underestimated.”The risks of breakneck expansionShopee’s expenses are expected to continue rising as the company ventures into new markets and segments.Sea isn’t content with Shopee being No. 1 in Southeast Asia. In addition to Latin America and India, Shopee has also expanded into Europe and most recently, South Korea.Can Sea sustain this growth momentum?First, the sheer number of new markets to manage raises the risk that Shopee will lose focus in its core markets, which are heterogeneous and have a unique mix of competitors.See also: Brazil could become Shopee’s biggest market, beating even IndonesiaLin argues that because many of Shopee’s markets are relatively small in size but have high population densities, they have “very low” barriers to entry. As such, they provide incumbents with less of an advantage than Amazon has in the US.Towson concurs, saying that while “Shopee might take its eye off the ball,” he thinks that the company is a “natural-born multinational.” That’s why “going to Poland and Latin America is no different” from what Shopee did five years ago, when it expanded beyond Singapore and ventured into other Southeast Asian markets.Even as Shopee has extended its geographic reach, its average order size has been falling.While that suggests consumers are buying online more frequently, the number will have to go up over time for Shopee to be financially sustainable.Second, Shopee’s rapid expansion and increasing size could spark pushback from incumbents and regulators.For example, it has faced scrutiny from consumer groups in Malaysia and the Philippines as well as a trade group in India.Following news of the Indian government banning Garena, the Confederation of All India Traders renewed its call for Shopee to be banned.While the possibility of an outright ban is India-specific, escalating geopolitical tensions and the perception that Sea is a Chinese company may expose it to further attacks as it ventures into new markets.Garena’s slowing growthShopee’s success so far has been enabled by the positive returns generated by its sister firm, digital entertainment player Garena.In the most recent 12-month period (Q4 2020 to Q3 2021), Shopee had a negative adjusted EBITDA of US$2.1 billion. This amount was covered by the US$2.8 billion of EBITDA made in the same period by Garena.However, Garena’s growth has been on a decline. The growth in quarterly active users and bookings for Q3 2021 was the slowest of the previous 11 quarters. This may feed into sluggish future EBITDA growth, which will hamper Garena’s ability to subsidize losses at Shopee.With US$12.5 billion of cash on its balance sheet, Sea certainly has the resources to absorb a significant period of losses.But ecommerce is not the only area that will need funding as Sea also has big plans for financial services. Tech in Asia made some calculations, and we estimate that SeaMoney lost over US$600 million in the most recent 12-month period. Moreover, its digital banking ambitions will require even higher levels of investment.Fiercer competition in ecommerce and a reduced ability to make the required investment via profits from Garena will push Sea to raise more funding from the market. However, such a move would come with its own set of problems.Photo credit: GarenaSea’s share price, like those of other fast-growing tech companies, has been battered by expectations that the Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policy in response to high inflation levels in the US. This has contributed to a 42% year-to-date drop in its shares, which are down by over 60% from their peak in November 2021 (as of February 14).A lower share price will not directly impact Shopee’s business. However, it does mean that Sea’s existing shareholders will have to suffer a greater level of dilution in order to raise the same amount of money, compared to if the share price was higher.Shopee has gone from strength to strength, so it isn’t easy to envisage a situation where it finds itself on the backfoot. But it’s set to face some growing pains in the coming years.The same applies to its parent firm. As Li pointed out at the annual shareholders’ meeting, Sea has been in business for only 12 years. “We’re still a young kid,” the CEO and chairman reportedly added.","Shopee dominates ecommerce in Southeast Asia, but it can’t afford to rest easy as the competition gets fierce and its rapid expansion carries risks.",246160,Simon Huang,True,"Thu Huong Le, Terence Lee, and Eileen C.

Informative and witty, it gives you everything you need to know to start your day. Choose the Daily Newsletter option to get it  delivered to your inbox or read it right here on our site.Hello reader,Most of my work days begin with a barrage of fintech-related news. I couldn’t avoid it, even if I wanted to. Whether it’s funding, mergers, or insolvency, the space is abuzz with interest. This is understandable given the countless consumer-facing apps that offer convenient financial solutions and seem to be appearing from thin air.Fintech is often seen as a recent marriage of financial services and IT. That’s what led me to assume that fintech came to the fore only in the early 2010s (how did I forget about ATMs? 🏧), along with the onset of the smartphone invasion of the world. In fact, fintech has evolved over three distinct time periods, dating all the way back to 1886.With e-wallets apps across Southeast Asia grabbing most of the headlines, it is easy to forget just how broad and diverse the fintech sector is. Its sheer vastness also helps explain the flood of fintech news. Earned wage access, credit scoring, SME financing, digital lending, insurtech, personal finance, point-of-sale firms, and buy now, pay later all fall under the fintech umbrella.As the benefits of fintech trickle deep into every Southeast Asian market, in our premium story today, we take a detailed look at the shifting landscape of Vietnam’s fintech sector, which attracted over half a billion dollars in investments last year.Today we look at:The key players in Vietnam’s fintech battlegroundThe latest 🦄 in the BNPL spaceOther newsy highlights such as funding rounds across a diverse set of industries, and India’s ban on Garena’s Free FireAlso, if you’re an entrepreneur looking for funding, fill out this form to get your company featured on our list of fundraising startups.Premium summaryVietnam’s fintech bullsImage credit: Timmy LoenEven without a clear legal framework guiding Vietnam’s fintech sector, investors remain bullish on its potential, pouring more than US$580 million into this space in 2021 alone. A major contributor was the country’s fintech darling, MoMo, which became a unicorn after its US$200 million series E round led by Japan’s Mizuho Bank in December 2021.Origins of SEA’s next super app?: MoMo has cornered more than half the market share in Vietnam’s payments space and is now aiming to become a fintech super app, drawing from the strategies of WeChat and Alipay. To that end, MoMo has added financial services such as credit scoring, savings, and BNPL to its platform.Deep-pocketed competition: Commercial banks and telecom operators have moved swiftly to offer digital financial products. In fact, most of their payment apps rank highly in both downloads and active users. Unlike fintech companies, which constantly have to raise funds, commercial banks have far greater resources. In 2021, two of Vietnam’s major commercial banks, Vietcombank and Techcombank, both hit the billion-dollar profit milestone.Space to grow: Most users in Vietnam still haven’t used fintech platforms, apart from digital payment services, for their other financial needs. Additionally, a large chunk of the population remains outside the traditional banking system, leaving room for further disruption, especially in categories such as digital lending to individuals and small businesses.Read more: The key players in Vietnam’s fintech battlegroundStartup spotlightBNPL’s latest 🦄It seems the troubles of BNPL firms in Australia has done little to stop VC firms and other investors from pouring funds into these startups in Southeast Asia. BNPL in the region is still in its infancy, with the trend gaining significant momentum only in the past year. IPO-bound Akulaku has become the latest in the long line of Southeast Asia’s BNPL beneficiaries.A coveted club: Akulaku has raised US$100 million in a series E round from Thailand-based Siam Commercial Bank. After the round, Akulaku’s valuation rose to between US$1.5 billion and US$2 billion, and the firm entered the unicorn club, a source close to the company told Tech in Asia. The company raised US$125 million in funding in 2021.Meeting targets ✅: During the first half of 2021, the fintech firm posted a revenue of US$274 million, a 150% surge from the same period in 2020. The source added that the company had hit the US$600 million revenue mark in 2021, meeting its forecast. Half the startup’s revenue came from BNPL and the other half from cash loans.An IPO in the offing?: Earlier this year, Indonesia-based Akulaku was reportedly in talks for a US listing this year via a merger with Catcha Investment Corp, a special purpose acquisition company set up by Patrick Grove, Catcha group’s co-founder. Akulaku is expected to raise between US$200 million and US$300 million in the process.Quick bytes1️⃣ For a piece of mind(Fi)MindFi, a Singapore-based mental health and wellness platform, has raised US$2 million in seed funding from M Venture Partners and Global Founders Capital, as well as from Carousell co-founder Marcus Tan, Carro executive Kenji Narushima, and Spin co-founder Derrick Ko.MindFi said it has tripled its employees and increased annual revenue growth by 5x since September 2021.

Delivered every Wednesday via email and through the Tech in Asia website, this free newsletter breaks down the biggest stories and trends in fintech. If you’re not a subscriber, get access by registering here.Hello there,In Bahasa Indonesian, the word ajaib means magical or miraculous.That may be why an Indonesian startup by the same name has achieved great feats in a short span of time.Stock trading startup Ajaib became the country’s latest unicorn — within just 2.5 years — making it the second fastest to achieve the milestone after payments platform Ovo.The venture capital world expects Ajaib to become as big as US-based Robinhood, one of the pioneers of online stock trading.As Indonesia wakes up to the new hobby of stock trading via apps, several others apart from Ajaib have joined the rush to grab a piece of the flourishing market.These include names such as Stockbit and Pluang, as well as Indonesia’s major banks and asset managers that offer apps alongside their in-house services.While it’s worth noting that Indonesia’s 2.7 million stock investors make up only about 1% of the country’s population, the growing interest from the younger generation, especially millennials and Gen Z, is making it a hot industry.In today’s big story, my colleague Jofie Yordan dives deep into the bullish world of Indonesia’s stock trading sector. Read on to know more.— SamreenTHE BIG STORYAjaib, Stockbit drive Indonesia’s stock-trading boomImage credit: Timmy LoenAjaib, for one, became a unicorn in just 2.5 years. But rivals – including more diversified newcomers – are reaching for a slice of the pie.THE HOT TAKEInvestor interest in Philippine fintech heats upHere’s what happened:Singapore-headquartered Tonik, a neobank operating in the Philippines, raised US$131 million in a series B round Japanese megabank Mizuho led the round Tonik is one of six applicants that was granted a digital bank license in the Philippines Here’s our take:Fintech investors in Southeast Asia look to Indonesia as a potential gold mine.The problem is that the space is getting crowded – there are at least 14 digital banks either in operation or awaiting a license to operate. The market is big enough to accommodate several players, but competition is likely to be intense.Investors who cast their eyes across the sea will find that the Philippines, another Southeast Asian archipelago, has many of the same qualities that make Indonesia such an attractive market for fintech companies.See also: Banking on a digital remedy in the PhilippinesBoth countries have large populations, many of whom remain unbanked or underbanked, with similar income levels, and room for greater urbanization that will drive demand for financial services.Image credit: Timmy LoenThe digital banking opportunity in the Philippines may actually be superior to Indonesia because the country’s central bank, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, has capped the number of digibank licenses to six and will keep it there for now.For companies like Tonik who have received a license, this gives them an advantage compared to financial service operators in Indonesia, where there is no such cap.These strong macro tailwinds have become apparent in Tonik’s US$131 million round, which is large by Southeast Asian standards especially for a company still at an early stage of fundraising.The investment is also a vote of confidence in Tonik’s CEO and founder, Greg Krasnov, who has experience with fintech in emerging markets. Notably, he founded Platinum Bank in Ukraine, which he led to an exit in 2014 for US$150 million, according to his LinkedIn profile.But in 2017, Platinum Bank’s fortunes took a turn for the worse – it was declared insolvent by the National Bank of Ukraine and shut its doors that year. We can assume that this was not an issue for investors in Tonik, who include big names like Sequoia and Point72, as well as Mizuho.Tonik, which in December announced that it had attracted US$100 million in consumer deposits within eight months of its launch, will be competing against digital banks backed by some of the biggest names in the Philippines, including the Aboitiz and Gokongwei families and telecom giant PLDT.How will Tonik, which doesn’t seem to have the same level of local backing, navigate a path forward? What unique advantages does it bring to the table? Will it aim to attract customers who are interested in higher-margin products like insurance and investments? These are some of the questions that need to be answered.— SimonNEWS YOU SHOULD KNOWCheck out Tech in Asia’s coverage of the fintech scene here.1️⃣ Exclusive: Bukalapak co-founders back 🇮🇩 B2B fintech startup amid funding spree: The investment in Monit marks Init 6’s third funding this year, following a quietly prolific 2021 for the Indonesia-based VC firm.2️⃣ YC-backed 🇮🇳 fintech unicorn enters SEA: Razorpay has acquired a majority stake in Curlec, a Malaysian fintech firm, for an undisclosed amount.Razorpay founders Harshil Mathur and Shashank Kumar / Image credit: Razorpay3️⃣ This fintech firm’s fight with its founder may end in a courtroom: After alleged boardroom battles and claims of fraud, BharatPe’s board and its co-founder Ashneer Grover could be embroiled in a legal tussle.4️⃣ Blockchain deals boost SG fintech funding to highest in 5 years: report: Fintech funding in Singapore reached nearly US$4 billion in 2021 as investments in the crypto and blockchain space continued to rise, noted a KPMG report.FYI1️⃣ Why Vietnam’s fintech battleground is shifting gear: More than half a billion dollars was invested into the country’s fintech sector in 2021.That’s it for this edition – we hope you liked it!

Investors in the fundraise also include JAFCO Asia and 500 Global.Team AmazingTalker / Photo credit: AmazingTalkerAmazingTalker runs a tutor-matching platform focused on language learning. Students can browse the company’s roster of instructors and choose one based on their preferences, though they can also opt to change to another teacher if they are not satisfied with the training they’ve received.The firm, which promises a better profit-sharing system for its instructors, also offers K-12 education services for children.AmazingTalker co-founder and CEO Abner Chao told Tech in Asia that he started the platform in 2016 with an objective to make online English-language learning more accessible and to empower teachers to make more income from online lessons.At the time, online programs for English cost up to 200,000 Taiwanese dollars (US$7,000), making them an unaffordable option for many people, he added.Chao also pointed out that the online English learning market was then dominated by online education firm TutorABC, which set the fees that tutors could charge. Chao had previously worked at the company as a sales manager.Over the years, AmazingTalker received a positive response, he said. To date, it has nearly 8,000 registered tutors and 1.1 million registered users and has clocked in 5.5 million online course reservations.See also:Why Indian edtech’s self-regulation move won’t stop govt interventionAccording to the CEO, Taiwan and Hong Kong cumulatively account for 60% of its total user base, though nearly 8% to 10% of users are from the US.

The firm will also expand its business in Southeast Asia, Japan, Korea, Europe, and North America.Chao said that the company will tailor its services to newer markets as well.

732937,2022-02-16T05:00:15,2022-02-21T04:18:31,Can Shopee win in India?,shopee-win-india,post,"In India, a black T-shirt from Shopee, the ecommerce arm of Southeast Asia’s internet giant Sea Group, can cost something like 149 rupees (US$1.98). But the array of discount vouchers and promotions on the platform can bring the price down significantly.Photo credit: ShopeeThe only drawback: Packages take over a week to be delivered, which is long considering ecommerce has entered the superfast lane all over the world.But if Shopee targets customers who value money more than delivery speed, then it has a huge audience in India, Santosh Pai, partner at law firm Link Legal, tells Tech in Asia.“There are millions of first-time customers in Tier 2 and Tier 3 who are willing to wait for 10 days for a parcel and save money with deep discounts that a platform like Shopee offers,” he points out.The ecommerce giant entered India silently in November last year, without any big campaigns before its launch. That said, it definitely looks to be invested in the vast ecommerce opportunity in India.According to a RedSeer report, the Covid-19 pandemic has added tailwinds to the country’s ecommerce sector, with the market opportunity likely to top US$140 billion by 2025.And in 2020, for the first time in India, over 50% of online shoppers were from Tier 2 cities. This means ecommerce is increasingly reaching the length and breadth of India and is ripe for the taking by companies who can crack the country’s supply chain.Shopee’s India planDuring Sea’s Q3 earnings call in November, group CEO Forest Li spoke about the ecommerce firm’s expansion plans, including in India.“From time to time, we may test the waters in new markets where we believe there may be an opportunity to use our experience in a highly diverse environment to reach underserved buyers and sellers,” he said at the time.However, Shopee’s India initiative seems to go beyond just testing the waters.Quickly after its rollout in November last year, the Shopee app has seen over 20 million downloads in India, according to Sensor Tower data. For perspective, local ecommerce firms Meesho and Flipkart netted over 160 million and 115 million downloads in 2021, respectively.However, according to App Annie data, Shopee was the second most downloaded shopping app in India for the months of December 2021 and January 2022, coming in just after Meesho.﻿Shopee is also charging zero commissions from merchants in India for now, which would undoubtedly attract more sellers on the app. As of January, the platform already has over 20,000 sellers in India. This, of course, may change over time, as Shopee currently charges 12% to 18% commissions in Brazil, a country it has already made its mark on.The ecommerce titan has a strong track record in applying its playbook in ASEAN and Brazil as well, and it wouldn’t be a stretch to say that it may be applying the same game plan in India, assuming that the company has long-term aspirations in the country.See also: How Shopee made its bid for SEA’s ecommerce crownShopee has not responded to an email sent by Tech in Asia seeking details of its India strategy.In only a year, the company stepped up local hiring efforts in Brazil and formed a team of 250 people while working with local sellers.In India, where it has only been operational for a few months, the company already has a team of 300 people and has hired a head of operations in the country. It has nearly 30,000 employees globally as of now.The company currently has over 60 openings for its India business on LinkedIn, mostly for seller communications, business management, and campaign management roles.On the logistics side, Shopee is likely to continue to partner with third-party logistics service providers to serve seller and buyer communities.Shopee has announced it is stepping up efforts to shorten delivery times in Malaysia / Photo credit: ShopeeMoving forward, Shopee’s India app will offer a mix of community buying experiences, livestreaming, and video content features, a source with direct knowledge of the matter tells Tech in Asia. Advertising is another frontier that could help Shopee garner success in India. Ecommerce platforms typically possess large amounts of data on consumers, so advertisers would have no problem leveraging this data to target users.See also: Sea: The next advertising powerhouse?The app is already allowing buyers to directly chat with sellers on the platform, and it’s been experimenting with daily promotions, deep discounts, free shipping and cashback offers in India.Shopee vs. Amazon India?Despite Shopee’s early wins in India, its larger goals are still unclear. According to Sutradhar co-founder and former Forrester senior forecast analyst Satish Meena, Shopee is here to capture the untapped ecommerce market that Amazon and Flipkart, the two biggest ecommerce players in the country, have so far not been able to breach.“Shopee is not here to compete with Flipkart or Amazon. They are here to attract new customers who are coming online for the first time and are looking to make small ticket-size purchases,” Meena tells Tech in Asia.Currently, India has the third-largest online shopper pool in the world – roughly 150 million people – after the US and China. This user base is expected to swell to 500 million by 2030, according to a report.If its goal is truly to capture first-time users, Shopee’s nearest competitors would be companies like social commerce platform Meesho and ecommerce player Snapdeal, which are tapping into the aspirations of people in Tier 2 and Tier 3 towns, Meena adds. Both Snapdeal and Meesho target price-sensitive customers and sell lesser-known brands in categories such as home, apparel, and beauty.Meesho office / Photo credit: MeeshoThe two firms also give importance to regional languages when reaching out to non-English-speaking customers.Currently, 83% of Snapdeal users prefer Hindi while talking to customer services agents, and 14% choose a vernacular language. Shopee is currently available in Hindi and English in India.Snapdeal, meanwhile, already sees more than 80% of its transactions come from small towns. For Meesho, more than 70% of its new customers hail from Tier 3 areas.Interestingly, a MoneyControl report published in November last year pointed out that Meesho clocks in 2 million orders per day, while both Amazon and Flipkart combined serve 2.5 million daily orders. Companies like Meesho have tie-ups with almost all the biggest logistics networks in India, who value the volume of products more than their price tag, which could be key to how the firm handles the large volume of parcels ordered on its platform, the report noted.While Shopee doesn’t have a first-mover advantage in India, it has strong experience in dealing with users who shop on smartphones in Southeast Asia. This will help it build its case in India, where smartphones have reached over 700 million people.Bumps on the roadWhile Shopee has garnered a large following in India in a short span of time, its cart is filling up with controversies.Free Fire, a game produced by Sea Group gaming arm Garena that has an immense fan following in India, has just been banned by the government. It’s one of 53 other “China-linked” apps that have recently been blocked.By this logic, even Shopee could come under the ban radar of the Indian government.Another MoneyControl report said that Garena is working to address the situation. Shopee has not responded to an email sent by Tech in Asia asking whether it is concerned about its expansion plans in the country.This is not the first time Sea’s business units have been questioned in India. In December last year, the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), a trade body in the country, also alleged that Shopee has Chinese roots, which violates the country’s foreign direct investment rules. It has sought a ban on the ecommerce platform and even highlighted that group CEO Li was born in China.Another bone of contention for the trade body is that Chinese conglomerate Tencent holds a stake in Sea. It is worth mentioning that Tencent is also a shareholder in several Indian startups including Flipkart, Byju’s, Swiggy, Udaan, and Ola.CAIT has in the past targeted “foreign companies” such as Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart for engaging in “unethical practice” in India. It even organized an ecommerce purification week in June last year, aimed at setting up a monitoring mechanism for ecommerce trade. But none of these complaints have really had much of an impact on the operations or businesses of these ecommerce companies.A screenshot of the Shopee India websiteEarlier in January, Tencent cut its stake in Sea Group from 21.3% to 18.7%, which some say is a step to water down further China-related issues in India.One of Shopee’s other complaints comes from a customer in the state of Uttar Pradesh, who had filed a first information reportwith the police against the company for selling counterfeit products. When Tech in Asia checked, it found several products labeled as Gucci and Prada were being sold for bargain-basement prices, which were later removed from the app. The Shopee app has also been named on the US Trade Representatives’ Notorious Markets for Counterfeiting and Piracy 2021 list.The issue of fakes isn’t unique to Shopee. Recently, a case was also lodged against Amazon India for selling fake ayurvedic products of a particular brand.Shopee is looking to hire a dedicated person to track fraudulent activities on the app. This could bolster its Shopee Guarantee feature, which withholds payment to sellers until consumers are satisfied with a purchase.CAIT has also knocked on the doors of the country’s regulatory watchdog, the Competition Commission of India, claiming that Shopee is allegedly involved in predatory pricing and negatively affecting the marketplace. The ecommerce company has already faced such scrutiny in Malaysia, the Philippines, and Indonesia.See also: Shopee’s rivals cry foul over its aggressive tactics to win sellersBut one cannot ignore the fact that Shopee also has operational experience from several countries. “So they can easily take care of these regulatory issues if they want to play long in India,” says Meena.Update (Feb. 21, 12:15 p.m. SGT): This article was updated to include that the Shopee app has been named on the USTR’s Notorious Markets for Counterfeiting and Piracy 2021 list.","Regulatory hurdles, counterfeit items, and “China-related” issues are not stopping Shopee from snapping up millions of followers in India.",589814,Samreen Ahmad,True,"Collin Furtado, Terence Lee, and Jaclyn Tiu",0,"['Analysis', 'Ecommerce', 'Premium Content']","['Amazon', 'Ecommerce', 'flipkart', 'India', 'Meesho', 'Sea Group', 'shopee', 'Shopee India', 'Snapdeal', 'Southeast Asia']",False,,True,True,True,False,8

732638,2022-02-16T04:00:44,2022-02-17T05:18:37,Singapore is opening the doors to Southeast Asian tech expansion,singapore-opening-doors-southeast-asian-tech-expansion,post,"Southeast Asia’s tech scene isn’t the wild west it used to be. Maturing markets, repeat founders, and a digital-savvy customer base are transforming the region into a global hub for innovation.Despite last year’s upheavals, Southeast Asian startups raised over US$8.2 billion in capital, and they are predicted to achieve a combined value of US$1 trillion by 2025.For Sukumar Suresh, regional vice president of Singapore’s Economic Development Board (EDB), the 649 million digitally-dominant Southeast Asians and the region’s nascent infrastructure are driving an “unprecedented boom” for startups in the ecommerce, financial services, healthcare, and education sectors.Opportunity knocks as SEA markets matureUnlike more mature markets like China and the US, processes and infrastructure in Southeast Asia are not as defined, leaving plenty of room for startups to experiment and innovate with new solutions tailored to each market.For example, travel startup Traveloka expanded its range of payment solutions to include cash and buy now, pay later options to support Southeast Asia’s significant unbanked population.Kelvin Teo, the co-founder and director of alternative investment platform Funding Societies, notes that though Southeast Asian customers are sophisticated internet users, the markets themselves aren’t as competitive as their more established Western counterparts. This, along with the large number of digitally dominant customer bases, presents significant opportunities for fast-growth tech startups.Kelvin Teo, the co-founder and director of Funding Societies / Photo credit: Funding Societies“As tech often entails change and at times disruption, a good tech hub has to serve as a testbed for innovation and provide a stable base for production and expansion,” he says.Differences divide the regionDespite the promise Southeast Asia holds for companies looking to expand, startups still have to grapple with pain points, many of which can be seen throughout the region’s various ecosystems.Willson Cuaca, co-founder and managing partner of investment firm East Ventures, says the shortage of tech talent is one of the major hurdles that startups face, especially for foreign firms looking to expand into Southeast Asia. It’s estimated that by 2030, Asia Pacific will be short of the 47 million tech talents needed to meet growing demand.“[The problem] is particularly acute for a rising tech ecosystem like Southeast Asia, where the local talent supply is far from sufficient,” Teo adds. “It takes more convincing to attract foreign talents to our shores, pushing salaries to exorbitant levels – but then the environment is not conducive for them to stay and naturalize in the long-term, resulting in a leaky bucket problem.”Each country is unique and startups need to build a platform that is common for all yet flexible to hyperlocal wisdom.Another issue for companies looking to expand in Southeast Asia is the fragmentation and diversity of the region’s markets.“Each of Southeast Asia’s 11 countries has a different regulatory, economic, and social environment,” says Teo. “Tech firms have to choose between concentration risk in a bigger country and the pains of entering multiple distinct markets – many choose somewhere in between.”For Cuaca, what’s important is that startups figure out early on who their target audiences are. “Each country is unique and startups need to build a platform that is common for all yet flexible to hyperlocal wisdom,” he explains.Singapore risingDespite the relatively small size of its market, Teo says Singapore acts as an ideal “warm up” for cross-regional expansion because of its international reputation and government initiatives to cultivate investment, talent, and connections.“While Singapore doesn’t share the same attitude toward entrepreneurship risk as Tel Aviv, the tech ecosystem in Singapore is unique thanks to strategic state intervention and its position between East and West,” he says, referencing the government’s concerted effort to foster tech innovation through infrastructure, funding, and community building.According to Suresh, the island nation is home to over 600 investors and 200 accelerators and incubators, not to mention various state and government-linked initiatives.For example, state-linked investment company Temasek has become an active champion of deep tech startups, having recently announced an annual US$738 million commitment to deep tech startups. The commitment follows on the government’s plan to spend US$18.4 billion over five years on technology-related research and development.Streamlining for business-friendlinessFunding aside, Singapore is also a conducive environment for startups looking for a gateway to the rest of Southeast Asia. The country has consistently ranked as one of the best in terms of ease of doing business because of access to talent and business-friendly regulations.Cuaca says that Singapore’s government has been especially progressive in helping startups find connections to not just funding, but also global partners and tech talent. In 2021, EDB’s investment arm helped 25 startups raise US$216 million in funding from private investors.Willson Cuaca, co-founder and managing partner of East Ventures / Photo credit: East VenturesFurthermore, major events like AsiaTechX Singapore and SFFxSWITCH, as well as government-led initiatives like the Global Innovation Alliance, Digital Economy Agreements, and Open Innovation Network, help connect local Singaporean startups to global tech communities.Suresh points out that ​​the country’s progressive approach to regulation has promoted strong partnerships between government and business.“Singapore takes a different approach by working closely together with tech companies to develop and test new technologies that may not be ready for the real world,” he says. Suresh brings up the example of how the local authorities collaborated with Grab and nuTonomy to test out the world’s first driverless taxi on public roads.The country’s wellspring of businesses has naturally made it attractive to talent from all over the world. Teo says that for startups, the availability of skilled workers makes Singapore an important place to be in, especially as he predicts talent competition will “evolve into a fully-fledged war.”“As big tech firms set up regional headquarters and scale up their tech hiring, the pinch in talent will be more acutely felt by smaller tech firms and might hurt the long-term vibrancy of the tech ecosystem,” he adds.However, Teo says the government’s efforts to cultivate tech talent through educational institutions like the National University of Singapore’s Overseas College and upskilling programs like SkillsFuture is one step in the right direction.Singapore has also teamed up with countries in the region to develop partnerships that provide companies with a steady pipeline of tech talent. Suresh brings up the example of Nongsa Digital Park (NDP), a Batam-based tech hub that trains and hires Indonesian tech talent to complement and support the operations of Singapore-based companies as part of a holistic and integrated regional tech strategy. NDP also serves as a “digital bridge” between Indonesia and Singapore enabling companies from both countries to collaborate and innovate to achieve mutually beneficial outcomes.The momentum keeps goingFrom Suresh’s perspective, Singapore could be a “tech innovation flywheel” that can serve both local startups looking to scale and commercialize their business as well as established firms that see the bigger potential of the greater Southeast Asia region.Sukumar Suresh, regional vice president of EDB / Photo credit: EDBCuaca says that though most countries in Southeast Asia are still playing catch-up due to the newness of the digital economy, it’s important that governments and the private sector keep talking and moving forward together in the same rhythm.“Fortunately, many governments are aware of the challenges, and have demonstrated exceptional willingness to engage the industry and work to provide expansion solutions,” Teo adds. “More has to be done in providing expansion solutions and governments have been a meaningful part of that, but the key is upkeep.”Singapore’s Economic Development Board (EDB), a government agency under the Ministry of Trade and Industry, is working to build up the country’s tech ecosystem to support companies looking to reap the rewards of Southeast Asia’s digital potential.To gain more insights on how you can go further in the region, subscribe to EDB’s newsletter.This content was produced by Tech in Asia Studios, which connects brands with Asia’s tech community.

733027,2022-02-16T03:42:53,2022-02-16T03:42:17,Exclusive: India’s Goqii bags $50m series C money for SEA launch,india-healthtech-firm-goqii-bags-50m-series-c-money-sea-launch,post,"Goqii, a tech-enabled healthcare platform based in India, told Tech in Asia that it has raised US$50 million in a series C round led by Sumeru Ventures, a global VC firm.Other participants in the round include Modality, 9Unicorns, Venture Catalysts, Mitsui, The Times Group, and Ascendo, as well as a clutch of angel investors.The fundraise also includes venture debt funding, which was led by Blacksoil Capital and Trifecta Capital.(From left) Goqii founder Vishal Gondal and Tata Group chairman emeritus Ratan Tata / Photo credit: Vishal GondalGoqii, which is also backed by Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma and Tata Group chairman emeritus Ratan Tata, last raised an undisclosed sum in November 2018 in a round led by Mitsui.The startup offers a wide range of health-focused services that include wearable fitness bands, personalized remote coaching, and diagnostics.Goqii was founded in 2014 by Vishal Gondal, who previously served as a managing director at The Walt Disney Company. His first startup, IndiaGames, was acquired in 2012 by DisneyUTV Digital, a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company India. He is also a well-known angel investor in the Indian startup space.SEA expansion on the cardsGondal told Tech in Asia that the company will soon enter the Southeast Asian market. It plans to start offering its services through local partnerships in Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia by the end of the year.Outside Southeast Asia, Goqii is eyeing Japan and the US.Gondal revealed that the company’s strategy will be to identify partners – which could be insurance, healthcare, or independent service providers – to roll out in the markets mentioned above. He added that the company will also tailor its solutions for these markets.Goqii is banking on its deep experience in the healthcare space as its target markets have demographics facing lifestyle-related health issues such as diabetes.It is worth noting that Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia all have sizable healthcare industries. The healthcare market in Singapore is expected to grow to US$49.4 billion by 2029. Meanwhile, the healthcare industries of Indonesia and Malaysia generated revenues worth US$41.2 billion and US$14 billion, respectively, in 2020.Team Goqii/Photo credit: GoqiiInsuring faster growthGondal described the Covid-19 pandemic as the demonetization moment, wherein the Indian government’s order to ban currency notes with denominations of 500 rupees and 1,000 rupees led to an exponential growth of digital payments in the country.The pandemic has also led to a huge demand for digital health services and solutions. Factors such as healthcare awareness, easier access to insurance, and rising incomes are seen to drive India’s healthcare market to hit US$372 billion by 2022, according to a KPMG report.The last couple of years have seen several landmark deals in the Indian healthtech space. PharmEasy, a six-year-old startup, paid US$613 million to acquire a 66.1% stake in Thyrocare Technologies, one of the country’s largest diagnostics laboratory chains. Tata Digital acquired online pharmacy 1mg in June last year. Temasek and Zomato-backed fitness firm Curefit recently raised US$145 million in a series F round.See also: A landmark deal: The $600m buyout by a Temasek-backed Indian e-pharmacy unicornThe heightened competition may point to why Goqii is doubling down on verticals like insurance with the new funding.The company has come up with an “outcome-based insurance” service, which leverages data from its solutions to help provide a relevant insurance plan. The company has already partnered with insurance service providers such as Max Bupa and Bajaj Allianz.It’s worth noting that India’s insurance market hit US$280 billion in 2020 and is projected to grow at a rate of up to 15% annually by 2023.Goqii’s larger picture is a 360-degree approach to healthcare, where it will provide a combination of multiple health-focused services such as disease management and remote coaching, among others.However, Gondal does not believe that Goqii is turning into a health-focused super app, explaining that the company is focused on the preventive healthcare space. Taking a critical view of the super-app concept, he said that some players are building such platforms because they do not have a particular use case and therefore offer everything under a single roof to keep users engaged daily.That is not the case with Goqii, he added.Photo credit: GoqiiGetting fit for an IPOGondal revealed that the company’s revenue had increased by 250% since the start of the pandemic. He added that the company also saw an upward trajectory in other metrics such as average selling price per user, which grew 40% in the same period.Goqii aims to have 2 million monthly active users by the end of 2022 and 5 million in the next three years. The platform currently has nearly 800,000 monthly active users.Gondal pointed out that the company’s user base consists solely of paid users as it does not have a free model. Goqii offers its services through a subscription model, with prices starting at 1,599 rupees (US$21).The company is also targeting US$100 million in revenue in the next 18 to 24 months. Goqii says that over the last few years, it has been seeing a compound annual growth rate of 100%, and it is expecting similar fast-paced growth for the next few years.The healthtech firm also has plans to go public – while the timeline is not finalized, Gondal expects an IPO to happen in the next 18 months. He said the company is keeping all options open, whether it is to list in India or overseas via a special purpose acquisition company vehicle. Goqii is also considering inorganic growth via mergers and acquisitions.“We’re working on a strategy, but we are not looking to roll up random companies,” Gondal added.With its good financial health and ambitious expansion plans, Goqii appears confident about the road ahead. While its entry to Southeast Asia may give it a big boost, a lot will ride on how the firm implements its local partnerships and meets its ambitious targets.Currency converted from Indian rupee to US dollar: US$1 = 75.19 rupees.","The company will soon expand its services to Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia.",580372,Kul Bhushan,True,Collin Furtado and Lorenzo Kyle Subido,0,"['Gadgets', 'Investments', 'News', 'Premium Content']","['fitness wearables', 'Funding', 'GOQii', 'health insurance', 'India', 'investments', 'Vishal Gondal']",False,,True,True,True,False,5

732882,2022-02-16T01:55:28,2022-02-15T15:22:41,"Ajaib, Stockbit drive Indonesia’s stock-trading boom",ajaib-stockbit-drive-indonesia-stock-trading,post,"Amid the pandemic, stock trading has become a favorite pastime in many countries, and Indonesia is no exception. By June 2020, the country had 1.2 million retail investors – a 12% rise from six months earlier.That inflow of new investors has lifted the country’s stock-trading apps to new heights. Stockbit, for instance, was valued at US$10.8 million in Q4 2019, according to data from VentureCap Insights. By Q2 2021, it was valued at US$347 million, following a series D round.Ajaib, one of Stockbit’s competitors, has gone a step further, becoming one of Indonesia’s latest unicorns.Perhaps more impressively, Ajaib has done so in only two and a half years. Among Indonesia’s unicorns, only Ovo has reached the milestone quicker.“To date, the app has more than 1 million investors, dominated by the younger generation, especially millennials and Gen Z,” a source close to Ajaib tells Tech in Asia.The size of Stockbit’s user base is also similar, a spokesperson confirms. That said, Stockbit has an additional 2 million users through Bibit, the mutual funds robo adviser it acquired in 2019.If the trajectory of US-based stock-trading app Robinhood – which went public in 2021 at a valuation of US$32 billion – is anything to go by, there may be good reason for bullishness around its Indoneasian counterparts.“It’s not impossible that Ajaib will become as big as Robinhood within a short time,” Chandra Tjan, partner at Alpha JWC Ventures, previously told Tech in Asia.Ajaib founders Anderson Sumarli (left) and Yada Piyajomkwan / Photo credit: AjaibBut Ajaib and Stockbit are hardly the only players in this space. Indonesia’s major banks and asset managers also offer apps besides their in-house services. Meanwhile, there are newer players like Pluang, which offers multiple products (including cryptocurrency) via a single app.“Competition in this vertical is still at an early stage,” notes Melisa Irene, partner at Stockbit backer East Ventures. “Opportunities are still wide open for potential new players.”Battling the establishmentPerhaps what’s most impressive is how quickly these apps have grown.Stockbit, for instance, saw its valuation climb over 30x in just a year and a half to US$10.8 million in Q4 2019. Ajaib, meanwhile, has raised a total of US$245 million in disclosed funding – 90% of that was raised entirely in 2021, spread across three different rounds.“We conducted experiments in 2019, finding product-market fit in 2020, and hyperscaled in 2021,” Anderson Sumarli, Ajaib’s co-founder and CEO, wrote on LinkedIn.While the pandemic has played a pivotal role behind the rise of these apps, East Ventures’ Irene believes this is a long-term trend.She says there are many factors behind the trend, including increased financial literacy among the general public and online platforms themselves. Also, Indonesia’s millennials and Gen Z – the main target markets of both Ajaib and Stockbit – now make up the majority of Indonesia’s population.Zuhdi Ahmad, a retail investor and Ajaib user, hails the app’s “easy” user experience, precisely because it is geared toward millennials.From a marketing standpoint, Ajaib’s education among younger users is “very relevant” to how they view stock trading, he explains. “Initially, the stock market was such a foreign world,” he points out.Photo credit: AjaibBut these new platforms face stiff competition from established players like Indonesia’s big banks and asset management firms. Bank Mandiri and Bank Central Asia – two of Indonesia’s biggest banks by assets – have launched apps to supplement their long-running investment businesses, as have more specialized firms like South Korea’s Mirae Asset.One such player is asset manager Indo Premier Sekuritas (IPOT). Its customers previously transacted via desktops, but the company launched an app in 2020 to tap into the wave of new users.Unlike its “establishment” peers, IPOT’s app has managed to gain over 1 million active users to become a rival to up-and-coming startups.However, third-party estimates show that, apart from IPOT, these apps have relatively smaller user bases compared with Ajaib’s or Stockbit’s.But that may be because they are older users with long-standing relationships with banks and their brokers – as well as with larger investment sums.“These services are what my bosses used,” Ahmad says. “Especially once you have several billion rupiah in management, you typically do business through your broker.”Ahmad himself uses both Ajaib and BCA Sekuritas, the investment arm of Indonesia’s largest private bank. He uses Ajaib for short-term investments – a mixture of blue-chip and penny stocks – and for learning technical analysis.His investments through BCA, on the other hand, are “low risk, low return” blue-chip stocks that he plans to hold for 10 years or more.Expanding into crypto?Still, simplicity is important when targeting first-time retail investors, and Ajaib and Stockbit have had to forgo certain features offered by the banks. Ahmad, for instance, uses specialized stock analysis apps such as RTI Business to plan his investments, as they provide more data than Ajaib.Dewi Rachmat, a former business journalist and a retail investor, agrees that Ajaib’s analysis is not as detailed as that ofMandiri Online Securities Trading (MOST). But that may not be a big issue.“While apps like MOST are better in providing more detailed analyses, this new crop of retail investors may not really need it,” she explains. “They can find analyses in other sources, such as online content” on platforms like Telegram.There’s also value in acquiring younger users now, as they will have rising incomes and make larger investments as they get older.“The success of an investment startup will depend on its ability to build a user community so that it creates a sticky or loyalty effect,” adds East Ventures’ Irene.Of course, it’s still early days, and the bigger threat for Ajaib or Stockbit may come from other startups.Investment in cryptocurrencies is enjoying its moment in the sun as apps like TokoCrypto or Indodax draw similar – or even higher – active user counts as stock-trading apps, according to third-party estimates.New players like Pluang, which bills itself as an “all-in-one” investment app, have enjoyed decent momentum of late. While Pluang currently does not let users trade on the Indonesia Stock Exchange, it lets them invest in assets like gold, US stocks, and cryptocurrency.It’s not clear whether Ajaib or Stockbit plan to incorporate cryptocurrency into their offerings. However, it is a path that Robinhood has recently taken – the US company claims its global expansion will be “crypto-first”.For Ajaib at least, taking that step wouldn’t be that much of a stretch, especially since it shares an investor – Ribbit Capital – with Robinhood and Coinbase.But for now, Ajaib has set its sights on another popular sector: digital banks. The company has invested US$52 million in Bank Bumi Arta, and likely plans to convert it into a digibank.Ultimately, it’s worth noting that Indonesia’s 2.7 million stock investors make up only about 1% of the country’s population.“Even though it has grown, the proportion of Indonesian retail investors compared to its productive population is still far below neighbors like Singapore and Malaysia,” says a Stockbit spokesperson. “The potential is huge.”",Ajaib became a unicorn in just two and a half years.

Toward the end of 2021, four experienced tech veterans from Google, Microsoft, Airbnb, and Grab were cooking up their own GameFi platform.Singapore-based Ethlas announced today that it has secured US$2.7 million in seed funding from Sequoia Capital India, Yield Guild Games Southeast Asia, Global Blockchain Innovative Capital, and a host of other backers.The Ethlas team / Photo credit: EthlasDemystifying blockchain gamingLaunched in November last year, Ethlas operates a free-to-play and play-to-earn (P2E) blockchain-based game metaverse built on the Polygon chain. According to the company’s website, the games it offers play similar to already popular mobile games like 2048, Candy Crush, andTetris.Ethlas’ founders came up with the idea to launch the startup when they found that Filipinos have been earning more from playing P2E games compared to their day jobs.“Ethlas is a game aggregator – on one hand onboarding early players onto blockchain, but also appealing to the game studios to list their games on the site,” Elston Sam, co-founder of Ethlas, toldTech in Asia.The company said it’s currently working with game studios to launch their titles on Ethlas under a revenue-sharing model.Ethlas co-founder Elston Sam / Photo credit: EthlasSam established Ethlas alongside three other co-founders, including US-based Gennady Medvinsky. Before Ethlas, Medvinsky built products and platforms for companies such as Microsoft, Grab, and Google. The two other co-founders are currently in stealth mode.They currently lead a team of 22 blockchain engineers, game developers, data scientists, cybersecurity experts, and designers who are based in Singapore, the US, and the Philippines. Ethlas plans to “aggressively” hire more as it builds out its platform in the coming months.To start playing on Ethlas, users only need to install or link their existing crypto wallets. These games can also be played on a PC or a mobile phone’s browser.This is in contrast to most GameFi platforms that require subscription fees or upfront capital. For Axie Infinity, a good team could cost upwards of US$1,000.“One key product metric we anchor on is that it takes two minutes for a user landing for the first time on our website to the point they are playing their first game and having fun – no download hassle, crazy registration flow, paywall, or complex game mechanics,” Sam shared.See also: Explaining Axie Infinity and its mercurial riseEthlas to the moonWithin 14 weeks of its launch, the company said it saw over 120,000 unique crypto wallets onboard its platform. This already puts it ahead of 90% of the existing GameFi titles, according to Sam.The number, however, is light-years away from Ethlas’ moonshot vision of one billion players.Sam said that the number of blockchain gamers right now is in the single-digit millions, while casual gamers top out at around 2.5 billion. “By combining strong and growing consumer demand for crypto or blockchain, and the expanding reach of casual games, Ethlas is aptly positioned to be at the intersection of the mass adoption of Web3,” he added.See also: Explaining Vietnam’s crypto boomEthlas said it also plans to work with regulators on a framework for GameFi, as the company believes that regulations and consumer education are two key factors for blockchain gaming’s entry into the mainstream.Bringing its vision a bit closer to Earth’s atmosphere, Sam said that the company aims to have 10 million active users by the end of the year. The co-founder also believes that the launch of its first series of NFTs, called Komos, will help drive both user and revenue growth.Ethlas’ Komo NFT / Image credit: EthlasModeled after the Komodo Dragons of Indonesia, Komos will allow gamers on Ethlas’ platform to boost their gameplay and gain more XGEMs (Exchange Genesis Ethlas Medium), the in-game cryptocurrency of its metaverse. Like other NFTs, Komos are unique in that they have different sets of traits like fangs, horns, eyes, and skin color.“The unique value proposition of Komo NFTs is that they do not only function as game passes on Ethlas, granting players special access to games and features. They are also asset-backed NFTs,” explained Sam, adding that the NFT will have both artistic and monetary value.However, one challenge Sam sees is how Ethlas can balance catering its offerings to free-to-play players new to the GameFi scene and crypto natives focused on the big financial returns they’re accustomed to.“Our job is to balance the needs of these two constituents with that of game studios and create a thriving marketplace,” Sam said. “The good news is that the founding team have all been marketplace builders in their past lives, so they know how to crack this puzzle to attract the next billion users into the Ethlas Metaverse.”","Ethlas, which is releasing its first set of NFTs, raised the seed funding from Sequoia, Yield Guild Games SEA, and a host of other backers.",270460,Miguel Cordon,True,Collin Furtado and Lorenzo Kyle Subido,0,"['Blockchain', 'Gaming', 'Investments', 'News', 'Premium Content']","['blockchain', 'blockchain games', 'crypto', 'cryptocurrency', 'ethlas', 'play to earn', 'Sequoia Capital India', 'yield guild games southeast asia']",False,,True,True,True,False,4

The fintech firm is Vietnam’s latest unicorn after its US$200 million series E round led by Japan’s Mizuho Bank, which was announced in December 2021. The fancy office signifies MoMo’s dramatic growth from a SIM card-based digital wallet to a payment app reaching 31 million users.MoMo’s new headquarters in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam / Photo credit: MoMoMoMo has cornered more than half of the market share in Vietnam’s digital wallet space. The company is targeting to become a fintech super app, mirroring the strategies of WeChat and Alipay. To that end, MoMo has added financial services such as credit scoring, savings, and buy now, pay later (BNPL) onto its platform.The pandemic has accelerated adoption of digital payment services in the country, with the State Bank of Vietnam estimating that mobile wallet transaction value reached nearly US$15 billion in 2020. However, the majority of users still haven’t used fintech platforms for their other financial needs.As such, digital payment companies like MoMo must diversify their offerings and tap into underserved segments.These companies should expect intense competition from niche players like Timo (digital banking), Infina and Anfin (investment apps), F88 (digital lending), and a host of BNPL and insurtech startups.In addition, commercial banks and telecom operators have swiftly moved to offer digital financial products. In fact, most of their payment apps rank highly in both downloads and active users.Unlike fintech companies that constantly have to raise funds, commercial banks have far deeper resources. In 2021, two of Vietnam’s major commercial banks, Vietcombank and Techcombank, both achieved the billion-dollar profit milestone. Banks have also started offering zero-fee policies for selected features to lure back customers from fintech platforms.Still, a large chunk of the population remains outside the traditional banking system, leaving room for further disruption, especially in categories such as digital lending for individuals and small businesses.Even without a clear legal framework guiding the sector, investors remain bullish on the country’s fintech potential. They have invested more than US$580 million in 2021 alone. For this report, we have excluded crypto and blockchain players as the explosive growth of the sector requires a separate analysis.Here’s a look at how funding in the space has been going lately:Here are the details on the funding rounds that we’ve tracked:We hope that as we constantly update our database, this will be a useful reference for anyone who’s interested in Vietnam’s fintech space.You can also catch our coverage of Vietnam’s tech sector here and check out more landscape reports here.

Informative and witty, it gives you everything you need to know to start your day. Choose the Daily Newsletter option to get it  delivered to your inbox or read it right here on our site.Hello reader,Remember when teenagers ruled social media and adults always bemoaned how it was a waste of time? Last week, my grandfather excitedly showed me a meme of a bear trying to high five a man in a car, while its bear friends looked on.It took me years to convince my grandfather to join social media, but it’s worked out for the better (I guess). But as older generations finally come to grips with a decade-old pastime, the kids have moved on to something more mysterious: the blockchain.Tech VCs in Southeast Asia face the same generational hurdle in embracing the latest craze among millennials and Gen Z.Despite the saviness of these investors, finding a way to put their money behind this disruptive phenomenon is a big ask. Traditional VC firms are playing it safe for now because backing crypto firms demands a different skill set and expectations. Add some regulatory uncertainty to that mix, and it’s clear to see why VC firms aren’t quite ready to dive into the deep end yet.Meanwhile, crypto firms are keener on bringing in investors who have extensive connections within the crypto ecosystem, which might not be the strongest suit of typical VCs.My colleague Ardi recently unpacked why blockchain players are struggling to win investor confidence. And while traditional VC firms are still wrapping their heads around the blockchain, crypto-native investors already have a game plan.Today we look at:The limited participation of SEA’s tech VCs in the crypto raceHow a VC firm backed by Bukalapak’s founders has bet on an Indonesian fintech startup that could be the next game changer  Other newsy highlights such as Binance’s media gambit and a Singapore-based VC’s first fund.Premium summaryCrypto VCs built differentImage credit: Timmy LoenThough they are few in number, crypto VCs are playing the investment game on a different level. Like college grads, these firms host “party rounds,” where a bunch of investors take part but often don’t have a lead backer. These rounds are much smaller than what typical tech VCs in Southeast Asia are used to, and they don’t come with the same kinds of exits either.All these factors have made traditional VCs cautious about going all-in with crypto-based projects. Tech VCs have their work cut out for them to gain the trust of crypto founders, but that effort may be necessary to ensure that the industry will grow “beyond the crypto bubble.”Old school meets new game: Southeast Asia’s crypto startups collectively raised funding from over 150 investors last year, according to Tech in Asia data. Of these backers, only 11 are conventional tech VCs based in the region. These include Singapore’s Vertex Ventures and B Capital, Indonesia’s BRI Ventures and Intudo, and Thailand’s SCB 10X.Spoiled for choice: The region’s crypto players have the luxury of picking their investors since their deals are always oversubscribed, said Irene Umar, co-founder of blockchain-focused Yield Guild Games Southeast Asia. These firms are only looking for backers with crypto know-how and contacts in the ecosystem, which sometimes leaves typical tech VCs high and dry.Gatekeepers of deal flow: Full-fledged crypto VCs have it good right now as they have an edge over their more traditional counterparts when it comes to deal flow and high-quality projects.

However, the two companies differ in their approach: Brex encourages businesses to spend more by incentivizing employees, while Monit’s software is designed to help companies boost profits and reduce expenses.Bigger and better: As proven local unicorn builders, Zaky and Xinuc are looking to double Init 6’s existing portfolio. They’re also considering elevating the fund to a conventional limited partner-general partner (LP-GP) structure.Quick bytes1️⃣  Binance takes a chance on mediaThe world’s biggest crypto exchange by trading volume has poured US$200 million in strategic backing into Forbes, the 104-year-old media titan.

Last week, my grandfather excitedly showed me a meme of a bear trying to high five a man in a car, while its bear friends looked on.It took me years to convince my grandfather to join social media, but it’s worked out for the better (I guess). But as older generations finally come to grips with a decade-old pastime, the kids have moved on to something more mysterious: the blockchain.Tech VCs in Southeast Asia face the same generational hurdle in embracing the latest craze among millennials and Gen Z.Despite the saviness of these investors, finding a way to put their money behind this disruptive phenomenon is a big ask. Traditional VC firms are playing it safe for now because backing crypto firms demands a different skill set and expectations. Add some regulatory uncertainty to that mix, and it’s clear to see why VC firms aren’t quite ready to dive into the deep end yet.Meanwhile, crypto firms are keener on bringing in investors who have extensive connections within the crypto ecosystem, which might not be the strongest suit of typical VCs.My colleague Ardi recently unpacked why blockchain players are struggling to win investor confidence.

Delivered every Monday via email and through the Tech in Asia website, this free newsletter breaks down the biggest stories and latest trends on Asia’s publicly listed tech companies. If you’re not a subscriber, get access by registering here.Hello reader,This being the first edition of the Opening Bell, it’s only appropriate that we touch on the retail trading frenzy that has gripped stock markets around the world. Easy access to online brokerages – coupled with a bit of FOMO – amid the Covid-19 pandemic drove countless tech-savvy millennials to park idle money in stocks.However, a closer look reveals a hidden underlying trend. It seems that online broking startups in Asia have stolen a march on their more experienced banking counterparts.For instance, Zerodha, a fintech darling of Indian millennials, shook up the decades-old broking industry with its zero-brokerage-fee model and is now comfortably the country’s largest broker, having more than double the active clients than its closest listed counterpart, ICICI Securities Ltd (ISEC, NSE), which runs the trading platform ICICIDirect.Meanwhile, online stock brokerage Ajaib in 2021 became Indonesia’s fastest unicorn and is leaving more established players, such as Bank Mandiri’s Mandiri Sekuritas (BMRI, IDX), biting the dust, having captured over a million of the archipelago’s roughly 2.7 million equity investors.However, given the close links between online stock broking and digibank services, Ajaib may soon face heated competition from players such as Bukalapak (BUKA, IDX), which is set to enter Indonesia’s digibank race.The Indonesian ecommerce giant’s co-founders have even doubled down on the fintech sector, with their VC firm, Init 6, joining the seed round of Monit, a B2B fintech startup, Tech in Asia exclusively reported.Speaking of ecommerce giants, we released the first episode of our video series on how Shopee made use of Sea Group’s (SE, NYSE) war chest and Tencent’s backing to dethrone Lazada and become Southeast Asia’s top ecommerce platform within five years.Meanwhile, IPO-bound J&amp;T Express, another Tencent-backed company, is making waves. With a pre-money valuation of about US$20 billion, the logistics firm has scaled new heights by riding the boom in Indonesia’s ecommerce space. Our premium story looks at the keys to its global ambitions.And, now back to the pandemic-induced retail trading boom, which has led to wild market swings and even brought on the “meme stock” phenomenon (members of ​​r/BursaBets and r/WallStreetBets, we’re looking at you 👀). However, this is not always a good thing, as the cautionary tale of stockbroking app Robinhood (HOOD, NDAQ) has shown us.The online stockbroking pioneer has seen its share price collapse by around 84% from its 52-week high of US$85 after heightened regulatory scrutiny. Additionally, the US trading frenzy has shown signs of waning amid climbing interest rates and inflation.It has not all been smooth sailing for online stockbrokers in Asia either. Stocks of Tencent-backed Futu Holdings (FUTU, NDAQ) and UP Fintech (TIGR, NDAQ), which runs Tiger Brokers, have endured a torrid year despite churning out promising numbers.They have come under the microscope as China’s central bank has warned that online brokerages not licensed by Beijing were operating illegally if they were serving Chinese clients through the internet.— Shravanth4 Stocks to watchHot stocks, earnings reports, restructuring, activist investor pressure, and more. We also feature the stocks that are likely to make big moves this week.Image credit: Timmy Loen🇨🇳Alibaba (BABA, NYSE): The pioneer of Singles’ Day is reporting its third-quarter results during Valentine’s week, with its earnings expected on Tuesday, February 15. It’s been a tumultuous couple of years for the Chinese ecommerce behemoth amid the Xi administration’s fierce crackdown on the country’s tech companies. The stock is currently trading more than 50% below its 52-week high of US$274.29.🇮🇳Zomato (ZOMATO, NSE): Having plunged nearly 6% on Friday, this stock is likely to be on the radar of the “buy-the-dip” kind of investor. The foodtech giant reported a loss of ​​998 million rupees (US$13.3 million) in the third quarter. The platform’s losses shrank 74% year over year, thanks largely to a one-time gain from the US$50 million sale of sports facilities provider Fitso to Curefit.🇩🇪Delivery Hero SE (DHER, ETR): The parent company of Foodpanda, the Asian food delivery giant, lost more than a third of its market value ‌after its FYE 2022 earnings outlook fell short of market expectations last week. Foodpanda’s results for the fourth quarter, however, were a bit more upbeat as the firm reported US$997.8 million in quarterly revenue – an almost 62% jump from the previous year.🇮🇳FSN E-Commerce Ventures (NYKAA, NSE): The Nykaa parent shed more than 10% last week after its third-quarter net profit slumped 58%. While it is one of the few profitable startups in India, the online fashion and beauty retailer’s quarterly expenses ballooned 91%.3 Market WhispersActually, a lot more reliable than a whisper, we highlight engaging source-based reporting from reputable news outlets around the globe.Photo credit: Tech in Asia Indonesia1️⃣ A cut where it hurts: Oyo is planning to reduce the size of its IPO offering as tech firms’ stock prices trend downward. The hotel chain’s public issue will be smaller than the US$1.2 billion originally planned. The hospitality startup, currently valued at US$9.6 billion, may slash both its primary and secondary share sale offers. Oyo may also have to readjust its valuation expectations.2️⃣ Hitting reset: Nike (NKE, NYSE) and Amazon (AMZN, NDAQ) have set their sights on Peloton Interactive (PTON, NDAQ), a maker of exercise bikes. Peloton, a one-time pandemic winner, replaced its CEO and cut 2,800 jobs in a bid to revitalize its sales and win back investor confidence. Its shares have surged around 50% over the last week.3️⃣ Pre-IPO prep: IPO-bound Carousell is in talks to buy Singapore-based proptech firm 99 Group for US$150 million in a cash-and-stock deal, two people familiar with the matter told Tech in Asia. The online classifieds giant has been in talks for a merger with blank-check company L Catterton Asia Acquisition to list in the US in a deal that could value the joint entity at US$1.5 billion.2 Quotes from the wiseWitty excerpts that leave you either scratching your head or grinning at your screen. Tech in Asia honors the changemakers of our time and of days gone by.Image credit: Automobile.“The foundation of the economy is labor,” Tesla CEO Elon Musk said during a recent earnings call. “So what happens if you don’t actually have a labor shortage? I’m not sure what an economy even means at that point. That’s what Optimus is about.” Say what you want about Musk, he knows how to build hype! Optimus is the humanoid robot Tesla first teased in 2021.“Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful” is the mantra of Warren Buffett, the famed investor and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway. With global markets whiplashing and reeling from inflationary pressure and rising geopolitical tensions, it’s probably time to pay heed to this quote.1 News you should knowWe put the spotlight on the story that’s got everyone talking and social media buzzing in the past week.Earnings, a mammoth deal collapse, and an IPO: SoftBank Group Corp (9984, TYO) has had quite a week. Its third-quarter net profit plunged 97% from the previous year, as tech valuations across the globe remained subdued.The Japan-based tech conglomerate also pulled the plug on its sale of semiconductor firm Arm to US chipmaker Nvidia Corp (NVDA, Nasdaq) for up to US$80 billion, having not received regulatory approvals.SoftBank is now working on an IPO for Arm, with the UK-based company likely to be listed on the tech-focused Nasdaq exchange by March 31, 2023.That’s it for this edition – we hope you liked it!Not your cup of tea?

Delivered once a month via email and through the Tech in Asia website, this free newsletter breaks down the biggest stories and trends in greentech. If you’re not a subscriber, get access by registering here.Hi there,Clean energy is a red-hot segment where advances are happening quickly. For example, renewables have become sought-after commodities as their prices plummeted over the past few years. But this growth has also given rise to a problem: insufficient storage capacity.In this issue, we’ll explore how storage troubles are holding back the renewable energy transition and look at the push for innovation in this space.Enjoy reading!THE BIG STORYMeet the players fighting plastic scourge in SEAPlastic waste startups are on the rise, but more needs to be done to scale their impact.DEEP READS1️⃣ Power storage is world’s next big net zero challengeThere’s an urgent problem in energy transition that has been largely overlooked: storage.Renewables such as solar and wind power fluctuate because the sun doesn’t always shine, and the wind doesn’t always blow. As renewable penetration increases, the cost of its intermittency will also shoot up. To ensure a constant supply of energy, back-ups are necessary during downtimes. But how do you go about this?Energy storage systems are a low-carbon way to do it. Building up long-duration storage capacity (8 hours or more) is crucial step towards energy transition. At present, global capacity to store renewables is inadequate, considering the demand. The US, for example, is capable of storing 595 gigawatt hours, which is roughly just an hour of its demand.Power providers are starting to focus on developing new technologies. Tech giants are also getting in the act: Google and Microsoft, for instance, are among the corporations that recently joined Long Duration Energy Storage Council, an organization that was formed at the United Nations Climate Change Conference 2021 (COP26). Moreover, capacity markets that provide financial support to companies supplying storage capacity are shaping up.Energy storage is currently concentrated in a handful of developed markets, including the US, UK, France, Australia, and Japan. China and India are also pouring investment into the space. And yet, solar and wind power are not abundant in most of these countries.Wind turbines / Photo credit: UnsplashThe UK, for example, is grappling with this problem as it works to phase out fossil fuels by 2050. One of the hurdles is the lack of sites where pumped hydro storage plants can be built. Pumped hydro is how most electricity is stored, accounting for around 98% of global capacity.Japan is also trying to advance the energy storage front. The government is planning to begin requiring power utilities to open up their grids to energy storage systems operated by other companies, hoping to grow its storage capacity. The government will also subsidize up to half the cost of battery storage systems to bolster its competitiveness against other types of energy storage.Another way to store energy is lithium-ion batteries. Its usage has become prevalent as the cost per kilowatt hour of storage drops, thanks to electric-car makers. But because these batteries are designed to store relatively small amounts of energy, few believe that they will play a big role in stabilizing renewables supply during long-haul winters, for instance. There’s also no significant reduction in costs with the expansion of storage capacity.Still, innovation happening in the space. Power providers in California are working on a long-duration storage system based on lithium-ion batteries.2️⃣ Cryptocurrency traders move into carbon marketsCryptocurrency’s outsized energy consumption has been under a lot of scrutiny, including from the likes of Tesla’s Elon Musk and, more recently, Mozilla founder Jamie Zalinski. A new study by Bank of America shows that in terms of annual emissions, Bitcoin has outpaced fossil fuel-reliant companies such as American Airlines.It’s no surprise then that cryptocurrency companies are eager to clear their names.Toucan, a Switzerland-based nonprofit specializing in decentralized finance, launched a carbon offset project in October that lets users trade carbon credits on cryptocurrency exchanges. Its carbon credits are linked to tokens called Base Carbon Tonne (BCT). According to Toucan, the goal is to create a more transparent platform by using real-time pricing data and record of trades to track who gets to take credit for funding green projects available to the public.But critics are skeptical, pointing out that the Toucan team chooses to maintain its anonymity – a move that’s at odds with its transparency claim. But believers including billionaire Mark Cuban think that the idea of cleaner cryptocurrency is promising.There are a myriad of new projects that aim to do something similar, from offering NFTs directly linked to purchasing carbon offsets to setting up mining farms that run on renewable energy.The booming crypto space is clashing with the carbon reduction pledges made by many countries. Lawmakers in the US and other places that host cryptomining farms are now closely examining the carbon footprint of this practice. Regulators in the European Union are also seeking to outlaw cryptomining activities.TRENDING NEWSYou can also check out Tech in Asia’s coverage of Asia’s greentech scene here.1️⃣ China showcases low-carbon tech for ‘green’ GamesThe Beijing Winter Olympics Committee says that its carbon-reduction efforts, such as retrofitting buildings from the 2008 Summer Games and using renewable energy, have saved about 158,300 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions. From the prep work to the post-event period, the Games’ footprint is estimated to be equivalent to 1.028 million tonnes of carbon dioxide.Why it matters:Despite these measures, Beijing still faces scrutiny over water usage because the need to make artificial snow puts more strain on water-scarce regions. Pandemic restrictions also have helped Beijing reduce emissions.The 2022 Winter Olympics opened on February 4. / Photo credit: Wikimedia Commons2️⃣ Amazon leads corporate clean-energy purchases in record yearThe ecommerce behemoth led a landmark year for renewable-energy purchases among corporations worldwide, according to a new report. In 2021, big businesses snapped up 31.1 gigawatts of clean energy capacity, with Amazon taking 20% of that total.Why it matters:More companies are shifting to clean energy as solar and wind power prices fall, making fossil fuels a less cost-effective option.3️⃣ China says U.S. tariff extension on solar products hurts new energy tradeContinuing to impose tariffs on solar products “won’t contribute to the healthy development of America’s solar industry and distorts the international trade order of solar as a new energy product,” according to China’s Ministry of Commerce.First introduced by the Trump administration in 2018, the the tariffs were recently extended by US President Joe Biden for another four years. However, the new terms excluded two-sided panels that are commonly deployed in bigger projects.Why it matters:Figuring out how to treat imported solar panels and cells remains a divisive issue in the US. Tariffs on products from China, the world’s largest supplier, can hold back the deployment of renewable energy in the US. Without the restriction, however, local solar players would be unable to compete with their Chinese counterparts.Photo credit: Unsplash4️⃣ Huawei bolts into Japan with renewable power storage, chasing TeslaThe Chinese telco is expected to start selling large-scale battery systems for clean energy storage in Japan by March. Huawei will purchase small battery packs from CATL, a leading lithium-ion battery supplier, and bundle them into shipping container-sized units with the storage capacity of approximately 200x as much as a standard household battery.Why it matters:Japan is trying to move away from fossil fuels, and having adequate capacity in its power grid is crucial for the massive deployment of renewable energy. The country’s large-scale battery industry is an increasingly competitive space occupied by players like Tesla.STARTUP WATCH1️⃣ Kyoto Fusioneering nets $11.6m in series B moneyThe Japanese firm, which develops fusion energy materials, components, and systems, has raised over US$11.6 million in an oversubscribed series B round from investors including Coral Capital, JIC Venture Growth Investments, and Jafco Group. The startup also secured a US$6.1 million loan from the Bank of Kyoto, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, and the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.2️⃣ VinFast plans to produce only EVs by late 2022The Vietnam-based automaker aims to cease manufacturing internal combustion engine vehicles and fully transition into producing electric vehicles starting later this year. VinFast is part of Vingroup, the country’s largest conglomerate.Photo credit: VinFast3️⃣ Shell-founded startup fund receives $13m from Canadian DFI to accelerate clean energy access in AfricaEnergy Entrepreneurs Growth Fund, which was initiated by the Shell Foundation and Dutch Entrepreneurial Development Bank, has received US$13 million from development finance institution FinDev Canada. The money will go towards boosting access to renewable energy for off-grid households and businesses in sub-Saharan Africa.4️⃣ Sylvera raises $32m in series A round to become source of truth in carbon marketsThe carbon offset rating company has secured US$32.6 million in a series A fundraise co-led by Index Ventures and Insight Partners. London-based Sylvera uses data and machine learning technology to generate information about the carbon offset market. It serves clients including Salesforce, Delta Airlines, Shell, and Cargill.5️⃣ Bill Gates invests in Verdox’s carbon capture technologyThe Massachusetts-based carbon capture startup got US$80 million from investors including Bill Gates’s Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Prelude Ventures, and Lowercarbon Capital. The funds will be use to develop and deploy Verdox’s electrochemical carbon-capture technology, which the company claims is less energy intensive.That’s it for this edition – we hope you liked it!

732582,2022-02-14T05:02:20,2022-02-15T04:56:04,Inside the tsunami of NFTs in India,tsunami-nfts-india,post,"Vimal Chandran’s mother often worries about her 30-something son’s obsession with pictures of “monkeys on the internet.”The monkey pictures she’s worried about aren’t just regular images, of course. They’re NFTs (non-fungible tokens) of apathetic primates. But the Bored Ape Yacht Club isn’t exactly a household name yet in the South Indian city of Palakkad, where Chandran, a visual artist, currently lives.Until last year, Chandran himself hadn’t seriously looked into NFTs. This changed after Mike Winkelmann, or Beeple as he’s better known, sold his NFT for US$69 million at a Christie’s auction in March 2021. Soon, Chandran found himself minting and buying NFTs.In December last year, Chandran’s NFT, titled WAGMI (an acronym for we’re all gonna make it), became the most expensive NFT sold on the NFT platform of Binance-owned crypto exchange WazirX.WAGMI by Vimal Chandran / Photo courtesy: WazirXWhile WAGMI was sold for 8,088 WRX (WazirX’s native token) or about US$7,700, WazirX’s total NFT sales have crossed 308,000 WRX since the launch of its NFT platform last June.The crypto exchange is just one of the many companies that are riding on what can only be described as a tsunami of NFT offerings in India. BeyondLife Club, Ikonz, BollyCoin, and Social Swag are some of the startups that have thrown their hat into the ring.The rise of NFTs and cryptocurrencies in India has seen its fair share of ups and downs as it has in other nations like Singapore and Indonesia.India’s banking regulator effectively hampered the growth of crypto-related startups in 2018 by barring banks from dealing with crypto exchanges. This ban was lifted only in 2020, with the intervention of the Supreme Court. But crypto-related businesses are still not in the clear, as there isn’t really a legal framework surrounding these companies.However, on February 1, the country’s finance minister announced a 30% tax on gains from crypto-related assets. While enthusiasts bemoaned the steep taxes, the announcement put talks of a possible crypto-related ban to rest.The timing couldn’t have been better. Globally, NFT sales volumes amounted to US$24.9 billion in 2021 compared to US$94.9 million the year before, according to data from DappRadar.Industry players might be reluctant to put a definite valuation on this evolving space.“Imagine a world where everything you see, from the buildings, roads, and artworks, are all made up of NFTs; it’s hard to put a tag on that. It’s changed so much already so quickly,” says Sandesh Suvarna, co-founder of WazirX’s NFT marketplace.A celebrity-backed gold rushA number of India’s NFT startups were launched in 2021 and quickly drew in investors. For example, Faze Technologies, a cricket-themed NFT platform,  raised US$17.4 million in a round led by Tiger Global in November 2021.Another startup, Lysto, which is launching tools for people to create and sell NFTs, raised US$3 million the same month from backers like Beenext, Flipkart’s Binny Bansal, and Cred’s Kunal Shah.Chennai-based GuardiaLink, a no-code NFT platform, raised US$12 million from Kalaari Capital last December. (The VC firm also invested in WazirX but exited after Binance acquired the firm.)At least three Indian NFT startups have already seen funding in the new year, including NFT social discovery platform Wall and Colexion, a marketplace building a digital museum focused on celebrity NFTs.The third company that has raised funding this year is Chennai-based Diginoor. Teenagers Shaamil Karim and Yash Rathod took a break from college to build the startup, which raised US$1 million in January. Like many in the space, Diginoor is banking on cinema content like iconic film dialogue and film costumes to make NFTs that appeal to movie buffs.The rise of these startups coincides with another trend: Indian celebrities – high-profile actors and athletes – launching their own NFTs. For instance, actor Amitabh Bachchan sold a recital of his late father’s poem, Madhushala, as well as some autographed posters and other memorabilia on BeyondLife for US$966,000 in November.Soon after, BollyCoin closed a pre-sale round which saw US$2 million worth of its tokens sold for NFTs based on actor Salman Khan’s Dabangg film franchise. Meanwhile, physical collectibles and NFTs made from a sports film called 83, which documents India winning the cricket world cup in 1983, sold out under an hour for about US$13,400. Popular local actors like Kamal Hassan and Rajnikanth have also announced their interest to dabble in NFTs through platforms Fantico and Diginoor, respectively.While NFT-related news in the US often piggybacks on the popularity of luxury brands such as Gucci and Balenciaga, actors and sports celebrities are the ones drawing people to the NFT conversation in India, much like how K-pop labels have stoked NFT interest in South Korea“We definitely want more celebrities to be associated with NFTs because this will bring in more crypto adoption,” says Suvarna of WazirX.Bherunda, from a series that taps into the heritage of India’s Wadiyar dynasty / Photo courtesy WaxirXWhile NFT marketplaces offer new artists the chance to experiment, the celebrity-side of the trend banks on the fan base that an actor or sports superstar commands. In some ways, this is just a natural progression of the Indian audience’s adoration of Bollywood-themed memorabilia.“For celebrities, this is about monetizing a legacy they’ve already built,” says Dileep Seinberg, founder and CEO of blockchain and crypto consulting firm ThinkChain.While interest in NFTs feels like it’s been around forever, the trend began to make a lot of noise in India particularly around September 2021, says Kyle Lopez, co-founder of BollyCoin.“I realized that the adoption of NFTs was going to be a lot larger than that of cryptocurrency because of a whole lot of use cases in the real world,” says Lopez, adding that BollyCoin was born because “it was only a matter of time before someone brought blockchain and Bollywood together.”Familiarity can be key to driving adoption of NFTs in India. This explains why WazirX has also tapped into the intersection of the country’s history and royalty to market its platform. In December 2021, it launched a collection of NFTs inspired by the Wadiyar dynasty which once ruled the kingdom of Mysore in India.Even traditional media houses have pulled out their old hits and revamped them as NFTs. For instance, media conglomerate Viacom18 launched a marketplace that will feature NFTs from local pop culture properties such as the prank show Bakra and reality TV show Roadies. Set to go live on February 14, Viacom18’s NFT offerings are meant to be “edgy and quirky,” says Anshul Ailawadi, head of youth, music, and English entertainment at Viacom18.Rangu (left) and Bakra (right) are two NFTs from Viacom18’s Fully Faltoo NFT marketplace / Photo courtesy: Fully Faltoo, Viacom18NFTs offer fans a chance to own a part of something they’re really passionate about, says Ailawadi. “That’s the consumer side. As an organization, this opens up new avenues for us as Web 3.0 becomes a reality.”T-Series, one of India’s most famous music labels which now also doubles as a production house, has also announced the launch of its NFTs and a metaverse,Several India and Bollywood-related metaverses are currently in the works, including one by Singapore-based Fantico, which raised funds from Animoca Brands and other investors in December last year.An open but exclusive worldNFTs have played a big role in making sure the original creator gets their dues and royalties, says Suvarna of WazirX. He primarily sees two kinds of users on the platform: the collectors who choose to keep the artworks and the traders who frequently buy and resell NFTs. Last December, a WazirX customer earned a 2,000% profit after reselling an NFT.Besides being tradable assets, NFTs can be used in the physical world too. Take the Sunburn music festival, for instance. The property partnered with WazirX to drop Sunburn NFTs, which customers could use to attend the actual event.The Green Room is a virtual club founded by BollyCoin / Photo courtesy: BollyCoinIn some cases, people can ask for the NFTs they want: BollyCoin, for instance, is creating a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) to give people voting rights to gauge which celebrities they’d want NFTs from. Those who want to participate in the voting need to buy BollyCoin, but don’t have to buy an NFT.But those who do buy NFTs from special collections have access to The Green Room, a club with exclusive benefits like awards or invitations to virtual events.See more: Meet Singapore’s pioneering NFT creatorsWhile a lot of platforms are joining NFTs with physical collectibles or events, BollyCoin wants to stick to the virtual world. “If we organize events in the real world, the numbers that we’d see would be much smaller than what we can access in the virtual world. The real world limits us,” BollyCoin’s Lopez says.Others see it best to cash in on the physical world. WazirX, for instance, has 10,000 artworks from the CryptoSauga Star Club (CSS Club). Those who buy from this collection will be part of the CSS Club and get perks in select bars and freebies in the physical world, says Suvarna.The one constant with NFT marketplaces is that it’s an ever-evolving space, says Lopez. But one thing’s clear: While NFT platforms are open to all, they’ll also be driven by the exclusivity they offer.Are there really takers?While startups rush to create use cases for NFTs, one wonders if there will be many takers for these projects. The following examples tell us that there might just be a large enough audience.Late last year, Ram Gopal Varma, a popular film director, produced a 90-minute film called Dangerous. Out of the 600,000 tokens the team created for the film, the director and his team held on to 100,000. The rest sold out.As the production house prepares for the film’s release in theaters and online, those who’ve bought its NFTs stand to get a share of the revenues, according to the film’s website.Seinberg says it’s likely that more directors and YouTubers could take this route, as NFT adoption in India’s Tier 2 and 3 towns – much like TikTok when it was legal in the country – is set to rise.Youngsters in these towns increasingly have more spending power, but traditional investment opportunities like buying real estate or stocks or investing in fixed deposits don’t hold the appeal they once used to.And this is beginning to show.India’s small towns have received crypto well: WazirX says sign-ups from these towns have gone up by 2,648% on the platform.Winging It (aka Wing it like Wingnesh) / Photo courtesy: Fully Faltoo, Viacom18“People have learned how to use banking products and make complex videos for social media. Platforms such as OpenSea have already made it easy to mint NFTs,” says Seinberg. What he’s more concerned about is the base price at which NFTs sell for the first time. Friends and families can jack up the price for the first few buys, he says, and the blockchain just records the prices going up.Issues such as interoperability between different blockchains and user interfaces could also pose barriers in the early stages. Novice NFT artists might also find the “gas fee” on ethereum-based platforms as a roadblock.Budding enthusiasts need to be aware of the opportunities and risks associated with digital assets and make informed decisions, says Ailawadi of Viacom18. “There’s an opportunity to build trust in this ecosystem.”Buyers might also not have the inclination to hold on to their NFTs (or hodl, as crypto enthusiasts say) and end up withdrawing their revenues. This may be particularly relevant in India, where earnings from crypto-related assets would attract a 30% tax for sellers. The heavy taxation might discourage those who’re just starting their NFT careers, says Chandran.Still, new experiments continue to play out. A couple in Tamil Nadu, India, recently hosted what’s been billed as Asia’s first wedding in the metaverse. NFTs related to the event are now up for grabs. The wedding invitation, part of the NFT collection, initially sold for US$10 and was then traded at US$4, 450 on BeyondLife Club.Another marker that NFTs are being accepted, if not tolerated, is that comments like “you can save it as a JPEG” are becoming more scarce, says Chandran.“The number of people commenting under my posts that ‘NFTs are a scam’ has decreased,” he says.",Proponents of India’s NFT wave remain bullish about finding novel use cases as crypto assets find takers in the country.,456076,Nikita Puri,True,Terence Lee and Jaclyn Tiu,3,['Premium Content'],"['BollyCoin', 'celebrity NFTs', 'crypto-assets', 'Fully Faltoo', 'NFT clubs', 'NFTs', 'NFTs India', 'Viacom18', 'Vimal Chandran', 'Vimal Chandran NFT', 'WaxirX']",False,,True,True,True,False,9

The vertical attracted a record US$34 billion in venture capital in the second quarter of 2021 alone.In Australia, where the tech sector has grown big enough to generate around US$120 billion for the economy, opportunities for fintech startups – and their investors – abound. In fact, fintech has grown from a US$187 million sector to a US$3 billion industry between 2015 and 2021, according to national fintech association Fintech Australia.Photo credit: Frances GunnAs a result, the country has shot to the top of the 2021 global fintech rankings by data analytics company Findexable. Australia currently sits in sixth place globally and occupies the second spot in Asia Pacific.Nurtured growthThe number of new fintech firms in Australia has grown to 730, which include well-established unicorns like digital payments firm Airwallex, buy now, pay later (BNPL) company Afterpay, and insurance firm Cover Genius.And these players have been making a lot of noise. Afterpay, for example, has driven US$4.5 billion in net benefits to its merchants in 2021 alone, while Cover Genius has recently partnered with Indian ecommerce major Flipkart to provide insurance coverage for furniture products sold on the platform.And despite international headaches over Covid-19, money continues to pour into the sector. Airwallex raised US$100 million from a host of investors in November last year, while green energy-focused point-of-sale company Brighte bagged the same amount a month later.“The fintech industry originally set out to disrupt the traditional financial services industry,” says Stephen Skulley, the senior trade and investment commissioner at Australia’s trade and investment commission, Austrade. “However, in recent years, we’ve seen a shift toward collaboration.”Stephen Skulley, senior trade and investment commissioner at Austrade / Photo credit: AustradeHe points out that initiatives like Westpac Bank’s Reinventure and the National Australia Bank Ventures demonstrate that fintech firms are not separate from Australia’s US$7 trillion financial services sector but are a natural extension of it.All this growth is partly due to the Australian government’s systematic effort to foster the digital ecosystem through regulation, talent, and bilateral connections.Innovation-friendly regulations make it easy for startups to access licenses to offer credit and financial services. And Australia’s partnerships with countries like the UK and Singapore cultivate opportunities for businesses in both territories as well. In June last year, Australia and the Monetary Authority of Singapore started negotiations over a “Fintech Bridge” that would enhance and encourage innovation and business opportunities in the two countries.Australia’s tech talent pool also ranks highly, placing eighth in both the UN’s 2020 Human Development Index and Cisco’s annual Digital Readiness Index, which measures the skills needed to support digital innovation.“Our greatest asset is our creative, resourceful, and enterprising people,” says Skulley. “We use our global ties to connect with the best the world has to offer.”Fintech as a bridge to the regionNot only has the Australian government supported fintech firms in the country, it has also helped startups looking to expand abroad. This is important as areas like Southeast Asia are set to experience significant growth. Case in point, the region’s internet economy is poised to double to US$363 billion by 2025.Skulley points to Australia’s proximity to North and Southeast Asia as the reason the country has been recognized for its “culturally sensitive and multilingual” workforce that understands the importance of these overseas markets. This is an important factor that has helped open doors for businesses in the wider region.“I think a lot of people in Australia do have an understanding of how important the Southeast Asian market and the region is to growth,” says Tasneen Padiath, managing director for Southeast Asia at Australian BNPL firm Zip. “That’s certainly built a lot of bridges.”Tasneen Padiath, managing director for Southeast Asia at Zip / Photo credit: ZipZip conducted an internal study and found that there are 90 million customers in Southeast Asia who want BNPL options, prompting the firm to plan its expansion into the market. Its first foray into Southeast Asia was through an investment in Philippine firm TendoPay, which later led the company to open an office in Singapore.According to Padiath, the transition was smooth due to the support of Singapore’s Economic Development Board and Austrade. Austrade not only provided intelligence and data reports on each market but also the crucial contacts the company needed to hit the ground running.“We shared our plans with Austrade quite openly because we knew that they could be a support for us,” she says. “They were very well-connected to the [Singaporean] government, regulators, and key corporates. Austrade has championed us as we look to make those connections in local markets.”“On the cusp of things”Padiath says that Zip will continue to work together with Austrade as the BNPL company expands throughout Southeast Asia.“I think we’re on the cusp of things in Southeast Asia – we see a lot of opportunity in terms of payments here,” she says. “Cashless transactions have increased 30% to 50% since the pandemic and lending is also forecasted to grow.”Padiath believes that Australian fintech companies are well-placed to take advantage of the opportunities around them. She points out that over 80% of Australian fintech firms have been around for three or more years, a sign of maturity and growth in the sector.“I think it’s pretty obvious that Australian fintechs are becoming internationally competitive now,” she says. “We’ll definitely see more and more global fintechs coming out of Australia.”For Austrade’s Skulley, the future for Australian fintech businesses clearly lies abroad, as more than 70% of companies look to expand internationally, according to a 2021 census by management consultancy Ernst &amp; Young.The Australian government, Skulley says, views the fintech sector as a driver of economic recovery. Over US$6 million has been set aside in the 2020-2021 Federal Budget over the next four years to support the fintech and regtech industries, and the Technology Council of Australia has published a roadmap detailing how it will create a million more tech jobs.“The data shows that when it comes to working internationally, Australian fintech doesn’t simply ‘show potential’ – it is now succeeding internationally and growing,” he affirms.The Australian Trade and Investment Commission (Austrade) is the Australian government’s agency for promoting trade, investment, and international education both at home and abroad.

We break down the big and messy topics of Asia’s tech and startup community. Get the newsletter in your inbox everyday with a Premium subscription.Hi readers,Did you know a hobbyist drone is cheaper than an iPhone 13 in Mayalsia? I had no clue until an acquaintance, who happens to be a drone tech geek, brought it up.Of course, these drones capture visuals and aren’t like the souped-up ones firms use to tackle high risk or tricky jobs like asset inspection or last-mile medicine deliveries.But capturing visuals is how Aerodyne, the world’s top drone services provider, got its start. The drone tech firm was founded in 2014 by Kamarul A. Muhamed, who saw the potential of using drones in bigger jobs after using them in his media production company.Kamarul was in many ways a first mover. He also proved his business model could work after he landed a gig to inspect assets of Petronas, Malaysia’s national oil company.The rest, as they say, is history.But as Aerodyne has cemented itself as the go-to drone tech provider, other upstarts are also looking to wrestle for domestic and regional market share.Larger corporations are also mulling their own in-house drone pilot teams, while others, such as Capital A (formerly AirAsia), have set up pilot-training centers.Aside from entrepreneurial smarts, policy has also been key to the competitive landscape in Malaysia.Both federal and state governments have opened up sites for drone players, including those based overseas such as Singapore’s Garuda Robotics, to test their solutions at the Medini drone test site, considered the largest in Southeast Asia.Can policymakers keep up with demand? We also can’t dismiss privacy and security concerns. These tensions will continue to surface as Malaysia pushes the boundaries of drone tech.For now, Aerodyne seems to be thriving and is on an acquisition spree, with its latest buy bolstering its data analytics and AI capabilities. While looking at a potential listing on the Nasdaq or Tokyo Stock Exchange, it’s also not ruling out a dual listing on Bursa Malaysia.But how long can it be Malaysia’s drone darling?— Emmanuel Samarathisa, journalist at Tech in AsiaTop stories this week1️.

However, Soetoyo’s “high degree of conviction, passion, and market-fit for Indonesia” convinced the firm’s partners to lead Pintu’s initial financing round in March 2019.The Pintu app / Photo credit: PintuToday, as crypto-related sectors like blockchain, Web3, and the metaverse appear to gain steam, Intudo is still an anomaly. It is one of only a handful of conventional tech VCs in the region that has crypto firms in its portfolio.When Pintu raised a US$35 million series A+ funding round in August last year, for example, Intudo was one of only two conventional tech VCs on the company’s cap table of 11 investors. The VC firm was also the only one from Southeast Asia, with Pintu’s nine other backers being US and China-based crypto funds.This is far from an isolated case in the region.Tech in Asia data shows that Southeast Asia’s crypto startups collectively raised funding from over 150 investors last year. Of these backers, only 11 are conventional tech VCs based in the region. These include Singapore’s Vertex Ventures and B Capital, Indonesia’s BRI Ventures and Intudo, and Thailand’s SCB 10X.The rest are mostly global VC firms specializing in the crypto sphere, such as Coinbase Ventures, Pantera Capital, and Alameda Research.Different ball gameFor Intudo founding partner Eddy Chan, the limited participation of local tech VCs in the crypto space is not surprising. After all, the nature of crypto investing is markedly different compared to venture investing.For example, pure-play crypto companies, he explains, often like to build “party rounds,” fundraises where many investors participate but often don’t have a lead backer. These firms seek out investors that can provide access to retail backers and have large global followings.Typically, the allocations into these rounds are small due to the large number of participating investors, which makes it difficult for VCs to build positions and requires that they employ a more index-based approach to investing.The way portfolio companies are managed also differs significantly. Traditional tech VCs usually focus on maintaining and growing positions in promising companies over an extended period until a major event like an IPO or M&amp;A. For crypto firms, however, investors may look to liquidity early on or watch trade activity to time sell-offs, operating more like hedge funds. As is the case, managing these companies requires a different set of skills and timeline expectations.Intudo Ventures team / Photo credit: Intudo VenturesThen, there are also differences in due diligence. In the crypto space, the due diligence process is skewed toward the qualitative analysis of a founder’s capability to build a project or the evaluation of potential token price performance – a far cry from how VCs usually approach a deal. Investments in crypto firms often come before the company has generated any revenue and require significant conviction on a VC’s part before they commit, much like putting money behind a startup raising a pre-seed or seed round.This means “seed-stage investors may have an easier time crossing over [to investing in crypto] than their later-stage peers,” Chan says.While the disparities are apparent, Sequoia India believes crypto projects and businesses share fundamental similarities with tech ventures. For example, Web2 and Web3 companies, which deal in new versions of the World Wide Web, are not too dissimilar in the way they scale and design their product, attract and motivate talent, and how they build a long-term business.“Lots of lessons from Web2 can and should be taken to Web3. And, many of the ideas we see coming to Web3 are from Web2 founders who deeply understand a domain and can apply concepts from both to build something unique,” says Sequoia India managing director Shailesh Lakhani.Several venture capitalists Tech in Asia spoke to point to investment mandates from limited partners (LPs) as a main obstacle to crypto dealmaking.“For regular VCs, crypto is usually not part of the mandate [from their LPs],” says Aldi Adrian Hartanto, partner at Arise, a fund co-managed by MDI Ventures and Finch Capital.In his own fund, Hartanto says he negotiates with LPs to adjust the mandate so his team can invest more freely in crypto and blockchain projects. This is a move he expects several of his peers will take, though not all of them will be successful in getting LP approval.Those that end up sticking with their existing mandates will have their hands tied as far as investing in crypto companies is concerned. Some, however, may invest a minimal amount, which is usually allocated for “opportunistic deals” outside their mandate, he adds.For the most part, Irene Umar, co-founder of blockchain-focused gaming startup YGG SEA recognizes this challenge.A former venture capitalist herself, Umar said many LPs and investment committees of VC firms would be “scratching their heads” at the idea of investing in tokens as opposed to equity.Picking preferred partnersAccording to Umar, the lack of deals in the crypto space from traditional tech VCs may also be down to the startups themselves. Crypto deals are always oversubscribed, she says, so startups have the luxury of picking their preferred investors, and they would usually go for those that have more knowledge in the sector.“Crypto startups would choose investors that can help connect them to exchanges and tokenomic experts, so their tokens can go global. They will be looking at what crypto ecosystem the investor has,” Umar says.This is particularly true of early-stage companies, says Alex Svanevik, co-founder and CEO of Nansen. The crypto analytics startup, for example, sought crypto-native investors for its seed round, hoping they could help the company grow within the industry. In its most recent round, however, Nansen onboarded strategic partners to grow “beyond the crypto bubble and the broader market.” These include top conventional VCs such as Accel, GIC, Andreessen Horowitz, Tiger Global, and SCB 10X.The Nansen team / Photo credit: NansenSvanevik believes that many tech VCs have been slow to move into the crypto sector due to several factors, including regulatory issues as well as a lack of understanding of emerging business models. However, he sees change on the horizon, as 2021 was a tipping point for mainstream VC investment in the space.Pintu’s Soetoyo shares this view. Having worked with Intudo and – more recently – Lightspeed Venture Partners, Soetoyo says non-specialized investors can help grow and scale businesses in valuable ways.“Many non-specialized investors have taken a strong interest in crypto or have even established crypto-specific funds, so I believe we’ll see more involvement from them as well,” he says.Community over capitalOne of the first mainstream VCs in Southeast Asia to set up a crypto fund is Openspace Ventures. The Singapore-based firm – which counts Gojek, Biofourmis, and Halodoc as portfolio companies – launched a US$30 million crypto-focused fund earlier this month. Called Ocular Crypto, the fund invests in fund managers and Web3 projects, including those that deal with DeFi (decentralized finance), the creator/ownership economy, infrastructure, and tooling.While it has a global mandate, Ocular says Openspace’s deep roots in Southeast Asia put it in a unique position to tap into the region’s young crypto ecosystem.Another VC firm that has also embraced Web3 dealmaking, albeit through a different route, is Indonesia’s BRI Ventures, the VC arm of state-owned bank BRI. The VC firm struck a partnership with Binance-backed crypto exchange Tokocrypto in January to launch the first blockchain-focused accelerator in Indonesia. Successful applicants will not only have access to business mentoring but will also receive partnership support and investment opportunities from BRI Ventures, Tokocrypto, and their affiliates.BRI Ventures sealing a partnership with Tokocrypto to launch Indonesia’s first blockchain accelerator program / Photo credit: BRI VenturesFor aspiring crypto startups, working with local VCs like BRI Ventures will help them unearth more local use cases, as well as network and market access, says BRI Ventures CEO Nicko Widjaja.“It’s true that the very nature of Web3 startups makes it easier to be global from day one. But the early group of adopters can be local. This is where the knowledge of local VCs is much more valuable,” says Widjaja, whose firm invested in YGG SEA last year.Ultimately, the status quo remains: Full-fledged crypto VCs have a strong grip on the ecosystem and access to deal flow. For example, the team at Singapore-based Blockchain Founders Fund speaks at an average of three to four blockchain or emerging tech events to increase deal flow, according to its principal Tobias Bauer. Additionally, the firm also receives references to high-quality projects from its over 70 existing portfolio companies.Amid such domination, it becomes important for non-specialized VCs to win the attention, respect, and approval of founders. The best way to do this is through being involved and immersed in the community, Widjaja says.Ocular vice president Amy Zhao seconds this view.“In crypto, capital is not always king, community is,” she says.","Despite crypto and blockchain technology gaining steam, Southeast Asia’s tech VC firms have been slow to jump on the bandwagon.",586001,Ardi Wirdana,True,Putra Muskita and Jaclyn Tiu,0,"['Analysis', 'Blockchain', 'Premium Content']","['blockchain', 'Blockchain Founders Fund', 'crypto', 'fintech', 'Indonesia', 'Intudo Ventures', 'Ocular Crypto', 'Openspace Ventures', 'pintu', 'web3', 'ygg']",False,,True,True,True,False,7
732155,2022-02-11T02:00:02,2022-02-11T05:15:48,Navigating the changing digital advertising landscape,navigating-changing-digital-advertising-landscape,post,"With the pandemic pushing consumption online, digital marketing has reached its peak. More money is being spent on digital marketing and advertising than ever before, and it has overtaken all other formats for the first time in 2021.Before digital, advertising was more art than science: Marketers were heavily reliant on “impressions” as a measurement of an ad’s effectiveness based on how many times it’s seen.“Everything was based on an impression, like how many people drove past a billboard,” observes Michael Hahn, CEO and founder of digital advertising platform ReverseAds.ReverseAds founder and CEO Michael Hahn / Photo credit: ReverseAdsWhile impressions are important because they signal the beginning of an interaction with a customer, marketers soon dropped cost-per-click (CPC) models and moved towards those optimized for actual sales or conversions.These new “attribution-based” models were made possible by the emergence of cookie and tracking technologies like Facebook Pixel and Google’s AdWords, which allow marketers to glean specific consumer data.A complicated spaceHowever, the evolution of adtech has led to its fair share of problems.Greater awareness around data privacy has led the industry to shift away from third-party cookies, presenting an entirely different challenge for advertisers left in the dark.Another problem is attribution, a key metric that helps advertisers figure out how to charge their clients by tracking where certain actions occur during a user journey. The issue is further compounded by the sheer number of digital ad players out there, as well as factors like multi-click attribution, click fraud, and accidental clicks.However, some of the biggest challenges facing marketers can be summed up in two names: Facebook and Google.Over the last 20 years, these companies have become the “default option.” In 2021 alone, these tech titans accounted for over half of global digital ad revenues outside of China, alongside retail giant Amazon.Hahn likens Facebook and Google to “public utilities” because of their ubiquity. With their huge digital footprints, Facebook and Google are continuously engaging users across other platforms such as Instagram and YouTube.A digital ad duopolyAs a result of this reality, both companies have the power to set prices, resulting in reduced returns for advertisers. This duopoly also has little incentive to make changes to their platforms that benefit anyone but themselves.Google and Facebook’s “walled gardens” – environments where the platforms control users’ access to content and services – are yielding fewer advantages for advertisers than before. Social platforms like Facebook don’t drive actual product sales, especially for considered purchases like business-to-business services, cars, or luxury goods, which require more thought and involve a high degree of financial or emotional risk and reward.“Consumers browsing social media aren’t in the mindset to make serious purchases,” points out Hahn.Photo credit: 123RFIn fact, even a search maverick like Google isn’t meeting the needs of brands because a lot of search activity is moving elsewhere, such as ecommerce platforms.Another issue marketers face is the pricing models imposed by Google and Facebook. Facebook frequently changes its algorithm, making it difficult for brands to reach their target audiences. In turn, this uncertainty essentially forces advertisers to buy the algorithm’s favor.Meanwhile, Google’s bidding-based model drives advertisers to pay a fee for every gleaned impression – without the promise of conversions. ReverseAds says that some of its clients like German automaker BMW have had to spend up to half of their budgets just to ensure that they stay ahead of the competition in terms of search rankings.“You shouldn’t have to do so in a just internet,” says Hahn. “It’s almost like paying the internet gods to allow your brand’s name to come up.”The first true alternative to GoogleFrom the beginning, ReverseAds was designed to be a true alternative to Google in the face of privacy concerns.“We didn’t want to build a product that was dependent on tracking users’ every movement online,” he recalls.ReverseAds’ “cookie-less” technology leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to predict consumers’ behavior before presenting ads at the right time and the right place.Hahn explains that ReverseAds opens up opportunities “after search,” which refers to the time after a user’s first keyword search, when they leave the search engine and enter the open web. Advertising on the open web is based on predictions of the user’s path to purchase made via ReverseAds’s patented Keywords Assignment Algorithm.“The step after search – after you leave Google’s properties – is just as important or even more so in the purchase process for long-consideration products,” Hahn says.Photo credit: ReverseAdsIn a head-to-head comparison, the cost of purchasing the same keywords in after search is roughly half of what Google charges, leading to lower prices for advertisers for an equal amount of value. Furthermore, instead of relying on traditional metrics like CPC, ReverseAds has pioneered the “cost-per-intent” (CPIn) model​​, where advertisers are only charged for quality clicks.Hahn explains that by using CPIn, ReverseAds can measure the quality of a click by applying the Internet Advertising Bureau’s (IAB’s) rigorous 22-second standard, where a click is only measured if a user spends at least that much time on a website, visits three pages on the site, or reaches 100% scroll depth on the landing page, enabling meaningless or accidental engagement to be automatically weeded out.He says that the CPIn model allows brands “to grow a big database of users who actually demonstrate real intent without paying extremely high rates just to buy on a conversion basis.” The firm also focuses on ensuring ads are shown to users at a time when they are receptive to them.Changing the ad experienceAs the industry gradually matures, Hahn emphasizes the increased desire for privacy and personalization in the internet experience of users, which in turn will lead to an “ad-less” future.“I know that sounds strange, but we think advertising has to stop being advertising,” he says. “Users are going to continue demanding their privacy online, and advertising is going to have to be a benefit, not a nuisance.”Hahn also predicts that customers’ disdain for ads will naturally push more advertisers to innovate new kinds of predictive engagement models that reimagine the core of advertising itself.“We’re really working to change the experience of what an ad is,” he concludes.ReverseAds is building the world’s first true alternative to Google search ads by leveraging artificial intelligence and predictive keyword assignment technology to help businesses reclaim their online advertising ROI and connect with valuable, high-intent users.Learn more about how ReverseAds’s revolutionary cost-per-intent model can help you reap the best returns on your online ads.This content was produced by Tech in Asia Studios, which connects brands with Asia’s tech community.

Informative and witty, it gives you everything you need to know to start your day. Choose the Daily Newsletter option to get it  delivered to your inbox or read it right here on our site.Hello reader,Slightly more than a year ago, my friend and I decided to build our own desktop computers, which would involve buying the various components separately and assembling them ourselves.Due to the pandemic and ongoing supply chain constraints, finding graphics cards at reasonable prices became incredibly difficult. While I was lucky enough to quickly find my own card, my friend didn’t fare so well.To help him source for his own component, I scoured every third-party marketplace I could think of, eventually finding a person on Carousell who was selling a graphics card at non-scalper prices.In today’s story, we explore the classified platform’s talks with Singapore-based proptech firm 99 Group to expand the former’s slate of offerings. Should the deal go through, it could prove a timely boost to Carousell, which is looking at a potential public listing in the US in the near future.Today we look at:What the potential acquisition of 99 Group spells for CarousellRevolut’s US$45 million entry into the Indian marketOther newsy highlights such as the collaboration between YG Entertainment and Binance as well as SoftBank’s less-than-stellar Q3 results.Premium summaryWill the shoe fit?Image credit: Timmy LoenI used to think that Carousell was only good for selling used clothes or other smaller second-hand items. But I was pleasantly surprised to find that it had way more to offer than that. With the acquisition of a proptech platform in the cards, Carousell’s reach could grow even further. The move could become the cherry on top of the company’s expansion gambit into other markets such as automobiles and luxury goods.Show me the money: According to two people familiar with the matter, Carousell’s acquisition of 99 Group could take the form of a US$150 million cash-and-stock deal. Should it happen, the deal could take 99 Group’s valuation far above its current standing of US$83.6 million, according to VentureCap Insights. Carousell, on the other hand, last saw its valuation pegged at a little over US$1 billion.Beefing up: According to one of the sources, Carousell’s desire to strengthen its portfolio ahead of a potential US listing spurred the company to engage in talks of the acquisition, which could happen as early as this quarter. This is just the latest in Carousell’s string of expansion efforts, which includes the acquisition of several firms such as Ox Street, Caarly, OneShift, OLX Philippines, and 701Search.The other side of the coin: The deal could prove especially fruitful for 99 Group too. With this sale, the company would have the required backing to boost its expansion in markets such as Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam. Its sale to Carousell could also help it shore up its competitive advantages against its rival PropertyGuru, which operates in the same markets and plans to go public in June via a SPAC merger with Bridgetown 2 Holdings.Read more: Carousell in talks for $150m acquisition of 99 GroupStartup spotlightSetting foot in IndiaImage credit: Timmy LoenUK-based Revolut is looking to enter India with a bang, having set aside nearly US$45 million for its expansion into the country. The company will be using its war chest for product development and operating expenses, as well as to hire nearly 300 employees by the end of this year.Money, money, money: The fintech company specializes in mobile banking, card payments, money remittance, and foreign exchange. Last year, it raised US$800 million in a funding round co-led by SoftBank and Tiger Global, which took the company’s valuation to US$33 billion.A full meal: For its first course in India, the firm intends to lead with its flagship payments and remittance product, which will allow customers to transfer money within the country and abroad. Next, Revolut will launch a trading product, enabling users to invest in both domestic and international markets. And finally, the company will introduce its lending service for both B2B and B2C consumers.Stepping out: As part of its expansion, Revolut is also building a product and engineering hub in India, the first time it’s doing so outside its home base in the UK. This hub will help the company serve India and the rest of the Asia-Pacific region – the firm currently has a presence in Singapore, Australia, and Japan, and it is also looking to launch in New Zealand in the future.In partnership withWhat’s more important, the startup business idea or go-to-market strategy?Sustaining the success of a startup is like cooking a complicated stew: You need to add in many ingredients to get that special flavor. For startups to keep thriving, it usually boils down to two main elements: the product idea and the go-to-market (GTM) strategy. The question is, which of the two is more important?For a product idea to have real and sustainable change as well as success at scale, it requires the right GTM strategy, and startups can pick up tips on creating one from Fast Forward with HPE. The initiative is a multistage B2B startup competition from Hewlett Packard Enterprise that’s specially crafted to help scale and grow early-stage tech startups across Asia Pacific. It wants to foster a culture of growth, scalability, and sustenance by providing the next generation of digital disruptors with GTM strategy development and ecosystem support.Tune in to watch the third and final episode of the competition, in which the four finalist startups go through one last round of grilling by the judges to determine the winners.Quick bytes1️⃣ iAcquireAustralia-based mobile gaming firm iCandy has acquired a majority stake in Southeast Asian game developer and publisher Storms for US$5.7 million.

732260,2022-02-10T09:17:43,2022-02-10T09:18:57,Exclusive: Bukalapak co-founders back 🇮🇩 B2B fintech startup amid funding spree,exclusive-bukalapak-cofounders-indonesian-b2b-fintech-startup-funding-spree,post,"Init 6, the VC firm led by Bukalapak co-founders Achmad Zaky and Nugroho “Xinuc” Herucahyono, has invested in Monit, an Indonesian B2B fintech startup. The details of the deal were not disclosed, but Monit said it has also raised funding from 1982 Ventures and an unnamed VC, taking its total seed funding to a seven-figure sum.Monit describes itself as an “integrated experience,” combining payments, expenses, cash, and corporate cards. In a conversation with Tech in Asia, Init 6 likened Monit to US-based giant Brex and expects the Indonesian startup to be a “gamechanger in the B2B fintech sector.”Monit co-founders Rizki Aditya (left) and Teddy Tjahjadi / Photo credit: MonitZaky, who built Bukalapak from scratch to become an ecommerce unicorn, says he and his team were often left “frustrated” when managing the company’s digital expenses. While corporate credit cards are the ideal solution, they are difficult to obtain for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) – like Bukalapak was in its early days.“From that experience, we believe that many companies, specifically SMBs, face the same problem,” he says. “Monit can help them become more productive and efficient by providing an all-in-one expense management system, including corporate credit cards for payment.”The Monit deal follows a quietly busy 2021 for Init 6. While only four deals were publicly announced, the VC firm says it made 15 investments in total.Banking services, minus the hassleBusinesses can use Monit to pay for bills, manage reimbursements and disbursements, and issue corporate credit cards. The company was established by Rizki Aditya and Teddy Tjahjadi, who both had stints at startups in the US.Monit, which mostly targets ecommerce players and tech companies, only started acquiring clients in January. But in order to roll out its corporate credit card offering, the startup has sealed strategic partnership deals with major card networks Mastercard and Visa as well as regional bank issuers CIMB Niaga and United Overseas Bank.A screenshot of Monit’s product / Photo credit: MonitAside from banks, several startups In Indonesia provide related solutions for businesses. HR platform Mekari, for example, has launched Mekari Pay, which gives companies access to all payment methods via a single digital wallet. Meanwhile, peer-to-peer transfer startup Flip has also tapped into the B2B space, where it simplifies mass disbursement and international fund transfers for companies.Monit, however, seems to be the only one focusing solely on the banking needs of SMBs.“Monit is not trying to be a bank, yet we are more than just an accounts payable tool. We see the future as a marketplace where businesses can discover, manage, and use multiple financial instruments – bank transfer, cards, savings, etc. – powered by a single experience,” says Rizki.The company concedes that it does draw its inspiration from Brex, which grew to a billion-dollar business in just two years and is now valued at over US$12 billion. However, Rizki says the two companies differ in their approach. While Brex encourages businesses to spend more by incentivizing employees with point-based rewards, Monit’s software is designed to help companies spend less, thus enabling them to generate more profit.The fintech startup will use the proceeds from the seed funding to hire more talent and develop its products. Rizki says the next product will be focused on treasury, so Monit will partner with banks and financial institutions to help companies get an investment return from their idle cash.Silently prolificFor Init 6, Monit counts as its second publicly announced investment this year. In January, the VC firm said it has backed Showwcase, a developer community platform based in the US.Though Init 6 only unveiled four deals (Codemi, Eduka, Moni, and ID CloudHost) in 2021, the firm says the total was 15. Among the investments that went unannounced were cloud management startup Awanio and content creator platform Trakteer.This year, Init 6 is looking to double its existing portfolios.Init 6 founders Nugroho “Xinuc” Herucahyono and Achmad Zaky (third and fourth from left) with the team from IDCloudHost / Photo credit: IDCloudHostThe firm says that it is still investing out of the pockets of its founders. Nevertheless, Zaky and Xinuc considering to elevate the fund to a conventional limited partner-general partner (LP-GP) structure.“We’re still deploying our own money, because we believe that skin in the game is very important in this VC ecosystem. However, we also believe that if we want to go big and far, we will need more external partners,” Zaky explains.Going bigger and further would be a necessity for Init 6, given the increasingly crowded and competitive venture capital game in Indonesia.But given that both Zaky and Xinuc are proven local unicorn builders, perhaps that’s enough to set them apart from almost all other VCs in the region.“We’ve had an experience building a startup from scratch until it became a unicorn. That experience, we think, could be the most valuable value-add that we can share to our portfolio companies,” Zaky says.","The investment in Monit marks Init 6’s third funding this year, following a quietly prolific 2021 for the Indonesia-based VC firm.",586001,Ardi Wirdana,True,Putra Muskita and Eileen C.

Delivered every Thursday via email and through the Tech in Asia website, this free newsletter breaks down the biggest stories and trends in ecommerce. If you’re not a subscriber, get access by registering here.Hi there,2 million.That’s the number of shipments Indonesian startup J&amp;T Express processed per day in 2020, according to research by venture builder Momentum Works.Despite achieving a hefty US$20 billion valuation within six years of launch and heading for an IPO in Hong Kong, J&amp;T Express hasn’t received the attention it deserves. It’s one of the few Indonesian tech companies that aggressively target overseas markets – a trick that even super app Gojek hasn’t mastered.Ecommerce logistics is a tough nut to crack, especially in last-mile delivery. Competition is intense and, generally, it’s hard for logistics players to stand out. It’s game over if these companies don’t have the scale.J&amp;T Express, however, has one crucial advantage: Its roots can be traced to Oppo, the Chinese smartphone company. J&amp;T stands for Jet and Tony, named after its co-founders. Notably, Jet Lee was also Oppo’s Indonesia CEO and Tony Chen founded the smartphone maker in 2004.The Oppo network has helped J&amp;T expand regionally across Southeast Asia and establish a strong foothold in China, a “red ocean” market.But J&amp;T needs to find new sources of growth. Next on its radar are the Middle East and Latin America, where it can lean on a potential partnership with fellow Southeast Asian firm Shopee.Is J&amp;T Express’ global expansion the real deal or does it merely serve the narrative for its upcoming IPO? In this week’s Big Story, my colleague, Jofie Yordan, takes a look at all the cards that J&amp;T Express has to play with to survive and thrive.Our Hot Take this week highlights the power of the marketplace, which in the case of Amazon has grown to become one of its biggest cash cows in 2021. But the question remains as to whether this will tempt the US tech giant to take a crack at Asia again.— HuongTHE BIG STORYThe keys to J&amp;T Express’ rapid global expansionImage credit: Timmy LoenJ&amp;T Express made waves by capitalizing on its ties to Oppo and Shopee. But will that be enough to drive global expansion?THE HOT TAKEAmazon marketplace’s indisputable powerPhoto credit: 123rf.comHere’s what happened:Amazon’s third-party sellers now account for 25% of U.S. ecommerce, clocking a gross merchandise value (GMV) of US$390 billion in 2021, according to estimates from MarketplacePulse.The figure has even surpassed that of Amazon Retail (GMV of US$210 billion in 2021), which handles goods sold by Amazon directly to consumers.The Amazon Marketplace consists of millions of online businesses worldwide that sell through Amazon. While they have delivered stellar growth in recent years, these businesses are subject to rules and restrictions set by Amazon.Here’s our take:While Amazon Web Services, the firm’s cloud computing service, has received high praise from analysts, Amazon Marketplace remains the most profitable part of the ecommerce giant’s retail operations. In this segment, Amazon doesn’t own any inventory and receives a hefty fee on the nearly $400 billion in gross merchandise value it handles, as this Forbes analysis pointed out.Despite the impressive numbers, Amazon’s success in ecommerce is not global, with around 60% of its US$469.8 billion in net sales in 2021 coming from North America alone.Notably, it’s not the market leader in any Asian market.Even though it was an early entrant in China, Amazon failed to overcome the stiff competition from Chinese giants Alibaba and JD.com, and eventually shut down its Chinese domestic ecommerce business in 2019.In Singapore – the only Southeast Asian country where Amazon operates – it’s trailing behind Sea Group’s Shopee and Alibaba’s Lazada both in terms of web traffic and app traffic, according to iPrice’s data for Q3, 2021. Moreover, in late 2019, Amazon also skipped out on an opportunity to gain a foothold in Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam after the firm ceased talks to acquire a stake in super app Gojek.However, with recent signs of significant momentum in Amazon’s third-party marketplace, is the time ripe for Amazon to have another serious crack at Asian markets where it has struggled?In Southeast Asia, Shopee and Tokopedia have demonstrated the importance of implementing the consumer-to-consumer model from the start, which some analysts say is more suitable for acquiring buyers and sellers quickly in emerging markets.Image credit: Timmy LoenThere are hurdles aplenty, but the rise of third-party sellers globally might mean it’s time for Amazon to up its game in Asia.Still, small businesses fear being priced out and Tech in Asia previously analyzed why the multiplatform strategy – selling both on marketplaces and independent websites – is the way to go in Southeast Asia.For Asia-based sellers, Amazon’s biggest appeal is its ability to connect them with global buyers.“Our success depends on the success of our selling partners,” an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement to Tech in Asia. The person added that the company is committed to “helping sellers grow and reach a global audience easily” through its 20 country stores around the world, giving them access to over 200 million of Amazon Prime’s paying members worldwide.However, established regional ecommerce players like Shopee are well stocked to compete. Shopee’s significant inroads in Europe and Latin America can give third-party sellers another window to reach customers overseas.Amazon often thrives on countering skepticism. So it’s hard to see why it doesn’t want to grab a bigger slice of Asia’s US$2 trillion ecommerce market.— ShravanthNEWS YOU SHOULD KNOWCheck out Tech in Asia’s coverage of the ecommerce scene here.1️⃣ Carousell, the classifieds major, is in talks to acquire Singapore-based proptech 99.co for US$150 million.2️⃣ TikTok has launched Dmonstudio, a fast-fashion ecommerce platform to compete with Shein.3️⃣ Indonesia-based e-grocery startup HappyFresh wants to open 100 dark stores across Southeast Asia in the coming years after running trials in early 2021.4️⃣ Vietnam’s social commerce startup Selly has raised US$2.6 million in its pre-series A round.

So when Shopee entered the fray that year, few took notice.Despite its initially unimposing presence, the online shopping platform quickly clawed its way through the ranks. Bolstered by Garena’s war chest, Sea’s timely listing, and Tencent’s backing, Shopee was able to outspend its competition at every turn, drawing customers to its platform like flies to honey.And its strategy paid off. Within five short years, Shopee dethroned Lazada and became Southeast Asia’s top ecommerce platform.In this episode of The Playbook, we discuss Shopee’s bid for the crown as Southeast Asia’s ecommerce king, the strategic factors that enabled the company to get the jump on its competition, and why the incumbents of the time failed to halt its rise to the top.",The ecommerce giant’s conquest of Southeast Asia began with a mix of strategic timeliness and an effective marketing strategy.,661107,Candice Lee,True,,0,"['Ecommerce', 'Featured Video', 'Premium Content', 'TIA Originals', 'Videos']","['app', 'asia ecommerce', 'cross-border shopping', 'Ecommerce', 'shopee']",False,,True,True,True,True,1

The company said that its revenue has “increased substantially,” but it declined to give specific numbers.While Zimplistic didn’t divulge details of its financials for 2021, this comes as a turnaround two years after it burned into its cash reserves due to mounting losses.A Rotimatic machine / Photo credit: ZimplisticIn October 2020, investment vehicle Light Ray Holdings acquired Zimplistic after its previous investors rushed for the exit door. While the ownership changed, the management remained under husband and wife founder duo Rishi Israni and Pranoti Nagarkar Israni. The company’s turmoil drove the founders and new owners to create a plan for financial sustainability in 2021.“Once the new investors came in, we all had a series of sessions to zero in on the execution plan going forward,” Pranoti tells Tech in Asia. This included improvements on its product, investments in its user experience, its plan for a launch in India, and its strategy for consumables.A rush that led to regretIn 2018, Zimplistic was battling mounting losses and falling revenue, according to its regulatory filings.At the same time, the company was burning through its cash reserves. The net cash used in its operating activities during that year was US$19.9 million, while it had raised a total of only US$11.6 million by 2018, according to VentureCap Insights data.The rush to do a full rollout of the Rotimatic product seemed to be the main cause of the startup’s losses.“With the benefit of hindsight, we can say that the decision of selling 21,000 machines in our first year was not the best thing to do. I think we were overenthusiastic about the launch and in hindsight we should have tempered our enthusiasm about taking a unique product to a market and have had a balanced approach towards a rollout,” says Pranoti.She explains that it was supply chain costs that impacted Zimplistic, as the company did not scale it in the first year of Rotimatic’s launch. “Operationally, it takes time to set up and scale the supply chain,” she adds.Zimplistic co-founders Rishi Israni (left) and Pranoti Nagarkar Israni / Photo source: ZimplisticPranoti shares that if the company were to launch the product again, it would do a staggered rollout with a subset of geographies. She says that this would have led to a better experience for all the stakeholders, especially the users.To make matters worse, the company was pummeled by the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdowns in 2020, which disrupted its supply chains. Because of this, Zimplistic slowed down manufacturing at its plant in Malaysia.The startup shares that it still deals with high supply chain costs as well as bottlenecks from the large demand that its shipping partners experience. “Raw material is still in shortage, so the challenge for my manufacturing and procurement team is to constantly ensure the lead time can meet production schedules. In some cases, we have had to work to find alternative molders or manufacturers of parts as the supplier shut down operations,” Pranoti adds.The pandemic not only impacted Zimplistic’s supply chain of raw materials, but also the delivery and returns of its products.The startup offers a seven-day replacement guarantee for any hardware issues that its customers face across its 20 markets. It also doesn’t have a service center. The team analyzes the Rotimatic machine to know if it is a hardware or software problem.While the team can solve any software problems remotely, the company offers a replacement of the machine for hardware issues.Units that are returned to the company are refurbished and resold as “remanufactured” products at a lower price. While a brand new Rotimatic is priced at US$1,299, the refurbished machine is sold at US$999.Slowing the cash burnZimplistic’s losses and cash burn were reduced in 2019 and 2020.Similarly, its loss before interest and tax dropped by half to US$10.5 million in 2019 and was further reduced by over 2x to US$4.8 million in 2020.The startup achieved this by reducing its staff count by over half. It currently has about 50 people across its offices in Singapore and India, including outsourced customer service agents – a sharp drop from its headcount of 110 earlier.Zimplistic is now looking to expand its engineering, marketing, and customer experience teams.The company also reduced its raw material costs without impacting the quality of the Rotimatic. The company says that its new owner, Light Ray Holdings, supported Zimplistic in this regard, as the investment vehicle brought in its existing contacts and relationships to help the startup manage optimization of raw material costs.The Singapore-based firm also applied automation to reduce costs. “For example, we designed an auto troubleshooter for users to use to help improve the user experience and have a faster turnaround time,” adds Pranoti.While operating losses improved, the company’s revenue took a beating as it fell by 5x from 2018 to 2020. In 2020, the figure stood at just US$3.9 millionBesides cutting costs, Zimplistic further improved its customer experience by working closely with its call center partner to enhance agent training, processes, policies, and tools. Pranoti says that this increased word of mouth and helped in conversions.According to the company, Rotimatic is now in more than 75,000 households across different markets.Homecoming for the Rotimatic?Zimplistic plans to make an entry into the Indian market, the home of the roti or flatbread.The company says that it has seen a surge in interest for the Rotimatic in India during the pandemic. Pranoti shares that the startup became aware of this as people from India were either buying the product from other countries or having it shipped to India by friends and relatives overseas.A Rotimatic machine / Photo credit: ZimplisticThe company has already received pre-orders for the Rotimatic in India and will soon begin delivery of the products.The rise in demand from India may be attributed to the pandemic restricting access to cooks into wealthier households and the demand for freshly-made rotis. While ready-to-eat rotis are available in the market, there are many who prefer the healthier option of having a roti made from scratch with their own ingredients.“Roti is a staple for more than 150 million families in India, of which we believe that 11 million would be directly an addressable market size for a solution like Rotimatic that is fully automatic and one of its kind. The only alternative that the consumer has right now is frozen, ready-to-eat, or half-cooked rotis sold in supermarkets or restaurants,” explains Pranoti.The Rotimatic is sold at 111,000 rupees (about US$1,483) in India, which is a bit higher than its selling price elsewhere due to the country’s 18% goods and service tax charges. However, even when excluding these taxes, the price is still expensive for an individual in India earning a middle-income salary who is looking to buy a cooking appliance.In comparison, a multifunction oven is considered the highest-priced cooking appliance in the country, but it costs nearly half of what a Rotimatic is priced at.This means that Zimplistic’s product is meant for a much higher-income household earning around 250,000 rupees to 300,000 rupees (US$3,300 to US$4,000) per month, which is why the company is targeting families with two earning members aged between 35 and 45.“We are shipping across India, so it will be interesting to see the demand from the metros versus the rest of India,” says Pranoti.She adds that 2022 for Zimplistic is all about establishing the brand in India and improving the user experience in all markets. The company is looking to expand into more countries once Covid restrictions are eased and the after-effects of supply chain challenges are resolved.Currency converted from Indian rupee to US dollar: US$1 = 74.83 rupees.","After mounting losses and high cash burn led to Zimplistic’s sale over a year ago, the company has turned around its financials in 2021.",449210,Collin Furtado,True,Terence Lee and Lorenzo Kyle Subido,0,"['Consumer Tech', 'News', 'Premium Content', 'Robotics']","['earnings', 'hardware startups', 'India', 'Pranoti Nagarkar Israni', 'rishi israni', 'robotics', 'roti maker', 'rotimatic', 'Singapore', 'zimplistic']",False,,True,True,True,False,6

The city-state has seen many major tech companies establish offices on its shores, and startups are the rising stars of its business scene, having raised more than US$11 billion of investment capital in 2021.Photo credit: cegoh / PixabayThough big tech corporations have a ton of resources at their disposal, many of them suffer from the same problems as their non-tech counterparts. Staffing skews big, and they often move slower, thanks to the many processes and rules at play.For employees, it’s easy to feel lost and isolated from the company’s greater vision, which is why many are skipping “traditional” careers for a more adventurous foray into the startup scene.Goodbye, corporate lifeFor Rene Tan, the head of pre-sales for smart city infrastructure at Envision Digital – a provider of sustainability software – joining the startup gave him an opportunity to explore new and emerging technologies at a larger scale.In 2015, he left a job at Malaysian satellite television company Astro for telecommunications firm Singtel to pursue bigger opportunities and a role in the island state’s developing tech economy, focused on emerging technology such as the internet of things (IoT). Soon after, he joined Envision, lured by the firm’s track record as the biggest renewable energy platform in the world that uses artificial intelligence of things (AIoT).Rene Tan, head of pre-sales for smart city infrastructure at Envision Digital / Photo credit: Envision Digital“I was in awe because at Singtel, we were still figuring out where we were going with IoT – Envision was already there,” he says.Tan was attracted to Envision’s technological capabilities and active commitment to the global climate change agenda, but the biggest draw was the firm’s “clarity in direction” when it came to its solutions’ specific domain at the intersection of AIoT and sustainability.“Oftentimes in technology, the company is just meant to be a broad platform that allows for various domains and industries to come in,” he says. “However, this means you end up being a master of none. Envision has this specific connection to sustainability, which gives it focus and helps to drive its growth.”Coming in from the outsideFor Han Jiamin, the team lead of ecommerce logistics community platform Parcel Monitor, startups provided an opportunity for her to make a pivot from a staid professional career into an exciting role in tech. Parcel Monitor is a unit under package-tracking startup Parcel Perform.Armed with a law degree, Han worked for a year and a half at a major law firm in Singapore. However, she soon found that she was more drawn to tech’s forward-looking perspective, and she made the leap into the industry by joining AI solutions provider Taiger as its seventh employee.“I started in sales, but, being in a startup, I also did marketing, events, and was also co-legal counsel,” she recalls.Han Jiamin, team lead of Parcel Monitor, Parcel Perform / Photo credit: Parcel PerformAfter Taiger, Han worked with integration-as-a-service provider Dell Boomi to get experience with working in a big organization. However, she found that the highly-specialized corporate culture didn’t suit her.“You lose that connection with technology, which is what drew me to the tech space from the start,” she muses. “I have to be excited about a company’s value proposition and the problem it’s trying to solve in order to join, and I wanted to be part of that development process.”Soon after, Han joined Parcel Perform, and she shares that she was drawn to the startup because of its clear value proposition of improving the logistics experience, as well as its status as an early-stage startup. For her, the company’s nascent stage meant there were more opportunities to grow, learn, and contribute.“The company is young and growing fast, so there will be plenty of opportunities for you to make an impact,” she says. “A year in a startup can give you so much more knowledge and experience compared to the same amount of time in a specialized role in a large organization.”Wearing many hatsDespite its reputation as a “sexy industry,” as Han puts it, there is no doubt that startup life is grueling. Both Tan and Han say that their forays into startup culture were characterized by heavy workloads and the need to play multiple roles.Tan doesn’t just work on presales solution marketing for Envision, but also product innovation, go-to-market strategization, and project implementation. Similarly, at Parcel Perform, Han not only acts as the team lead for Parcel Monitor as she is also involved in product development, content, marketing, and partnership strategy.While wearing many hats in a business is tiring, Han sees this as an opportunity to learn more about a startup and develop quickly.Han with her colleagues at Parcel Perform in 2020, prior to the Covid-19 pandemic / Photo credit: Parcel Perform“I didn’t have any formal education or experience in product management, but this also made my learning process a lot more focused and productive,” she says. “I learned based on what I needed to apply immediately.”Tan echoes Han’s views, saying that working across functions has given him a lot of opportunities to grow, though there are some drawbacks to running a tight ship with few resources.“You can’t have an individual step out or you disrupt the entire process,” he says. “A lot of us had to pick up the slack, and I personally learned a lot from plugging holes everywhere.”“Fail fast, learn fast, scale fast”Despite their different routes, both Han and Tan point to similar benefits from working at startups. For one, startups are better at making speedy decisions and pivoting from failed endeavors, unlike large corporations that prize perfect planning over all.“The benefit of startups is that decisions are made fast, then we iterate and move on,” Tan says.Tan with his colleagues at InnovFest Unbound / Photo credit: Envision Digital“What I’ve learned is that if it’s not successful right from the start, it’s okay,” Han shares. “Fail fast, learn fast – but also scale fast.”Han also points to the fact that startups offer individuals the flexibility to define their own career paths and professional growth. Parcel Perform opened the door for her to gain the product management experience she lacked, and in doing so, it empowered her to define what her role would be.As a result of that belief and support, Han was able to launch Parcel Monitor within months of joining.Tan says that the benefits of his startup experience have been the shift away from a hierarchical corporate culture – where processes often trump people – and the opportunity to experiment with cutting-edge technology. He’s had the opportunity to develop new and innovative solutions for many organizations, including multinational corporations and the Singapore government.A path of many optionsBoth Tan and Han stress the importance of ensuring that a person’s values and vision align with those of a startup they plan to join.“Startup life is not easy,” says Han. “There’s going to be a lot of uncertainties and undefined processes, but if you’re able to appreciate where the company is going, it will help you navigate those initial uncertainties.”For Tan, Envision’s commitment to tackling climate change was key to his decision to join, but that might not be the same for others. In his view, an employee needs to first assess the risks of each industry as well as the qualities and leadership of a startup.“You can make an assessment based on the resumes of the leaders, but I think it’s also very important to note how purpose-driven the leadership is when working toward its goals,” he says.Han advises aspiring startup workers to reach out to people in the space or company before applying to make sure goals and visions are aligned.“I think the best way to understand a startup’s culture and how it works is really through the people inside,” she says. “When you talk to people in the industry, you understand what they need, what you’re missing, and it might be your gateway to your next job as well.”The Infocomm Media Development Authority develops and regulates the converging infocomm and media sectors in a holistic way, creating a dynamic sector filled with opportunities for growth through an emphasis on talent, research, innovation, and enterprise.Startups such as Parcel Perform and Envision Digital offer tech talent avenues to explore new horizons and make a difference.

731948,2022-02-10T01:55:54,2022-02-10T05:02:49,The keys to J&T Express’ rapid global expansion,jt-express-rapid-global-expansion,post,"Indonesia’s logistics firms have scaled new heights as the country’s ecommerce space continues to thrive. But one company appears to be separating itself from the pack: the China-connected J&amp;T Express.A report from venture builder Momentum Works found that J&amp;T processed 2 million shipments per day in 2020. Not only did it outperform fellow startups like SiCepat Ekspres and Ninja Xpress, but it also outpaced legacy company JNE – perhaps a more impressive feat.But unlike its Indonesian peers, J&amp;T has loftier ambitions. Apart from expanding to other parts of Southeast Asia as well as China, it’s also eyeing the Middle East and Latin America.That has led to some eye-popping numbers. The company raised US$2.5 billion at a valuation of US$20 billion in November 2021 as it plans an IPO in Hong Kong sometime this year.J&amp;T Express employees preparing packages / Photo credit: J&amp;T ExpressHowever, a global expansion remains a tough task. In China, for instance, J&amp;T has to deal with fierce competition from incumbents and a price war that it had ignited.The co-founder of a J&amp;T competitor observes that there’s little that separates logistics players from each other – at least from an operational or business model standpoint.“For J&amp;T to keep growing, maybe the only way is to keep expanding to new countries,” says this source, who asked for anonymity.Timing and the Oppo factorThere are several key elements driving J&amp;T’s rapid expansion.The first one is timing. When J&amp;T was launched in 2015, Indonesia’s ecommerce gross merchandise value (GMV) was at US$1.78 billion, according to research from Google, Temasek, and Bain &amp; Company. But partnering with industry heavyweights such as Shopee and Tokopedia early on arguably gave J&amp;T a solid foundation once the ecommerce pie grew.By 2021, the country’s ecommerce GMV was at US$70 billion – an increase of more than 30x over six years, according to the Google-Temasek-Bain report.The second factor is J&amp;T’s China roots, which can be traced to smartphone maker Oppo. Jet Lee, J&amp;T’s founder and first chief executive, was the Indonesia CEO for Oppo. On the flipside, Oppo founder Tony Chen is a J&amp;T co-founder. This could also explain why the company’s name reportedly stands for “Jet and Tony.”In fact, J&amp;T Express was initially set up as a logistics company to help Oppo’s ecommerce operations in Indonesia. Lee previously said that Indonesian logistics was prone to delays and the quality of services was subpar, which is why he and Chen invested 400 billion rupiah (about US$28 million) into J&amp;T.In turn, the Oppo network has helped J&amp;T expand regionally in Southeast Asia and in China – a “red ocean” market that has healthier unit economics for logistics players compared to Indonesia. In China, J&amp;T operates under the name Jitu and has reached 100% nationwide coverage in just seven months, again by leveraging Oppo’s vast reach.The anonymous co-founder observes that J&amp;T’s strategies in pricing, operations, expansion, and marketing are similar to those used by Oppo and other Chinese smartphone brands. By offering prices lower than its competitors’, J&amp;T gains market share.“That’s what makes J&amp;T brave and quick to grow,” the source says. But since logistics is “ultimately a different game,” he has doubts about the long-term sustainability of J&amp;T’s approach. While smartphone firms “can always grow by releasing new phones with new technologies, it’s not as easy for logistics players,” he adds.Indeed, that strategy is apparent in the company’s entry into China. Six players control 82% of the country’s express market share, and ecommerce giants like Alibaba and JD.com already have established logistics strategies.As a relative latecomer, J&amp;T Express had to be bold in order to make an impact. That’s why it acquired Best Express, an Alibaba logistics partner, at the end of 2021, thus securing a part of the Chinese titan’s shipping volume.J&amp;T also used aggressive subsidies, making its shipping rates cheaper than what rivals such as YTO and STO charge. This triggered a frenzied price war that got the attention of China’s regulators. The local postal administration at Yiwu International Trade City – the country’s biggest wholesale market – issued a warning letter to J&amp;T in April 2021, ordering the company to “rectify” its competitive strategy.Competitors are feeling the regulatory heat as well. The earnings per order of Tongda – the nickname for China’s five biggest ecommerce logistics companies, which are all backed by Alibaba – dropped by 20% to 30% after J&amp;T came in, according to the Momentum Works report.J&amp;T Express’ warehouse / Photo credit: J&amp;T ExpressStill, J&amp;T’s strategy appears to be working. As of January 2021, it has achieved a package delivery volume of over 20 million packages per day, gaining 10% of China’s logistics market share. The company has grown beyond the Oppo network primarily because of Pinduoduo, which is reportedly responsible for about 80% of J&amp;T’s shipments.“J&amp;T Express has partnered with more than 30 ecommerce and short-video platforms to achieve full coverage of China’s major ecommerce platforms,” CEO Robin Lo tells Tech in Asia.Indeed, China is instrumental to J&amp;T’s global success since what happens in this market would affect the company’s strategy, plans, or valuation, wrote Momentum Works in its report.An uphill battleChina aside, J&amp;T is already looking at new frontiers in the Middle East (United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia) and Latin America (starting with Brazil and Mexico).The Middle East market has “great potential due to its strong consumption capacity and potential for ecommerce development in the region,” J&amp;T’s Lo says.For example, Saudi Arabia’s ecommerce market soared by almost 60% from 2019 to 2020, and it’s now expected to be worth 50 billion riyal (US$13 billion) by 2025, according to a new analysis from Boston Consulting Group.Recently, J&amp;T announced a US$2 billion investment to set up its Middle East and North Africa (MENA) headquarters in Riyadh. Together with eWTP Arabia Capital and other partners, the firm is looking to build a smart logistics network in the region.Image credit: Timmy LoenBut some in the industry question why J&amp;T has chosen to venture into this market.“I don’t think there is much logic to the expansion, other than just to build up the narrative that J&amp;T is a global company,” says a logistics executive who has worked in both ecommerce and third-party logistics.Indeed, the size of the Middle East market pales in comparison to Latin America’s. Brazil’s ecommerce market alone, for instance, was forecasted to hit US$27.5 billion in 2021.Perhaps more importantly, going into Latin America also mirrors the strategy of a Southeast Asian ecommerce giant: Shopee.Shopee also entered Latin America by focusing on the region’s two biggest markets: Brazil and Mexico. There are enough similarities between the two countries to make implementation relatively straightforward, but based on Tech in Asia’s analysis, Brazil could even become the biggest market for the platform, beating Indonesia.Latin Americans also have a higher gross domestic product (GDP) per capita than Southeast Asians do, which means higher purchasing power. And in Brazil at least, the logistics infrastructure still has some ways to go – an area where J&amp;T can apply lessons it learned from countries like Indonesia.Image credit: Timmy LoenIt’s unclear if J&amp;T and Shopee are planning to team up in Latin America, and spokespersons for both companies declined to comment on the matter. As previously reported, Shopee aims to have one main logistics partner per market. The unnamed logistics co-founder that Tech in Asia spoke to thinks that it’s “very likely” that J&amp;T and Shopee will merge in the future.However, that doesn’t mean a Middle East expansion is a bad idea. The logistics executive says that perhaps it is “time for J&amp;T to venture to other markets without Shopee.” Oppo’s market share in the Middle East is small but growing, and maybe J&amp;T is trying to jump in at the right time – just like it did in Indonesia.It may also not matter so much as long as J&amp;T keeps a strong position in China.“This is where bulk of the ecommerce goods in various categories are manufactured,” says Vion Yau, head of insights at Momentum Works. “Cross-border ecommerce from China [also] offers huge volumes.”J&amp;T Express in Saudi Arabia / Photo credit: J&amp;T ExpressJ&amp;T is developing its cross-border capabilities through a freight forwarding service, and it has already captured a “significant” volume, according to Yau. The company also sends seller packages to Amazon FBA warehouses in 23 regions, and the service could come in handy should J&amp;T work with China-based global ecommerce platforms like Shein.But ultimately, sources say that there isn’t much that differentiates J&amp;T from other players. The logistics executive who talked to Tech in Asia points out that while there may be operational differences, it’s generally “simple” and easy for competitors to emulate.Similarly, the anonymous logistics co-founder thinks that other Indonesian players can also expand globally – as long as they get the right backing. Perhaps global expansion is the only way to grow their numbers, particularly for J&amp;T. Nevertheless, a big question awaits players who take this route: Is it sustainable?",J&T Express made waves by capitalizing on its ties to Oppo and Shopee. But will that be enough to drive global expansion?,558171,Jofie Yordan,True,Putra Muskita and Eileen C.

While it might be so among individuals, it’s different for corporations. Collaboration among companies requires diligent implementation and coordination on a lot of moving parts to be successful.Synergies do not magically appear when the ink on the deal sheet has dried. From tweaking internal business processes to altering in-house technological infrastructure, Bukalapak has to do it all before enjoying the benefits of its Allo Bank deal.Turning tides: Bukalapak’s investment in Allo Bank challenges the argument that conglomerates like Allo Bank parent CT Corp are only interested in dominating industries, says Bukalapak president Teddy Oetomo. “The attraction is that we have created such a broad, multi-ecosystem partnership, which has the potential to be big,” he tells Tech in Asia.Wise heads: Since the purchase, the value of Bukalapak’s stake in Allo Bank has shot up, peaking at over US$1 billion last month, when the price of Allo Bank’s shares crossed 7,000 rupiah (48 US cents) apiece. “We prefer to invest rather than develop our own because a digital bank is like a combination of a bank and a tech company – it is not easy,” says Oetomo. “We are not bankers.”A treasure chest: Bukalapak has large enough cash reserves – its IPO proceeds stood at US$1.4 billion as of December 2021. The ecommerce giant also holds a credit facility worth US$139 million through Singapore’s DBS Bank. “The credit facility is for bridging purposes only,” Oetomo says. He mentions that the proceeds from Bukalapak’s IPO will not be used up even in the next three to five years.Read more: Behind Bukalapak’s entry into Indonesia’s digital banking raceStartup spotlightUp in the airPhoto credit: AirmeetAirmeet, an event-led engagement platform, has raised US$35 million in a series B funding round that was joined by Prosus Ventures, Sistema Asia Fund, and Sequoia Capital India.Airmeet helps businesses, associations, educational institutions, SMEs, communities, and government organizations establish touchpoints with their global audiences through immersive event experiences.

Headline Asia and NBC Angel Fund also participated in the round, as well as Taihei Kobayashi, CEO of listed creative studio firm Sun Inc.The new round brings Best Beer Japan’s total funding to over US$1 million.Best Beer Japan CEO Peter Rothenberg holds one of the company’s sharing kegs or “rentaru” / Photo credit: Best Beer JapanFounded in 2017 by former Tech in Asia Japan correspondent Peter Rothenberg, Best Beer Japan offers a management software platform for breweries. It has also created Japan’s first keg sharing service, which the company says reduces carbon emissions and cuts the logistics costs of beer transportation by half.The company says that as breweries in the country sell to restaurants directly, they lack a consolidated distribution system. This creates an inefficient process for both breweries and restaurants. Best Beer Japan has started pre-registration for its B2B craft beer platform to make it easier for restaurants to find and pay for beer.“This is a legacy industry. Until now breweries did not have any real IT tools to help with operations. But with the pandemic, adoption of new technologies has been rapid,” explains Rothenberg, who also serves as the company’s CEO.According to him, breweries manage their back office mainly with paper and Microsoft Excel, which takes up to 14 minutes to process one order. There are also strict hygiene and alcohol tax laws that require a large amount of forms to be filled out.“I don’t think anyone became a brewer to do alcohol tax. Our mission is to help breweries focus on making beer, not pushing papers,” the CEO adds.Best Beer Japan will use the fresh funds to hire engineers, sales, and customer success members. “We are still a young company. If you join now you can get paid in cash, stock, and beer,” quips Rothenberg.The startup also plans to invest in creating a B2B beer marketplace, bringing breweries to a single portal that restaurants can order from.See also: Singapore company turns bread to beer to cut Southeast Asia’s food wasteThe company is looking to tap into the craft beer market, which is growing over 10% per year in Japan. The market is set to reach over US$1 billion in 2026 with alcohol tax law changes on the horizon.While the number of breweries in the country has doubled from 250 in 2015 to 500 last year, craft beer accounts for only 1% to 2% of Japan’s beer market.Other investors in the seed round include:Akiyuki Minami, founder and board president of CoconalaOryzarai Inc.Digital Hollywood UniversityAngel investor Chikako MorimotoAngel investor Takeshi SogaTwo unnamed angel investors",Best Beer Japan offers a management software platform for breweries and has created Japan’s first keg sharing service.,449210,Collin Furtado,True,Lorenzo Kyle Subido,0,"['Investments', 'News', 'Startups', 'Transportation']","['beer startup', 'Best Beer Japan', 'breweries', 'craft breweries', 'funding brief', 'Headline Asia', 'IT services', 'Japan', 'logistics', 'NBC Angel Fund', 'PE&HR', 'Sun Inc', 'Taihei Kobayashi']",False,,True,False,True,False,2

Delivered every Wednesday via email and through the Tech in Asia website, this free newsletter breaks down the biggest stories and trends in fintech.

While a lucky few will get their dream jobs, most will settle for another position, as they don’t have the luxury of time and unlimited finances.But the truly determined will find ways to get the job of their dreams – even if that means taking a detour.Crypto providers hoping to obtain a license in Singapore will have to continue waiting it out as the country’s central bank offers the coveted digital payments services license to a select few. After all, the Monetary Authority of Singapore is one of the toughest regulators in the world.Since it opened license applications in early 2020, the city-state has attracted notable names such as Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume.Many who have been rejected or asked to withdraw their applications are now seeking new homes. Binance had seemingly led the charge when it opted for Dubai: With its free zones and generous tax incentives, the Emirati city is fast becoming an alternative destination for crypto firms.In this week’s Big Story, we spoke to crypto players in Singapore and Dubai about what drew them to their home markets. Conversations with both successful and unsuccessful permit applicants in Singapore also shed light on a process that many have called opaque.As one crypto observer put it, it’s premature to assume that Singapore has seen the last of Binance. “I’m 100% sure they’ll come back when it’s the right time.”— MelissaTHE BIG STORYIs Dubai stealing Singapore’s thunder in crypto?Image credit: Timmy LoenBinance led the charge when it withdrew its application in the city-state in favor of Dubai. It appears that many are following suit.THE HOT TAKEIndia warms up to cryptoHere’s what happened:India will launch its own digital rupee, a sovereign-backed facility that is likely to debut by early 2023.Unlike private digital tokens, the digital rupee blockchain gives the government the ability to track transactions.The country also plans to impose a 30% tax on ‌income from the transfer of virtual assets.Here’s our take:After swinging back and forth on its crypto stance, which has ranged from promoting crypto to banning them, India moved a step closer toward adopting and legitimizing digital assets last week.Citizens can potentially use the digital rupee in their e-wallets to pay for goods and services. A key difference is that the funds would be “from the central bank” and “fully backed by the sovereign,” a top government source told The Economic Times.The digital rupee will build upon existing consumer habits around e-wallets and digital payments. In India, 3 billion transactions already take place over United Payments Interface – the digital payment system developed by India’s largest banks – each month.The move comes as crypto trading and ownership soared in India in the past year. Estimates put the number of crypto investors in the country at 15 million to 20 million, who roughly hold US$6 billion in crypto assets.According to blockchain data platform Chainalysis, India ranks second among countries with the highest crypto adoption in the world, trailing only Vietnam. We explored Vietnam’s crypto boom in this earlier story.Several reasons have fueled the rise of crypto trading in India. Investing in equities can take up to three to four days due to documentation, but investing in crypto takes less than an hour, a Chainalysis report noted.Many freelancers and those doing tech-related work for employers abroad are also asking to be paid in cryptocurrency out of convenience and interest in owning digital tokens.While retail demand in the country is strong, a large proportion of crypto activity (42%) are being driven by institutional-sized transfers of above US$10 million.What is India hoping to achieve with the digital rupee?The new Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is expected to give a big boost to India’s digital economy, spurring higher levels of digital transactions since all citizens – even those without bank accounts – can access retail CBDCs in theory.Also, CBDCs could lead to efficiency gains and a “cheaper currency management system,” India’s Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in a recent budget speech.Nirmala Sitharaman, India’s Minister of Finance and Corporate AffairsIf the government can successfully design a CBDC that becomes the de facto currency, it could reduce illicit transactions and money laundering that occur on private digital assets – which it lacks oversight of – and on fiat currency transactions that take place on privately run e-wallets.But while a CBDC gives the central bank the ability to track transactions, some argue that the fintech firms operating e-wallets may lose visibility on customers and their transacting behavior. This might impact their ability to evaluate their clients and extend them loans.India is also hoping to deter speculative trading by introducing a 30% tax rate on incomes from the transfer of digital assets. However, the high tax rates might simply push investors to migrate to service providers in other countries offering more competitive rates instead.The UK’s tax regulator has similarly said that staked digital tokens that are used as collateral or lent out will be subject to a capital gains tax. However, some industry watchers have pointed out that these new rules could result in investors tracking and reporting “hundreds to thousands” of transactions to stay compliant, which could be unfeasible in practice.– MelissaNEWS YOU SHOULD KNOWCheck out Tech in Asia’s coverage of the fintech scene here.1️⃣ Vietnamese investment app snags US$6m from Sequoia India’s Surge, Y Combinator: Launched in January 2021, Infina lets users invest in a range of asset classes such as stocks and fixed-income products with just US$22.2️⃣ Ex-Lazada, Snapp execs’ restaurant payments firm raises $17m in seed money: United Arab Emirates-based Qlub, which enables customers to pay for their orders via a QR code, is expected to launch in overseas markets in the coming weeks.3️⃣ Tiger Global leads $15m round of ex-Lazada exec’s fintech firm: API platform Ayoconnect will use the new capital to launch new products, including a direct debit service and a cards-as-a-service offering.

And when the man on the street takes notice, so will the regulators.Photo credit: UnsplashWhile 2021 may go down as the year that crypto adoption took off and became mainstream, it was also a trying year for crypto companies in Singapore looking to gain legitimacy from one of the world’s toughest regulators.In January, Singapore’s central bank warned crypto providers against marketing their services in public areas. These include using online or print advertisements, as well as hiring social media influencers to promote their services.Amid that backdrop, financial hubs in the Middle East are gaining popularity as alternative crypto-friendly jurisdictions for firms seeking homes. Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, led the charge when it withdrew its application for a license in Singapore in favor of Dubai.It appears that many are following suit, or considering a similar move. “The trend is obvious. Businesses are moving away,” Anndy Lian, chairman of Netherlands-headquartered BigOne Exchange, tells Tech in Asia. With the exchange’s core market in Latin America, Lian says his company has no plans to apply for a license in Singapore. He adds that most crypto firms moving out of the city-state are eyeing markets like Dubai and Europe for their new homes.Singapore is openly welcoming everybody, then openly rejecting almost everybody. Binance itself has run afoul of regulators in several markets, including the UK and Japan. But Lian says that the firm had served as a litmus test for crypto firms looking to set up a base in Singapore. And as far as many were concerned, that test had gone south.Binance declined to comment on this story.A long queueAt the time of writing, just three out of around 170 firms who applied for a digital payment token (DPT) service license in Singapore have obtained one.Over a hundred have withdrawn their applications or been rejected, while at least one has received a license in-principle. According to the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), applicants who receive “in-principle approvals” are still required to “put in place necessary measures and fulfill certain administrative matters” before a license is officially granted.The astonishing odds stacked against crypto hopefuls have led some to voice their frustrations that the city-state isn’t as welcoming as it seems.“Singapore is openly welcoming everybody, then openly rejecting almost everybody,” Lian observes. “It makes people think, ‘is Singapore not a place that I can set up? Is Singapore not a place for me to house myself?’”While smaller crypto projects and decentralized autonomous organizations from Vietnam and Thailand still find Singapore an attractive location, more than half of the “large exchanges” operating in Singapore no longer think that the city-state is a viable location for their Asia headquarters, Lian estimates. He didn’t name specific firms.“It’s a bit seasonal,” remarks a source whose firm was asked by the MAS to withdraw its application, referring to Singapore’s increasingly tough stance on the crypto sector. The source requested anonymity for fear of retribution.Photo credit: Monetary Authority of SingaporeThe source tells Tech in Asia that the firm wasn’t told specifically in which areas it fell short. When asked, case officers said it had “considered all parts of the application” and that it considered the “total readiness” of the company in its review.However, he admitted that the firm “did not do well” on demonstrating its understanding of a travel rule, which requires crypto service providers to be able to identify the sources and destinations of their funds.A waiting gameIn a parliamentary sitting held in July 2021, Senior Minister and Minister in charge of MAS Tharman Shanmugaratnam said that the regulator would reject applicants that “fail to meet the required standards for money laundering and financing of terrorism and technology risks set out in MAS’ regulations and notices.”When the city-state opened the floodgates in 2020, it was met with an overwhelming response from applicants. This led to a lengthy application process, which came at a cost for some crypto license-hopefuls.“For one year, we didn’t dare to do any major promotions about our business or scale up the business,” the source says, as their firm waited to be contacted by a case officer. That’s despite having spent “at least US$500,000” into building its product, as well as for paying the operational costs that the firm continued to incur during that time.But Independent Reserve – one of the three DPT license holders in Singapore – tells Tech in Asia that it found the entire application process to be “pleasant” and “not opaque at all.” The Bitcoin and crypto exchange is the Singapore entity of Australia-headquartered Independent Reserve.Drawn to the city-state’s reputation as a “world-renowned regulator,” Independent Reserve applied for a license in early 2020 and was granted one after an 18-month process, says Raks Sondhi, the firm’s managing director in Singapore.“It was very much a dialogue between two organizations. When we got questions which we could answer with a ‘yes’ or a ‘no,’ we did not do that. We provided a lot more information that was not always requested of us to make sure that [the regulator] understood where we were coming from,” he explains.In email responses to Tech in Asia, a spokesperson for the MAS says that the agency engages applicants extensively to understand the risks of each applicant’s business. “Applicants are informed of their application review outcomes, including MAS’ considerations in the event of an unsuccessful license application,” the spokesperson adds.The allure of DubaiFor BigOne Exchange’s Lian, Binance’s departure simply hastened the exits of other crypto companies out of the city-state, which began six months ago.As Singapore turned inward during the pandemic, introducing more stringent requirements for foreign work passes and prioritizing local hires, Dubai welcomed digital nomads with open arms with a one-year virtual working program.Crypto firms incorporating in Dubai have “mushroomed” in the past year, observes Meng Chan Shu, co-founder and CEO of Dubai-based Connect Blockchain, who has lived in the city for over a decade.A view of the DMCC Metro Station from Dubai Marina / Photo credit: DreamstimeA combination of the city’s attractive tax rates, pro-business policies, and crypto-friendly stance have attracted an inflow of crypto firms in recent years.Shu, whose firm offers a crypto-to-crypto exchange as well as proprietary trading services, estimates that “easily more than 100” firms have set up shop in the past couple of months within the Dubai Multi Commodities Center (DMCC) free zone, where Connect Blockchain operates.In a dedicated crypto center within the DMCC, a 0% personal and corporate tax rate, 100% business ownership, and no capital repatriation limits are just a few of the perks offered. This means that expats can fully own their companies and remit all profits back to their home countries. In contrast, it’s common for many countries to impose ownership rules that mandate foreign firms to acquiesce the majority stakes to a local firm.Singapore, too, does not impose foreign ownership requirements on businesses. While the country’s corporate income tax rate is a flat 17%, various incentives and rebates can lower the effective interest rate.The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has roughly 30 free trade zones that offer a wealth of benefits to foreign investors. A majority of these are located in Dubai.The city started welcoming crypto firms and talent from as early as 2016. Two years later, the UAE followed with a blockchain strategy that aimed to bring 50% of government transactions onto a blockchain platform by 2021.Crypto companies and projects always look for alpha and adoption. That’s more important.Like many, Shu was part of a rush of firms in Dubai looking to cash in on the Middle East’s booming crypto sector.Dubai’s strategic location and a time zone that straddles Asian, European, and US business and trading hours makes it highly connected and attractive to firms targeting a global audience. “If I want to go anywhere in Europe or in Asia, it’s seven hours away,” Shu adds.In contrast, Singapore’s proximity to Asia isn’t as attractive to some crypto firms given the 24/7 and borderless nature of the industry.That said, Singapore boasts a relatively high level of awareness around crypto. Its proximity to the large unbanked and underbanked markets of Southeast Asia also matters.Vietnam, a largely cash-based society, is ranked the world’s highest in crypto adoption according to Chainalysis. Nearly 6 million people – or 6% of the population – own the digital asset, which play-to-earn games have widely popularized in the past year.See also: Explaining Vietnam’s crypto boom“In jurisdictions where a large majority of the population are unbanked or underbanked, the demand for crypto, more specifically decentralized finance, can come in to bring about greater financial inclusion,” says Edward Chen, CEO of crypto exchange Huobi Singapore.No mass exodusCrypto executives based in both financial centers, however, don’t think the industry’s firms are leaving Singapore in droves.“A lot of firms are still migrating toward Singapore and basing themselves in Singapore. Firms will expand to jurisdictions that allow crypto businesses to operate,” Independent Reserve’s Sondhi says.He adds that organizations tend to “stay where they can stay until the legislation or regulatory framework changes or evolves, and they make a decision whether to remain there or to move elsewhere.”The firm sees Singapore’s strict approach as being “appropriate to filter the serious players in the market,” despite being impacted by the MAS’ most recent guidelines.“We understand and appreciate that the emphasis has always been on protecting consumers and ensuring the safety of their assets and data,” Sondhi adds. “With consultations and working with the companies in Singapore who are applying for licenses and who have received these licenses, I think we’ll be able to work through this.”Still, there should be some caution when pitting Singapore against Dubai.“It’s not an apple-to-apple comparison. Crypto companies and projects always look for alpha and adoption. That’s more important,” Shu of Connect Blockchain says.It’s likely that Singapore’s reputation as a digital financial hub will see it continually draw in crypto firms, as many seek to gain credibility and legitimacy in the public sphere.We don’t need 160 of them to set up shop here. Half of them can do so, but with very high standards, that I think is a better outcome.“​​Both Singapore and Dubai are known for their open economy, trade openness, and stable environments. Both countries are also well-established financial hubs with a track record for progressive policies and innovation in Asia Pacific and the Middle East, respectively, making them well-placed to be the crypto hubs in the region,” Huobi’s Chen says.The firm is currently operating with an exemption from holding a license in Singapore, while it awaits the results of its application.“We don’t need 160 of them to set up shop here. Half of them can do so, but with very high standards, that I think is a better outcome,” Ravi Menon, managing director of the MAS, said in a Bloomberg interview last November.Despite its unsuccessful attempt, the anonymous source says that their firm plans to re-apply for a permit in Singapore in the future, when sentiments around crypto are more positive and when there’s greater regulatory clarity.The firm is open to applying in other Southeast Asian markets where there’s a successful rollout of a license regime, though it’s ruling out markets like Dubai, which it deems “unfamiliar.”“When one country shuts and another door opens, we’ll go there,” the source adds.",Binance led the charge when it withdrew its application in the city-state in favor of Dubai.

731634,2022-02-08T09:25:23,2022-02-08T09:25:23,This fintech firm’s fight with its founder may end in a courtroom,bharatpe-board-headed-legal-battle,post,"BharatPe, a fintech unicorn backed by Tiger Global and Sequoia India, has been in the news lately for all the wrong reasons.After a string of alleged boardroom tussles, claims of fraud, and badmouthing, it would be no surprise if the company’s board is headed towards a legal battle with one of its founders, Ashneer Grover.Grover, who is on leave for two months, last week sent a letter to the board that sought the removal of the company’s CEO, Suhail Sameer, calling him an “investors’ puppet”. However, Shashvat Nakrani, BharatPe’s other founder, has backed Sameer.This has created a deadlock between Grover and Nakrani. According to legal experts, company founders jointly have the right to appoint a CEO, and the CEO can be removed if all the founders decide to withdraw the person’s nomination from the board.Grover is also seeking a whopping US$535 million payout to quit the company. According to an Economic Times report, the board is unlikely to accept Grover’s demand.“In light of these situations, there is a high likelihood that this may lead to court litigation if the deadlock is not resolved,” Salman Waris, managing partner at TechLegis Advocates &amp; Solicitors, an India-based law firm, told Tech in Asia.Grover has already assembled a legal teamto protect himself against a possible ouster from BharatPe. He has also begun talks to sell nearly 10% stake in the company.“This is an indication of a cultural difference between how investors want things done and how the founder thought he could run the show,” notes a legal expert who did not want to be named.An email that Tech in Asia sent to BharatPe did not elicit a response while calls made to Grover went unanswered.Grover’s tumble from the topAmid these controversies and questions about its corporate governance, BharatPe underwent an independent audit of its internal processes and systems.The audit’s findings, which were leaked on Twitter, cast a shadow over Grover and his wife Madhuri Grover as they were linked to “fraudulent schemes,” according to a Livemint report.The preliminary probe by auditing firm Alvarez and Marsal pointed to recruitment fraud and payment to non-existent members. But BharatPe stated that its board has yet to receive an interim or final report of the review.See also:A Singapore startup said no to an investor. The investor sued, citing a breach of contractGrover’s problems started in early January, when an audio clip allegedly featuring the founder himself surfaced. In the clip, a person could be heard hurling abuse and death threats at a Kotak Mahindra Bank manager for failing to deliver shares of FSN E-commerce Ventures – the parent firm of cosmetics retailer Nykaa – to the founder and his wife during the company’s IPO in November 2021.Grover responded by calling the audio clip a fake on Twitter, but he later deleted the tweet. Meanwhile, Kotak Mahindra Bank said that it was planning to take legal action against Grover and his wife, who is also BharatPe’s head of controls.On January 19, BharatPe announced that Grover had taken a “voluntary leave of absence” until the end of March.","After alleged boardroom battles and claims of fraud, BharatPe’s board and its co-founder Ashneer Grover could be embroiled in a legal tussle.",589814,Samreen Ahmad,True,Collin Furtado and Eileen C.

For the past two years, investments in crypto and blockchain companies have outpaced the funding received by payments firms.Singapore saw record levels of investment in crypto and blockchain, with nearly US$1.5 billion transacted across 82 deals in 2021 as compared to US$109.7 million over 26 deals in the previous year. The report noted that majority of the crypto and blockchain deals in the city-state last year went toward software and underlying infrastructure rather than services.“Cryptocurrencies and blockchain are expected to remain very hot areas of investment in 2022, with more crypto firms looking to regulators to provide clear guidance on activities in order to help foster and develop the space,” said Anton Ruddenklau, global fintech leader at KPMG International.While funding in the payments space fell behind crypto and blockchain investments, there was a 10x increase in the value of payments-related deals locally. Total funding in the space grew from US$60 million in 2020 to US$628.4 million in 2021.A continued interest in areas like buy now, pay later, embedded banking, and open banking-aligned solutions have helped keep the payments space robust, noted the report.See also: Series SEA: Who’s investing in the region’s fintech startups?Global fintech funding topped US$210 billion across a record 5,684 deals in 2021.

731564,2022-02-08T05:00:34,2022-02-08T04:54:57,Behind Bukalapak’s entry into Indonesia’s digital banking race,bukalapaks-entry-indonesias-digital-banking-race,post,"Bukalapak, an Indonesian ecommerce giant, kicked off 2022 by spending US$83 million to acquire 12.05% of Allo Bank, a Jakarta-based digital bank owned by Chairul Tanjung, an entrepreneur and former politician.This was not Bukalapak’s first venture into the banking industry – in mid-2021, the online marketplace made a deal to integrate Standard Chartered’s banking-as-a-service solution into its platform.However, for the recently listed firm, buying a stake in Allo Bank is a significant move within Indonesia’s fast-growing digital banking space. Notably, Bukalapak’s co-investors in the digital bank include conglomerate Salim Group, super app Grab, and automotive marketplace Carro.Bukalapak’s office / Photo credit: BukalapakIndeed, Emtek – one of Bukalapak’s major shareholders – already has plans to turn the Bandung-based Bank Fama into a digital bank, with help from Grab and Singaporean telco Singtel. The media conglomerate holds a majority stake in Bank Fama.Bukalapak’s investment in Allo Bank goes against the argument that conglomerates like Allo Bank parent CT Corp are only interested in dominating industries, says Bukalapak president Teddy Oetomo. In fact, such companies are now used to collaborations with multiple parties, including tech players like Bukalapak, he adds.“The attraction is that we have created such a broad, multi-ecosystem partnership, which has the potential to be big,” Oetomo tells Tech in Asia.Allo Bank’s appealThe acquisition of Allo Bank allows Bukalapak to dive into retail – a growing trend among ecommerce companies. Not long after the deal, Bukalapak announced an e-grocery joint venture with Trans Retail, another unit of Tanjung’s CT Corp. Trans Retail operates the Transmart supermarket chain and previously managed the Indonesian outlets of France’s Carrefour.Allo Bank illustration / Photo credit: Allo BankBukalapak’s move followed those of a few other internet firms: GoTo snapped up over 6.74% of Matahari Putra Prima, while Blibli planned to acquire a majority stake in Ranch Market operator Boga Supra Lestari.Bukalapak was also drawn to Allo Bank because of the latter’s valuation prospects. According to Oetomo, the bank’s price-to-book ratio was 1.7 when the acquisition took place, which was more attractive than that of other licensed digital banks.Since the purchase, the value of Bukalapak’s shares in Allo Bank has also shot up. Bukalapak had bought the shares at an exercise price of 478 rupiah (3.3 US cents) per share. That number peaked at over 7,000 rupiah (48 US cents) in January 2022, boosting the value of Bukalapak’s assets in Allo Bank to over US$1 billion – a growth of more than 12x from its initial US$83 million investment.“We prefer to invest rather than develop our own because a digital bank is like a combination of a bank and a tech company – it is not easy,” says Oetomo. “We are not bankers.”Of course, one obvious question is how a digital bank will affect Bukalapak’s bottom line.In the first three quarters of 2021, the company clocked net revenue of US$94 million, of which US$54 million was marketplace revenue, US$35 million came from Mitra Bukalapak, and US$5 million from its B2B arm, BukaPengadaan.Investing in Allo Bank ties in well with the tech firm’s larger strategy for Mitra Bukalapak. It could allow warungs or roadside stalls served by the company’s online-to-offline offering to improve their trading capacity, Oetomo adds. The bank will also offer various financial services to Bukalapak’s consumers and help achieve more sustainable business growth.The deal opens the door for various commercial agreements, ranging from revenue sharing to capital appreciation, Oetomo says, adding that such deals will boost Bukalapak’s bottom line. “We’re confident that it will positively contribute to our paid gross transaction values.”Ultimately, these banking services could benefit all of Bukalapak’s stakeholders, which include its 6.7 million merchant partners on its marketplace, 10.4 million Mitra Bukalapak partners, and 100 million end consumers.Aldi Adrian Hartanto, vice president of investments at MDI Ventures, agrees that Bukalapak will benefit greatly from its tie-up with Allo Bank because the ecommerce firm can create synergies with both CT Corp and the Salim Group amid its efforts to expand in retail.“The impact on Bukalapak doesn’t seem to be direct. It’s more about synergies to leverage multiple other relationships, especially for the sake of Mitra Bukalapak transactions,” he says.Mitra Bukalapak partners, for instance, can process all their transactions for fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), non-FMCG, and virtual products through the Allo Bank connected to the Mitra Bukalapak app. End consumers can also pay their bills via the Bukalapak marketplace.Co-founder and ex-CEO Achmad Zaky (left) with a Bukalapak partner / Photo credit: BukalapakHartanto adds that integrating these apps can in turn provide convenience for Bukalapak users. It would increase user stickiness and contribute to Bukalapak’s revenue through transaction fees.At the same time, digital banks also need a broad ecosystem to acquire users. The size of the ecosystem determines the benefits to users, which is crucial to earning loyalty.Playing the long gamePart of the reason digital banks are attractive is their potential for profits. For example, foreign players like KakaoBank or WeBank each reported over US$100 million in net profit by 2020, as did Gojek-backed Bank Jago.At the same time, profitability can’t come instantly. KakaoBank, for instance, turned a profit in 2019 – about two years after it began operations.That said, the losses may not necessarily impact Bukalapak’s finances directly, according to Paulus Jimmy, an equity research analyst at Sucor Sekuritas. He says that when it comes to sentiment in the public market, Bukalapak has bigger fish to fry than its digital banking strategies.Bukalapak’s shares did rise to 500 rupiah (3.4 US cents) per share on January 3, thanks to its investment in Allo Bank. However, they dropped to 338 rupiah (2.3 US cents) per share by January 25, far from the IPO price of 850 rupiah (5.9 US cents).“Investors think that the overall perception of the tech sector is still poor. Many expect that with the recovery that will occur this year, the old economy will grow and become attractive again,” says Paulus.Because Allo Bank’s business development strategy is still unclear, Bukalapak will not benefit in the short term, he adds. It’s a similar scenario for Bukalapak’s joint venture with CT Corp.“The joint venture is in e-grocery, emerging industry with great potential, especially during a pandemic. But on the other hand, the challenges are also big, especially in terms of logistics and the waste generated,” he says.See also: Indonesia e-grocery battle escalates as more players enter the frayNevertheless, Bukalapak still has large enough cash reserves – its IPO proceeds stood at US$1.4 billion as of December 2021. Also, the company holds a credit facility worth US$139 million through Singapore’s DBS Bank.“The credit facility is for bridging purposes only,” Oetomo says. “With the Allo Bank investment numbering below [US$83 million], there is still a buffer.” He mentions that the proceeds from Bukalapak’s IPO will not be used up even in the next three to five years.Paulus adds that Bukalapak has received approval for the change in the use of its IPO funds: it is allocating 33% of proceeds for working capital – half the initial amount – in order to make room for corporate actions. For investors, this serves as a clear enough sign of the company’s growth strategies going forward.Currency converted from Indonesian rupiah to US dollar: US$1 = 14,396 rupiahA version of this article was originally published by Deandra Syarizka on Tech in Asia Indonesia.","Allo Bank, which Bukalapak acquired in January 2022, is backed by a conglomerate with a strong retail presence.",559337,Budi Sutrisno,True,Putra Muskita and Arpit Nayak,0,"['Acquisitions', 'Ecommerce', 'Premium Content']","['Acquisition', 'Allo Bank', 'Bukalapak', 'ct corp', 'digital bank', 'Indonesia', 'indonesian ecommerce']",False,,True,True,True,False,6

731409,2022-02-07T05:38:03,2022-02-09T03:44:35,Aerodyne: Can it remain Malaysia’s drone jewel?,aerodyne-remain-malaysia-drone-jewel,post,"Since Grab moved its headquarters to Singapore, Malaysia has been on a quest to churn out its next unicorn. The country has set a target to raise five companies with valuations north of US$1 billion by 2025.One name that’s on the lips of ecosystem stakeholders – including policymakers – is Aerodyne.Photo credit: AerodyneThe drone specialist has made headlines for being a Malaysian champion that has a presence abroad, defying the “jaguh kampung” label, a jibe in the Malay language aimed at local firms that can’t compete overseas despite enjoying privileges at home.Aerodyne is the no. 1 drone service provider in the world, according to market research firm Drone Industry Insights (DII).Since it was launched, the firm has closed a few funding rounds, drawing in a multinational roster of institutional investors. Even VentureTech, a unit under the Malaysian Industry-Government Group for High Technology,jumped on the bandwagon and provided a 20 million ringgit (US$4.8 million) investment for the company to expand its drone business.More importantly, the firm’s meteoric rise has influenced policymakers to improve regulations, such as launching a sandbox program for drone tech hopefuls, which in turn has spurred the growth of the local drone industry.DII estimates that by 2025, the drone tech sector will register US$127 billion worldwide and US$300 million in Malaysia specifically.And it’s easy to understand this hype: Commercial drone services can be used in a wide range of areas – from asset inspection, agriculture, logistics, to security and surveillance.Besides having ample land, Malaysia is home to a few drone test sites, and many of its key sectors – such as infrastructure and oil palm – have begun to rely on drone technology, primarily due to Covid-19 restrictions that have caused an acute labor shortage.But amid these tailwinds, can Aerodyne continue to be the darling of the drone tech scene?Aerodyne group CEO Kamarul A. Muhamed / Photo credit: EYAerodyne group CEO Kamarul A. Muhamed tells Tech in Asia in an email interview that in the beginning, building the company with a “limited budget and local resources” was a major challenge.But Aerodyne, he says, is an outlier because it’s constantly pivoting to “solve real-world challenges.”Growth enginesAlthough it was founded in 2014, Aerodyne’s roots go back eight years before its inception, when it was a division in a media production company that Kamarul founded.While the unit was intended to capture visuals using drones, Kamarul saw a bigger opportunity: offering drone services to take on high-risk jobs – drones could carry out these tasks at about two-thirds the cost.When Aerodyne was incorporated, it began working on solutions for asset inspection. Its first customer was national oil company Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas), who tasked the firm to monitor and track the progress of the US$27 billion Pengerang Integrated Complex in Johor.Aerodyne then ventured into data analytics, allowing companies to apply their findings to manage assets better while also lowering maintenance costs.The firm is now billing itself as a DT3 company, offering drone tech, data tech, and digital transformation.But besides drone-based asset management, Kamarul says Aerodyne has four growth engines: Agrimor (precision agriculture), Fulcrum (surveillance and security), Dronos (data tech), and Argentavis (logistics).This entire process was the right recipe for Aerodyne, says a Kuala Lumpur-based investment banker.“It was lucky, it entered the market at the right time with its novel solutions, raked in money as its initial business verticals were profitable, and has maintained that growth thanks to a somewhat encouraging ecosystem,” he says.But Aerodyne’s growth hasn’t been smooth. The company, Kamarul says, has gone through nine different crises that include Covid-19.He says Agrimor and Fulcrum are two examples of how the company devised solutions amid pandemic-induced restrictions to turn its fortunes around.For instance, Agrimor was introduced when many foreign workers were sent back to their home countries when Malaysia was in lockdown.Agrimor helps farmers increase crop yield while lowering operating costs by precisely seeding, fertilizing, watering, and even spraying crops.Meanwhile, Fulcrum, the company’s AI-driven surveillance and security drone solutions, came about following the Malaysian police force’s request for assistance in ensuring compliance during lockdown.“Since our work was also impacted due to the lockdown, we had to rethink how to purpose our 50 pilots,” Kamarul said. Fulcrum’s swarm drones were deployed to make “compliance monitoring safer, faster, as well as more efficient,” says the CEO.Despite these advances, Aerodyne is setting its sights further.“We are developing a super app for agriculture that we can deploy globally, and the solution will be ready for export by this year,” Kamarul shares.Competition heats upAerodyne isn’t the only one in the drone industry who’s capitalizing on a crisis. Malaysia-based Poladrone drew in about US$4.3 million in a seed round led by Wavemaker Partners, according to an October 26 TechCrunch report.Poladrone’s niche is in agriculture, and its flagship program, Oracytes, is also a precision agriculture solution targeted at oil palm plantations.But the company is moving further into Aerodyne territory with its plans to tackle jobs in high-risk industries. Poladrone also ventured abroad to Thailand in early 2020.Another Malaysian drone player, Meraque Services, teamed up with pharmaceutical giant Pharmaniaga to launch an initiative that would deliver critical medicine to flood victims.Dubbed Project Eagle, the program deployed four drones over three days to deliver supplies to 30 homes in the Kuala Langat neighborhood in Selangor.More established logistics companies such as Capital A (formerly AirAsia) and DHL Express have also either launched or are testing their own drone solutions in the country.Capital A has launched an academy to train drone pilots, while DHL has worked with local drone tech provider Pen Aviation to test last-mile cargo deliveries.A DHL spokesperson tells Tech in Asia that its proof-of-concept (POC) with Pen Aviation came on the heels of the recent 12th Malaysian Plan, a five-year development program announced by the government last year that highlights the importance of seamless connectivity and reliability in transport and logistics and other focus areas.“The use of drone technology will enable us to reach rural communities especially in East Malaysia, where critical items such as vaccines, medicines, and medical devices are needed,” says the spokesperson.Work on the DHL-Pen Aviation POC is ongoing, with the logistics giant aiming to deploy drones to transfer packages of up to 12 kilograms from cargo ship decks to the ports and vice versa.Navigating regulatory hurdlesRegulations are the bane of drone tech players in Malaysia, as these firms often have to seek approvals from a lot of different agencies.But policymakers have been working to ease red tape over the last three years, Wan Mohd Farhan Wan Mohd Fuaad, a drone industry advocate, tells Tech in Asia.As a result, Malaysian firms have seen tremendous growth, Wan Mohd Farhan argues, citing the likes of Aerodyne, Meraque, Poladrone,and Ofo Tech who have “definitely benefited from market readiness, awareness, and the relatively affordable acquisition cost of technology.”Among the much-talked-about policies that are in place include the National Technology &amp; Innovation Sandbox, which acts as a bridge between regulators and drone tech companies.Wan Mohd Farhan says that regulations are hard to avoid and even necessary.The rise of drone applications in agriculture as well as among hobbyists does pose a national and public security risk since drones can capture and process images.But the numbers in the industry have been encouraging, Wan Mohd Farhan adds. Malaysia’s standards and quality agency, SIRIM, estimates that more than 66,000 registered drones have been imported as of 2021, while drone maker DJI mentioned in a 2020 webinar interview that Malaysia is its biggest market in Southeast Asia.Wan Mohd Farhan also points out that local regulators in the country, led by the Civil Aviation Authority of Malaysia’s (CAAM) drone taskforce, which was set up in early 2020, have made strides in understanding the industry.The Civil Aviation Directive 6011, which spells out the requirements for unmanned aircraft systems in areas such as agriculture, is one example of how government agencies are making clearer regulations. There’s also the remote pilot training organizations program, which local drone training firm Drone Academy and Capital A were recent beneficiaries of.Garuda Robotics testing its “vertical takeoff and landing” drone at an oil palm plantation / Photo credit: Garuda RoboticsCoupled with the availability of land, which means larger test sites for drone companies, these moves have encouraged overseas firms, such as Singapore-based Garuda Robotics, to test their solutions in Malaysia.“The larger the area, the more realistic the environment for companies who are testing new drone technologies and developing drone solutions involving beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) flights,” Garuda managing director Frederick Ooi tells Tech in Asia.Garuda is running trials, as well as providing supporting and consulting services, at the Medini drone test site (DTS) in Johor, Malaysia’s southernmost state.The Medini DTS is said to be the largest test site in Southeast Asia.Still tricky to navigateChallenges still abound for those wanting to make inroads in the drone space. Singapore-based logistics firm Ninja Van put its drone delivery ambitions in Malaysia on the back burner.Meraque CEO Md Razalee Ismail tells Tech in Asia that last-mile drone deliveries for medicine are viable, but scaling it won’t be easy for many reasons.First, demand is an issue. Unless the market for last-mile medicine delivery is primed, it’s going to be hard for industry players to invest in providing these solutions.Second, the government needs to make sure that the ecosystem is ready to support the mass production of drones to be used in last-mile delivery, as “it is very costly just to import a drone, let alone to provide a purpose-built drone for last-mile medicine delivery,” says Razalee. “In this light, there has to be both policies to spur growth of a drone-tech-related supply chain and economic incentives for relevant industry players.”Third, regulations are still not up to snuff. “There has been great support from regulators like CAAM, but there is still infrastructure that needs to be made ready, such as the unmanned traffic management system and a more integrated and streamlined approval process for drone flight operations,” he notes.Currently, it takes time for each flight to be approved due to flight safety operations, “which we fully understand, as drones share the same airspace as civilian and military aircraft,” shares Razalee.Larger corporations, too, face systemic problems when deploying drones to audit and maintain assets.Kuala Lumpur-based telco tower giant Edotco tells Tech in Asia that its “current challenge and limitation” is identifying the assets of operators or tenants on older towers it acquired.IPO on trackAerodyne seems to be unfazed by some of the restrictions that newer entrants are facing.The company’s plan to list in the “next few years” is on track, Kamarul says. “Our potential options right now include the Nasdaq, Tokyo Stock Exchange, and we are also exploring dual-listing on Bursa Malaysia.”DealStreetAsia reported that the drone company has been in the market to raise US$100 million since June last year.Investor heavyweights such as Japan’s Drone Fund, China’s North Summit Capital, and Malaysia’s Axiata Digital Innovation Fund participated in Aerodyne’s previous funding rounds.The drone specialist is also on the hunt for mergers and acquisitions. It recently purchased Malaysia-based AI and analytics firm Synapse Innovation to help with large-scale data projects.The company is guided by two areas in its search for M&amp;As: market expansion and technology development, says Kamarul.In the case of market expansion, Aerodyne’s foray into the Middle East began when it invested in Dubai-based Falcon Eye Drones in 2020. A similar pattern can be found in its investments in US-based Measure and Australia’s Sensorem.Technology development for Aerodyne, on the other hand, involves acquiring companies that tout new tech. The Synapse acquisition is an example of how Aerodyne can upscale its current data analytics and AI technology, Kamarul adds.Room to growAlthough much can be said about the progress in the sector, “we have barely scratched the surface with the commercial drone scene,” a senior tech veteran tells Tech in Asia.“The good part is that those venturing into the drone space now have Aerodyne and others as benchmarks. But [new players] do not need to copy the group’s every move,” she says.“Excluding financial services, Malaysia has about 10 sectors where drones can be deployed, such as logistics and telco infrastructure. All we need is some creative people to do things that others have yet to do.”For Wan Mohd Farhan, the industry advocate we spoke to, he recommends newer entrants to go into the services sector, such as agriculture, to sustain their businesses while developing R&amp;D applications within the industry or elsewhere.Meraque CEO Md Razalee Ismail/ Photo credit: MeraqueExisting players like Meraque are already looking outside Malaysia to stay competitive. It’s “looking at M&amp;As and partnerships with key regional players while increasing our market share in Malaysia,” Razalee says.Edotco, meanwhile, plans to set up its own team of in-house drone pilots, either organically or through an acquisition, the company says.Wan Mohd Farhan also expects Malaysia to develop, test, and implement an unnamed traffic management system within the next 12 months, which he says will enable “beyond visual line of sight” flights.“This will unlock opportunities for applications such as commercial drone delivery” as well as drone pods – essentially docking stations where drones can be controlled remotely – for autonomous asset inspection, monitoring, and security surveillance, he shares.The traffic management system “will also set the basis for future drone sky highways similar to how airlines are currently operating globally,” he adds.Aerodyne will certainly be there to snap up these opportunities. But, this time, other players will also be waiting in the wings.Currency converted from Malaysian ringgit to US dollar: US$1 = 4.19 ringgit.Correction (February 9, 11:29 a.m. SGT): The article has been corrected to reflect Aerodyne’s year of inception as well as VentureTech’s investment in the company.","The Malaysian drone tech specialist is having a growth spurt, even eyeing an IPO.

Get the newsletter in your inbox everyday with a Premium subscription.Hi readers,I recently took up baking to beat the pandemic blues. While it has been relaxing, the most difficult part was gathering the ingredients – it always seemed like I was missing a few.A few weeks ago, I came across an app that promised grocery deliveries within 10 minutes. I hadn’t even decided whether to bake a cake or just some muffins when the doorbell rang, and voila! My ingredients had arrived.The super-quick service was impressive and piqued my interest as a financial journalist to figure out how the model really worked.While experts questioned quick commerce’s economic viability, they all agreed that the service was undeniably attractive to consumers. The experts have tracked the evolution of the model and incorporated bits of it into their own businesses to avoid FOMO.It’s also worth noting that the quick commerce delivery model has not yet found its feet in the US. In contrast, when we crunched the numbers, we found that Zepto, an Indian 10-minute delivery startup that came out of stealth mode in November 2021, is close to breaking even.While the figures are promising, the impact of the model on delivery staff can be alarming in some cases. Apart from a swathe of challenges they face in India, delivery personnel have highlighted complaints from customers for being even two minutes late on an order.This short delivery window also forces drivers to tread India’s pothole-riddled roads at dangerously high speeds.The model is still in its infancy in India, and we’ll have to wait and watch how it can be improved. For now, the big question remains whether these startups can balance convenience, economic viability, and driver safety.— Deepti Sri, journalist at Tech in AsiaTop stories this weekImage credit: Timmy Loen1️.

One of them was the latest season of Demon Slayer, the hit anime series about a young boy and his sister who go around, well, slaying demons in early 20th century Japan.One of the key plot points in the show is the ongoing war between the Demon Slayer Corps (of which our protagonist is a part of) and the demons, led by their leader and the top echelon known as the Twelve Moons. With this season’s antagonist proving the most difficult one yet, it’s making me even more excited imagining what the eventual fight against the top-ranking demon will be like.Today’s premium story, on the other hand, takes all the guesswork out of figuring out who’s at the top of Indonesia’s most funded startups and tech companies. With many strong contenders, any guesses as to which firm it might be?Today we look at:50 startups in Indonesia with the most money in their coffersThe India-based gaming studio that’s the recipient of an investment from PUBG developer KraftonOther newsy highlights such as Endeavor Indonesia’s second cohort for its accelerator program and Canva’s latest acquisition. Premium summaryDiving into IndonesiaImage credit: Timmy LoenIf you’ve been reading Tech In Asia for a while or are familiar with the Asian tech scene, many of the names on today’s listicle will no doubt be recognizable. Indonesia’s tech and startup scene boasts a number of behemoth unicorns and other rising stars, all of which are vying for a slice of the Indonesian market in their respective industries. Let’s dive in to see which of them are holding the biggest bags.The big four: Out of the 50 companies that made our list, only four tech giants have recorded more than US$1 billion in funding, amassing US$8.9 billion in total. By contrast, the next closest competitor to the top four, online investing platform Ajaib, sits at US$243 million in funding.A Kopious amount: Food and beverage might not have the biggest presence in our listicle, but grab-and-go coffee chain Kopi Kenangan is leading the way for its industry with US$205 million in disclosed funding over the last two years. The company raised this amount during its series B and series C rounds with the help of investors such as Kunlun Capital and Sequoia Capital.Switching it up: Amid a deluge of edtech, logistics, and other common sectors, Tani Hub Indonesia stands out as the only agtech firm in our list.

It recently made good on its word by investing US$5.4 million in Nautilus, a mobile game development studio based in the country.The slate thus far: Krafton’s US$5.4 million investment in Nautilus makes it the first time the South Korean firm has pumped funds into an India-based gaming studio. The company has so far invested in gaming platform Nodwin, storytelling startup Pratilipi, audio dating app Frnd, and video game streaming platform Loco.Playing ball: Zooming in on the recipient of these fresh funds reveals a gaming studio that develops and publishes cricket games. Founded in 2013, Nautilus was acquired by JetSynthesys, a digital entertainment and tech company, in October 2020. The Nautilus mobile app has recorded 100 million downloads and 10 million monthly active users so far.Going the distance: With the additional capital in its pockets, Nautilus aims to expand into more markets and improve on its current offerings. In this area, the company plans to develop more games in addition to cricket.

The Singapore-headquartered firm is the only one that sells plant-based ice cream. After its latest funding round, the company will make its vegan ice cream products available in supermarkets by the second quarter of the year.Funding galore: We are all aware of the difficulty of raising venture capital funds for startups. However, companies in the edtech and fintech space are making it look easy, with over 20% of the recently funded Southeast Asian startups coming from these industries.Dominant markets: Startups from Singapore and Indonesia make up more than 70% of the Southeast Asian startups that have recently raised funds.

The fresh funds will be used for R&amp;D, as well as developing fusion reactor heating equipment, heat extraction equipment, and fusion plant engineering.Believers across the board: Several venture firms globally have already been established to help realize the potential of fusion reactors.

Technologies such as artificial intelligence and robotics have paved the way for greater efficiency and connectivity in business processes.For Asia Pacific’s manufacturing industry, these digital transformations could prove to be a particularly huge boost – business and government leaders in the region believe that the manufacturing industry will be one of the biggest beneficiaries of this fourth industrial revolution.Why they believe this is not surprising: There have been rapid advancements in the sector over the years including using the internet to make manufacturing easier and harnessing alternative resources for sustainable production.How can companies experience these benefits and gear themselves up for smart and sustainable manufacturing? This was one of the topics that was explored during the Industrial Transformation Asia-Pacific event organized by trade fair operator Deutsche Messe AG. The Agency for Science, Technology and Research (ASTAR), which is under the Ministry of Trade and Industry of Singapore, took part in the event, which was held on November 22 to 24 last year.Securing supply chainsFor manufacturing companies, supply chain management is set to rapidly advance with the help of industry 4.0, allowing firms to create resilient, responsive, and secure supply chains.These advancements are critical because supply chains become more complex as firms get bigger and scale their output. However, these growing supply chains aren’t usually designed with transparency or resilience in mind, as businesses, which aim to maximize potential earnings, tend to focus more on efficiency, cost, and proximity to markets. This puts companies at risk of experiencing supply chain disruptions every 3.7 years due to shocks such as pandemics or financial crises. These disruptions could last a month or longer, with the most severe ones having a large financial impact.This is where industry 4.0 practices come in. Data connectivity technologies – such as the internet of things – allow companies to link various supply chain stakeholders together and provide visibility throughout the chain. Additionally, firms can utilize a central control tower system – a centralized hub containing end-to-end data in a supply chain – to allow each stakeholder to share their own data.“[This supplies] data in a form that is easily shared and understood by each party, and that creates resilience,” Alfred Huan, assistant chief executive of the Science and Engineering Research Council at ASTAR, explained during the event. Should a disruption occur, having visibility in the supply chain – through solutions like a central control tower – gives companies the ability to quickly identify the problem and rapidly respond to it using the appropriate data.Alfred Huan, assistant chief executive of the Science and Engineering Research Council at ASTAR / Photo credit: ASTARTo help companies adopt these industry 4.0 practices and technologies, ASTAR kicked off its US$13.2 million Supply Chain 4.0 Initiative with its partners the National University of Singapore and the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD).Tay Ming Hui, managing director of enterprise software provider PD Solutions, expressed support for the initiative: “We look forward to co-developing solutions with ASTAR and implementing them for businesses. At the same time, we will enhance our domain expertise in supply chain technologies by taking up ASTAR training courses.”As part of this initiative, ASTAR also worked with McKinsey &amp; Company to open a new supply chain control tower, which would act as a test bed to help businesses explore technologies that would make their supply chains more agile, resilient, and secure.Supply chain optimization is vital to global companies, especially in volatile regions such as ours.ASTAR hopes to use this control tower to demonstrate the potential of industry 4.0 solutions to its partners, allowing them to visualize the positive impact of these solutions on their own supply chain management systems. For instance, demand-sensing technologies can help companies recognize demand patterns and understand consumer behavior better, while other technologies like end-to-end simulations help to verify that the solutions being used work as intended.According to ASTAR, more than 50 companies have already expressed interest in participating in the Supply Chain 4.0 Initiative, including Procter &amp; Gamble and Singapore-based enterprise software provider PD Solutions.“Supply chain optimization is vital to global companies, especially in volatile regions such as ours, where challenges from tariffs, trade policies, natural disasters, and pandemic lockdowns all play a role,” said Sam Garcia, senior vice president of supply chain at Procter &amp; Gamble Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Africa. “Through collaboration with government bodies such as the Economic Development Board and ASTAR, we hope to forge stronger collaborations and innovations in integrated and sustainable technological solutions as foundations upon which agility and resilience can be built.”Transforming sustainablyAnother area in which industry 4.0 can provide massive benefits is sustainability. New technologies can help firms reduce their carbon footprint and impact on the environment and alleviate the effects of climate change. 3D printing, for example, can slash energy usage during manufacturing by 41% to 64%.This is especially important, as business operations are at huge risk of adverse weather conditions due to climate change. For instance, research by McKinsey shows that by 2040, hurricanes will be 2x to 4x more likely to disrupt the supply chains of companies that rely on high-end semiconductor chips for their products.By reducing their impact on the environment, manufacturing companies can help lessen the potentially disastrous effects of such adverse weather events and in doing so, ensure the stability of their own business operations.Photo credit: ASTARTo help companies understand how to apply industry 4.0 solutions in their sustainability efforts, ASTAR, together with Singapore government agency JTC and sustainability solutions provider Tuv Sud, developed the Green Compass initiative. The program offers a set of tools and training courses to help businesses achieve more environment-friendly and resilient business models.Through this initiative, companies can learn how sustainable practices should be applied in each of their businesses, assess their current level of sustainability, prioritize the areas they should focus on, and plan a road map for environment-friendly transformation.While developing the Green Compass Initiative, ASTAR and its partners focused on three key elements. First, it made sure that the framework would be relevant to companies of all sizes so that it could help different types of businesses. Next, the framework had to have the right balance of technical rigor and usability so that firms wouldn’t have difficulties in transitioning to more sustainable business models. Finally, the framework needed to be comprehensive enough to cover all the focal points of sustainable transformation.Image credit: ASTARDuring the Industrial Transformation Asia-Pacific event , ASTAR also showcased its Innovation Factory, a research and development center to help companies explore new sustainable technologies and practices with assistance from ASTAR. The Innovation Factory provides important resources such as equipment, workshops, ideation and consultancy assistance, as well as innovation projects that companies can experiment with.On top of these efforts, ASTAR is exploring carbon capture and utilization methods, which involves recycling carbon dioxide emissions so that they don’t enter and harm the atmosphere. In this area, the agency is working with partners such as the Nanyang Technological University and Surbana Jurong to develop its Carbon Capture and Utilisation Translational Testbed (CCUTT). This initiative aims to provide early research data for carbon capture technologies, allowing companies to implement them quickly, flexibly, and cost-effectively.The horizon of industry 4.0In the coming years, McKinsey expects that further implementation of industry 4.0 practices in the manufacturing industry will generate outstanding opportunities. Improved employee productivity and product quality, among others, are just some of the ways industry 4.0 can revolutionize the future of supply chain management.In the area of sustainability, the various initiatives by ASTAR and its partners could also help companies set up a path to sustainable operations and avoid “billions of dollars” in potential losses due to sustainability-related constraints.“We want to bring the ecosystem of research performance and our partners in universities together in order to work with the industry, understand their problem statements, and help them deliver solutions to make them competitive,” said ASTAR’s Huan.Currency converted from Singapore dollar to US dollar: US$1 = S$1.37.The Agency for Science, Technology and Research (ASTAR) is Singapore’s lead public sector R&amp;D agency.

Informative and witty, it gives you everything you need to know to start your day. Choose the Daily Newsletter option to get it  delivered to your inbox or read it right here on our site.Hello reader,Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. We’ve heard the saying countless times before – teachers and parents always have it handy. The idiom’s origin is believed to be from Miguel Cervantes’ Don Quixote from the early 1600s.More than four centuries later, the phrase is still relevant in society as a quick and easy way to dole out good advice. Ovo would agree. The Indonesian e-wallet has appeared to steadfastly implement this simple yet wise strategy.Despite counting Tokopedia, one of Indonesia’s top ecommerce platforms, as its biggest driver of transactions, Ovo has cleverly cushioned any drop-off in business due to the merger of Tokopedia and Gojek to form GoTo Group. Ovo has reduced its dependence on Tokopedia by inking partnerships with other marketplaces, including Blibli, Zalora, and Lazada.However, with Gojek’s solutions, such as GoPay, now hogging the limelight on Tokopedia’s platform, my colleague Jofie Yordan dives in deep to figure out if Ovo can preserve its status as Indonesia’s top e-wallet and if it really even matters, given that financial services are the monetization endgame for e-wallets.Today we look at:Ovo’s prospects of keeping its crown in Indonesia in light of GoTo’s riseScaler’s quest to become India’s next edtech unicornOther newsy highlights such as Sony joining the gaming industry’s deal mania and the funding frenzy in Southeast AsiaAlso, if you’re an entrepreneur looking for funding, fill out this form to get your company featured on our list of fundraising startups.Premium summaryIn it for the long haulImage credit: Timmy LoenIt is worth noting that Ovo does not have to fend off competition from GoTo Group on its own as the former counts Grab as a majority stakeholder. The Singapore-based super app bought a majority stake in Ovo from Tokopedia and Lippo Group last year.This ensures that, despite the immediate threat from GoTo Group, Ovo has the resources to secure a spot among Indonesia’s top e-wallets in the long term.“E-wallet or mobile payments will not be a winner-takes-all market, and regulators will not let that happen,” Vion Yau, head of insights at research firm Momentum Works, explains. “Even in China, WeChat Pay and Alipay will not completely defeat each other because of their parents’ use cases.”Holding down the fort: While monthly active users don’t tell the full story regarding e-wallets, one third-party estimate shows that the figure has been steadily going up for Ovo. The trend has been apparent amid the Covid-19 pandemic and has held steady even after Tokopedia began shifting to GoPay.Limiting damage: Ovo has taken steps to soften the blow from the Gojek-Tokopedia merger. The e-wallet remains a payment option on Tokopedia but is no longer in the most favorable spots. Furthermore, in line with its existing open-ecosystem strategy, Ovo is available on other ecommerce platforms, including Lazada and Blibli.New avenues: Aldi Adrian Hartanto, vice president of investments at MDI Ventures, believes it’s likely that e-wallet players in Indonesia will start aggressively pushing their buy now, pay later products. Ovo, GoPay, and ShopeePay all offer BNPL. He notes that competition amid the from the cashback wars in the country’s Tier 1 cities is already “bloody”, so Tier 3 and 4 cities are likely to be the next target for e-wallet players.Read more: Can Ovo, ‘shunned’ by Tokopedia, keep the crown?Startup spotlightEntering soonicorn territoryImage credit: Timmy LoenScaler, an India-based upskilling startup in the edtech space, has secured US$55 million in a series B round led by Lightrock India.

Premium subscribers get access to the more comprehensive Executive Brief where we break down the 2 biggest news of the day.Hello readers,Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. We’ve heard the saying countless times before – teachers and parents always have it handy. The idiom’s origin is believed to be from Miguel Cervantes’ Don Quixote in the early 1600s.Yet, more than four centuries later, the phrase is still relevant in society as a quick and easy way to dole out good advice. Ovo would agree. The Indonesian e-wallet has appeared to steadfastly implement this simple yet wise strategy.Despite counting Tokopedia, one of Indonesia’s top ecommerce platforms, as its biggest driver of transactions, Ovo has cleverly cushioned any drop-off in business due to the merger of Tokopedia and Gojek to form GoTo Group. Ovo has reduced its dependence on Tokopedia by inking partnerships with other marketplaces, including Blibli, Zalora, and Lazada.However, with Gojek’s solutions, such as GoPay, now hogging the limelight on Tokopedia’s platform, my colleague Jofie Yordan dives in deep to figure out if Ovo can preserve its status as Indonesia’s top e-wallet and if it really even matters, given that financial services are the monetization endgame for e-wallets.Also, if you’re an entrepreneur looking for funding, fill out this form to get your company featured on our list of fundraising startups.— ShravanthThe Big StoryCan Ovo, ‘shunned’ by Tokopedia, keep the crown?While Ovo is still available as a payment option in Tokopedia, it is no longer in the most favorable position.

Tax incentives for startups increased from three years to four years of incorporation, in view of the pandemic,” the minister said while presenting the union budget in parliament.Indian startups had a blockbuster year in 2021, raising US$42 billion in 2021, up from US$11.5 billion in the previous year, and underscored the significance of the country’s tech ecosystem in the latest budget.The country also minted a record number of unicorns last year, with their number going up to 78, according to data compiled by Tech in Asia.Fine print for Indian startupsAs part of the union budget, Sitharaman also proposed extending the startup tax-holiday scheme to those firms incorporated by March 31, 2023, over and above those startups already eligible for the exemption. The scheme gives startups a tax holiday for three out of seven years from the date of incorporation.Earlier, the tax holiday was available for startups incorporated till March 2022. Last year, too, the minister had announced a similar one-year extensionto the startup tax holiday policy.Image credit: Timmy Loen“Union Budget 2022 is extremely progressive and forward-looking in nature,” Jitin Bhasin, founder of fintech firm SaveIN, said. “Especially for startups, the tax exemption to eligible startups, incorporated before March 31, 2023, is going to provide much-needed cash flow boost to startups in their formative years.”Additionally, VC investors and startup founders are also likely to benefit from a tax tweak, where the surcharge on long-term capital gains tax has been capped at 15% for all listed and unlisted companies, lower than the earlier regime, where the surcharge went up to 37.5%The government has also announced plans to set up a digital university, which will be based on a networked hub-and-spoke model. While the “hub” refers to the country’s public universities and institutions, the “spokes” are individual students who will learn from hubs at home through the digital medium.See also: A list of India’s unicorns and their early investors (Updated)The finance minister also said that the country’s agriculture and rural banks regulator will provide a fund with blended capital to fund agritech startups that are relevant to the value chain of farm produce.The budget also included the launch of Kisan drones, which will be used for crop assessments, land records, and spraying of insecticides. Startups including Skylark Drones and ePlane Company will be potential beneficiaries of the move.Meanwhile, electric vehicle firms will benefit from a new battery swapping policy, where batteries or energy as a service will be pursued as a separate model.“I would have loved if goods and service tax in battery and spare parts had also been reduced to 5%, similar to e-vehicle purchases.

This could be seen as a step towards legalizing cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in India. The government will also tax the receipt of digital assets as gifts and their movement from one wallet to another.The new regulation also states that losses from the sale of digital assets cannot be offset against other income.“We hope that this development removes any ambiguity for banks, and they can provide financial services to the crypto industry,” Nischal Shetty, founder and CEO of crypto exchange WazirX, told Tech in Asia.Meanwhile, Ajeet Khurana, venture partner at Blockchain Founders Fund and resident mentor of 500 Global, told Tech in Asia that the 30% tax rate – which corresponds to the highest tax rate on personal income in India – was “reasonable.”See also: Are state-backed digital currencies a game-changer?On the flipside, the VC partner said investors in digital assets are prone to losing money from hacking and other cybercrime-related activities, and there is a need for clarification on how the government will help tackle such losses.“We hope to work with the government to help bring crypto-asset taxation at par with other asset classes and participate in the central government’s vision to promote economic growth,” said Ashish Singhal, founder and CEO of crypto exchange CoinSwitch and co-chair of Blockchain and Crypto Assets Council.India has 100.7 million crypto owners – the highest in the world – according to BrokerChooser, a broker discovery and comparison platform. The country is also fifth in terms of crypto owners as a percentage of population, with 7.30% of its citizens owning digital currencies.“I am now much more confident of sourcing crypto startups deals.

Informative and witty, it gives you everything you need to know to start your day. Choose the Daily Newsletter option to get it  delivered to your inbox or read it right here on our site.Hello reader,Today, over 2 billion people are celebrating the Lunar New Year and welcoming the Year of the Tiger (specifically, the water tiger), as per the Chinese zodiac. While there isn’t a consensus about the traits of the tiger, as the festival is celebrated by many different cultures with varying traditions, ‌there are general principles around its symbolism.The tiger is considered the king of all animals in Chinese mythology and culture and, as a Zodiac sign, it symbolizes passion, power, courage, confidence, leadership, and strength. That’s quite a set of characteristics, enough to make one envious. However, people don’t need to wait for the Year of the Tiger to invoke these traits. The folks at women-focused fintech startup Lucy stopped waiting a long time ago.The company is on a mission to help underserved women by tailoring a range of financial and non-financial services for them and propel women entrepreneurs to the spotlight. Debbie Watkins, CEO and co-founder of Lucy, has worked in over 35 countries in her more than two-decade-long career.While regularly advising banks and other financial institutions on how to expand their outreach programs to underserved groups, Watkins noticed a particular oddity — something that has become painfully obvious over the years.She observed that the management of these firms was mostly male and, worryingly, the proportion of business loans they were providing was also skewed toward men. With the goal of tackling this issue, Watkins co-founded Lucy with Hal Bosher, ex-CEO of Yoma Bank and head of Wave Money, as well as Luke Janssen, founder and ex-CEO of Tigerspike.Today we look at,Lucy eying US$5 million in series A fundingSoftBank’s latest high-profile resignation Other newsy highlights such as crypto establishing a place for itself in games and cafes and Ola’s dash to add dark storesAnd finally, wishing our readers a happy and prosperous Lunar New Year!Premium summaryUnleashing the beastImage credit: Timmy LoenFintech firm Lucy, which aims to support entrepreneurial women from economically weaker sections, tells Tech in Asia that it is currently in talks with investors to raise up to US$5 million in a series A funding round.“Empowering women entrepreneurs to succeed is one of the biggest potential catalysts for economic growth in the ‘new normal.’ Lucy has been designed from the ground up to help them realize their potential, to grow, thrive, and shine,” Watkins says.Community building: The Singapore-based firm will use the capital from the upcoming fundraise to roll out features such as a rewards program. It will also invest in developing its community platform by adding e-learning courses and a mentorship and coaching program. Watkins did not divulge Lucy’s growth figures but says the firm is “getting deep engagement” across its client segments.Next stop, Hong Kong: Lucy will also expand to markets outside Singapore this year, with Hong Kong set to be its next stop. It also plans to set up shop in Indonesia and the Philippines and expand its current team of 12 employees. The new hires will be for its data analysis, product development, and cybersecurity teams.No woman left out: Lucy’s platform addresses some of the key challenges that face less wealthy entrepreneurs. These include the lack of access to loans due to the absence of collateral and limited interest from mainstream financial institutions. Lucy also aims to aid female domestic help who don’t have a debit card or can’t easily wire money back to their native countries.Read more: Women-focused fintech firm eyes $5m series A fundingNews spotlightThe man who asked his boss for a US$2 billion paycheckMarcelo Claure/Photo credit: SoftBankYes, you read that right. Unsurprisingly, he did not get his payout, which led to a high-profile resignation from the ranks of SoftBank Group Corporation.Marcelo Claure, the CEO of SoftBank Group International (SBGI) and the COO of SoftBank Group Corporation, left the company last week amid reports of a clash over compensation with company founder Masayoshi Son. This was not the first time the pair were at loggerheads, as they were also at odds over the spinoff of the company’s Latin American investment fund.A dream payday: Claure was seeking nearly US$2 billion in compensation over the next few years. Son and other SoftBank executives, however, wanted to shell out a much smaller sum. Interestingly, Claure was already one of the highest-paid executives at SoftBank, having reportedly made US$17 million in 2020.Au revoir, friend: Claure, who spent nearly nine years at SoftBank, rose through the ranks to become a close confidant of CEO Masayoshi Son. He also played a major role in SoftBank’s deals with startups like Uber and WeWork.An apt appointment: Following Claure’s departure, Michel Combes, who served as president of SBGI, was appointed as its CEO. Combes joined SBGI in April 2020 and served on the boards of directors at SoftBank portfolio companies such as WeWork, OneWeb, SoFi Technologies, Contentsquare, Jellysmack, and Swile.Quick bytes1️⃣ Crypto as currencyNetmarble, a South Korea-based gaming giant, is set to issue its own crypto token to act as a key currency for its games. The development comes as the company looks to launch its own play-to-earn title, Everybody’s Marble: Metaworld, globally later this year. However, the game won’t be available in South Korea, as local regulations bar the release of such games.2️⃣ A dash in the darkOla, an India-based mobility firm, has announced plans to expand its quick commerce service Ola Dash.

Premium subscribers get access to the more comprehensive Executive Brief where we break down the 2 biggest news of the day.Hello readers,Today, over 2 billion people are celebrating the Lunar New Year and welcoming the Year of the Tiger (specifically, the water tiger), as per the Chinese zodiac. While there isn’t a consensus about the traits of the tiger, as the festival is celebrated by many different cultures with varying traditions, ‌there are general principles around its symbolism.The tiger is considered the king of all animals in Chinese mythology and culture and, as a Zodiac sign, it symbolizes passion, power, courage, confidence, leadership, and strength. That’s quite a set of characteristics, enough to make one envious. However, people don’t need to wait for the Year of the Tiger to invoke these traits. The folks at women-focused fintech startup Lucy stopped waiting a long time ago.The company is on a mission to help underserved women by tailoring a range of financial and non-financial services for them and propel women entrepreneurs to the spotlight. Debbie Watkins, CEO and co-founder of Lucy, has worked in over 35 countries in her more than two-decade-long career.While regularly advising banks and other financial institutions on how to expand their outreach programs to underserved groups, Watkins noticed a particular oddity — something that has become painfully obvious over the years.She observed that the management of these firms was mostly male and, worryingly, the proportion of business loans they were providing was also skewed toward men. With the goal of tackling this issue, Watkins co-founded Lucy with Hal Bosher, ex-CEO of Yoma Bank and head of Wave Money, as well as Luke Janssen, founder and ex-CEO of Tigerspike.And finally, wishing our readers a happy and prosperous Lunar New Year!— ShravanthThe Big StoryWomen-focused fintech firm eyes $5m series A fundingLucy plans to roll its services out in Hong Kong, Indonesia, and the Philippines.

However, it is back to business the week after. Don’t worry, the Daily Newsletters will continue to land in your inbox every day.Premium summaryStick a horn on it already!Image credit:Timmy LoenIndonesia is Southeast Asia’s second most prolific unicorn hub after Singapore. The largest archipelago in the world has 11 unicorns after adding six from last year alone.While there’s no formal criteria for soonicorns, Tech in Asia looked at Indonesian companies that are valued above US$500 million. So far, eight homegrown startups fit the bill, and three of them are less than US$200 million away from hitting unicorn status.Younger and quicker: While more mature startups like Ruangguru, Qraved, and SiCepat Ekspres took five to seven years before becoming soonicorns, younger companies are joining the club much faster. B2B marketplace GudangAda, for instance, sped past the US$500 million mark in just three years, while its competitor Ula achieved the same feat in less than two. Of course, it helps that B2B ecommerce is a hot space.An exception: A company that we excluded from the soonicorn list but will likely be part of it sometime soon is Kredivo. The buy now, pay later startup’s US$2.5 billion SPAC merger has yet to take place, and its current valuation is US$456 million, according to VentureCap Insights.A diverse set of backers: There are some investors that have more than one Indonesian soonicorn in their portfolio. These investors hail from 11 countries worldwide, perhaps indicating continued confidence in the size of Indonesia’s digital economy. About 47% of soonicorn backers are based in Indonesia and Singapore, while the rest are from outside Southeast Asia.Read more: Counting Indonesia’s soonicorns and their backersStartup spotlightKindly check this box for fundingCheckbox founders Evan  Wong and James Han/ Photo credit: CheckboxCheckbox, a no-code platform, has raised US$4.5 million in a pre-series A funding round led by Tidal Ventures and Surge, Sequoia India’s scale-up program.

It will also use a significant part of the funds to formally open an office in the US and hire local sales and marketing resources.Coveted clients: Checkbox offers services to organizations like Allianz, Telstra, Air New Zealand, PwC, Coca-Cola Europacific Partners, and Invisalign. Enterprises and government agencies in Australia, New Zealand, Asia, and the US also use the no-code platform’s offerings.Quick bytes1️⃣ Square peg hopes this is no round holeCialfo, a Singapore-based edtech firm, has raised US$40 million in a series B round led by Square Peg and Seek Investments.

730858,2022-01-31T05:00:36,2022-02-02T03:42:18,"Can Ovo, ‘shunned’ by Tokopedia, keep the crown?",ovo-shunned-tokopedia-crown,post,"When super app Gojek and ecommerce player Tokopedia merged to become GoTo Group, one of the first questions that came up was, what would happen to Ovo? The Indonesian e-wallet counts Tokopedia as its biggest use case driver.Gojek had its own digital wallet in GoPay, and Ovo was affiliated with the decacorn’s archrival Grab. But there were also regulatory reasons: Bank Indonesia – the country’s central bank – does not allow any single entity to hold two e-money licenses simultaneously.In January 2020, the strategy and timeline were still vague, though a gradual process seemed more likely than a clean break. Tokopedia, however, just made a major move towards the future: Gojek’s solutions are now front and center in the ecommerce platform.Screenshot of GoPay in the Tokopedia appCashback points, for instance, are now offered in the form of GoPay coins. Meanwhile, many of Tokopedia’s app-wide discounts are given in exchange for using services like GoPaylater.Ovo is still available as a payment option, but it’s no longer in the most favorable placements.“In the coming month or maximum a year, it will begin to appear that Ovo’s [market] position will gradually decrease and possibly GoPay will take over,” says Aldi Adrian Hartanto, vice president of investments at MDI Ventures.Ovo has taken steps to soften the blow. In line with its existing open-ecosystem strategy, the e-wallet is available as a payment option in other ecommerce platforms, including Lazada and Blibli.Ovo is “​​further expanding its use cases and driving adoption within the core payment business, as well as expanding its financial services verticals,” a company spokesperson tells Tech in Asia.Still, it may not matter whether Tokopedia’s volume can be replaced, as long as Ovo succeeds in building a strong foundation of financial services, which is where the real money lies.The strongest ecosystem winsIn a way, Ovo may have already lost its status as Indonesia’s top e-wallet by late 2020. A report from Ipsos and Bank Indonesia put then-newcomer ShopeePay as the leading e-wallet based on transaction values.ShopeePay didn’t necessarily encroach on a rival’s turf since Ovo wasn’t available on Shopee, anyway. Losing Tokopedia, however, would affect Ovo differently. Not only is it being replaced by its close competitor GoPay, but Tokopedia is also one of Indonesia’s top two ecommerce platforms.Tokopedia’s scale isn’t easily replaceable. According to estimates by research firm Momentum Works, the ecommerce firm’s gross merchandise value for 2020 was at US$14 billion. In comparison, even the regional business of Grab – Ovo’s remaining backer – is smaller at US$12.5 billion. Of course, Ovo is unavailable to Grab’s users in markets outside Indonesia.Teaming up with Bukalapak may make some sense for Ovo, considering the burgeoning alliance between Grab and Emtek Group, a local conglomerate that has invested in the ecommerce firm. But Tokopedia’s scale is formidable: even combining Bukalapak and Lazada – Indonesia’s other second-tier ecommerce platform – would yield only about half of Tokopedia’s size.Plus, even though Ovo is available on both platforms, it is not an exclusive arrangement as peers like Dana or LinkAja are also present on Lazada and Bukalapak.Ovo’s advantage – for now, at least – is that it remains available on Tokopedia instead of being immediately phased out.There’s also the Grab ecosystem in Indonesia, which seems to be the leader in both ride-hailing and food delivery. Momentum Works research estimates that in 2021, GrabFood got a 49% market share, outpacing GoFood’s 43%.“Ovo still has the users [it had] acquired and retained over the years, and Grab is building up more use cases which Ovo will be part of,” explains Vion Yau, head of insights at Momentum Works.Indeed, while monthly active users (MAU) don’t tell the full story when it comes to e-wallets, one third-party estimate shows that figure has been steadily increasing for Ovo. This is apparent amid the Covid-19 pandemic, and it remained stable even after Tokopedia began shifting to GoPay.Yau adds that Ovo now focus on building its own financial ecosystem instead of being occupied with Grab or Tokopedia’s priorities. Financial services are the monetization endgame for e-wallets, and Ovo has been making strides into that space for some time now.Operating as an independent player will allow Ovo to stay flexible. Yau says that based on feedback Momentum Works has heard from the ground, many users find Ovo to be more intuitive to use, unlike GoPay or ShopeePay, which are embedded in larger apps.Ovo can also build more features with more flexibility compared with the embedded players.“You can see trading stocks on the Ovo app, but it can be awkward to trade on the Gojek, Tokopedia or Shopee apps, for example,” she says. “Ovo’s prospects come down to how they are able to continue their lead position by building a digital finance ecosystem on top of Grab’s use cases.”An uncertain futureOf course, things could still change moving forward. MDI Ventures’ Hartanto believes that GoTo has no incentive to keep Ovo on the Tokopedia platform. The status quo is just a transition process benefitting Tokopedia consumers who are used to Ovo.“At the moment, they just want to make sure people are getting used to GoPay, and they are trying to give more incentives to users who use it,” he observes. “In the end, Tokopedia will reach a point where they see that their users are more comfortable using GoPay and are ready to cut off Ovo.”Ovo will likely have some sort of tie-up with Grab’s digital banking ambitions. In late 2021, Emtek acquired Bank Fama International, and just last week, Grab and SingTel injected US$70 million into the Bandung-headquarted bank. The telco titan is also a partner in Grab’s digibank efforts in Singapore. And along with with Bukalapak, the super app had invested in Jakarta-based Allo Bank as well.That said, it’s unclear where Ovo fits in all this. The company’s spokesperson did not comment specifically on the matter, but she said that Ovo will continue to focus on its core businesses of digital payments and digital financial services.Similarly, the outcome of Ovo’s long-rumored merger with Emtek-backed Dana remains uncertain.The combined company could have easily taken the pole position in Indonesia’s e-wallet race, but the deal appears to have been complicated by the failed Grab-Gojek merger. A source previously told Tech in Asia that the Ovo-Dana deal had only needed government approval, but it was put on hold due to negotiations at the parent level.Ultimately, though, Ovo’s importance in the ecosystem remains secure.“E-wallet or mobile payments will not be a winner-takes-all market, and regulators will not let that happen,” Yau explains. “Even in China, WeChat Pay and Alipay will not completely defeat each other because of their parents’ use cases.”The Ovo app / Photo credit: OvoHartanto agrees with that notion, adding that it’s likely that e-wallet players in Indonesia will start aggressively pushing their buy now, pay later products. GoPay and ShopeePay all offer BNPL. Ovo also once offered the feature, but it was removed in 2020.He also sees that competition in the country’s Tier 1 cities is already “bloody” from the cashback wars, so Tier 3 and 4 cities have the potential to be the next target for these e-wallet players. It’s a similar to the ecommerce playbook, where the likes of Mitra Bukalapak and Mitra Tokopedia aim to capture a group of still underserved markets.“The majority of wallet shares in first-tier cities have been captured by all of the players. They already have their positions … and their own blocks,” Hartanto explains. “Other markets like the US or India are also starting to shift their competition to these uncharted territories.”","While Ovo is still available as a payment option in Tokopedia, it is no longer in the most favorable position. But that may not matter in the long term.",558171,Jofie Yordan,True,Putra Muskita and Eileen C.

We break down the big and messy topics of Asia’s tech and startup community. Get the newsletter in your inbox everyday with a Premium subscription.Hi readers,I do the groceries in my household. It’s a weekly run that I used to enjoy.I don’t revel in the process anymore because of a pandemic-induced paranoia toward crowded spaces, made worse by Malaysia’s lax enforcement of prevention measures. Authorities recently uncovered syndicates offering fake Covid-19 vaccination certificates. Yikes.But my family still needs to eat. So I set a timer and try to complete my grocery run in under 30 minutes, which is still challenging.But what if the entire process could be simplified? Maybe tap into an app, select groceries, pay, and choose to either get it delivered in less than 30 minutes or pick it up myself if I’m in the area.That’s what quick commerce (q-commerce) offers, and, with dark stores, it’s become a reality today.Foodpanda got a head start in the space with its dark stores, or Pandamarts, since 2019 – well before Covid-19 ran riot. It has more than 50 Pandamarts in Malaysia, including in Sabah and Sarawak. It has also partnered with large hypermarket chains and hyperlocal favorites.But the teething issue – at least in my opinion – is that Foodpanda doesn’t own a grocery store. That’s why Grab’s acquisition of Jaya Grocer, a Malaysian superstore chain, is interesting. Not only is it the ride-hailing giant’s first physical acquisition after its IPO, it’s also a move to capture a vital component of the grocery supply chain.Jaya Grocer has the expertise in logistics, manpower, sourcing of food stuff, and that makes it easier for Grab to be a dominant player in the space.That said, Jaya Grocer does not have a presence in East Malaysia. But I doubt this will be a longstanding problem.Like all acquisitions, challenges and opportunities abound – beyond the usual corporate buzzwords of “catalyst,” “synergy,” and “scale”. The net effect of the Jaya Grocer acquisition is that it boosts Grab’s super-app ambitions.But here’s what I’m thinking: Paranoid people like me may find themselves in the minority since Malaysia has eased travel restrictions. People will still want to go back to the good ol’ days of physically shopping for groceries, which in turn might hurt the q-commerce blitz.We have glimpses of that right now. For example, Google’s Covid-19 Community Mobility Report for Malaysia showed that trips made to supermarkets and pharmacies on January 12 were up 21% nationwide from the previous week.If this trend persists, then q-commerce players will need a hedge. What better moat than a grocery chain where you can enjoy both online and offline purchases? That makes the Jaya Grocer acquisition a pretty good one for Grab, intentional or otherwise.– Emmanuel Samarathisa, journalist at Tech in AsiaTop stories this weekImage credit: Timmy Loen1️.

While a greater share of funding went to startups run by women in 2021, the share still hovered around the 2% mark.Singapore-based Lucy, a women-focused fintech startup, is looking to address these challenges of financing by offering personalized fintech solutions.The company told Tech in Asia it is currently in talks with investors to raise up to US$5 million in a series A funding round.Lucy CEO Debbie Watkins / Photo credit: LucyIn November 2020, Lucy came into the spotlight after it raised US$365,787 in  pre-seed round – in which the investors were all women.In August 2021, the firm raised US$1 million in a seed funding round from EmergeVest, a Hong Kong-based private equity firm. It also received an undisclosed sum by way of a grant from the United Nations Capital Development Fund last year.Even though there are miles to go before the larger problem is solved for women entrepreneurs, Lucy aims to do its bit by supporting entrepreneurial women from economically weaker sections.The financial empowerment of women can help alleviate overall poverty, according to an HBR report. The report also notes that a working woman keeps 90% of her income aside for her family – significantly higher than the 35% that men invest into their families.See also: Lewd advances, unwanted touches: SEA women founders, execs speak outAt the same time, women-led businesses are a relatively safe bet for investors. Women-founded startups generate 78 cents for every US dollar of funding – almost 2x the average – according to a BCG report.Over her career spanning more than two decades, Debbie Watkins, CEO and co-founder of Lucy, encountered the lack of female representation in the entrepreneurial space. Watkins has worked in more than 35 countries and advised banks and other financial institutions on how to expand their outreach programs to underserved groups.She observed that the management of these firms was mostly male. The proportion of business loans they were providing was also skewed toward men.To address this gender gap, Watkins co-founded Lucy with Hal Bosher, ex-CEO of Yoma Bank and head of Wave Money, and Luke Janssen, founder and ex-CEO of Tigerspike.Serving underserved womenWatkins describes Lucy as a neobank focused on providing a tailored range of financial and non-financial services to women.While it strives to be inclusive to all women, Lucy’s objective is to serve women entrepreneurs who already have a business or are planning to start one.The platform addresses some of the key challenges that face less wealthy entrepreneurs. These include the lack of access to loans due to the absence of collateral, as well as limited interest from mainstream financial institutions. Lucy also aims to reach out to female domestic help who don’t have a debit card or can’t easily wire money back to their native countries.Photo credit: Lucy“We’ve designed products specifically to address the pain points of helpers, and home-based microentrepreneurs or individual microentrepreneurs,” Watkins told Tech in Asia.Lucy has partnered with Mastercard to offer a prepaid “Lucy Mastercard” that charges no fees and does not have a minimum balance requirement. Clients can have multiple cards to keep track of their money better.For remittances, it allows users to send money in the Philippines and Indonesia at lower costs any time through their phones.Lucy’s platform also allows users to create separate accounts for different purposes, such as allowing employers and employees to manage loans, among other things.See also: 15 female founders in Southeast Asia who are smashing the glass ceilingExpansion on the cardsWatkins did not divulge Lucy’s growth figures since its launch but said the firm is “getting deep engagement” across all of its client segments.Watkins added that the company will use the capital from the upcoming fundraise to roll out additional features such as a rewards program. It will also invest in developing its community platform by adding e-learning courses as well as a mentorship and coaching program.Lucy will also expand to markets outside Singapore this year, with Hong Kong set to be its next pit stop. It also plans to set up shop in Indonesia and the Philippines.Watkins said that the company will also expand its current team of 12 employees. The new hirings will be across verticals, especially data analysis, product development, and cybersecurity.Ahead of its imminent fundraise, the startup was selected as a finalist in the “Future of Work” category at the 14th annual SXSW Pitch, formerly known as SXSW Accelerator.“Empowering women entrepreneurs to succeed is one of the biggest potential catalysts for economic growth in the ‘new normal.’ Lucy has been designed from the ground up to help them realize their potential, to grow, thrive, and shine,” Watkins said in a statement.","Lucy plans to roll its services out in Hong Kong, Indonesia, and the Philippines.",580372,Kul Bhushan,True,Collin Furtado and Arpit Nayak,0,"['Fintech', 'Investments', 'News', 'Premium Content']","['community for women', 'EmergeVest', 'female founders', 'fintech', 'funding for women startups', 'Lucy', 'series A funding', 'Singapore', 'women startups']",False,,True,True,True,False,4

The 26-year-old corporation was also at the forefront of the archipelago’s transition from 3G to 4G and its more recent shift to 5G.Despite its achievements, Telkomsel understands that “being a telecommunications company is not enough to provide meaningful transformations for both today’s and the future’s generations,” says Derrick Heng, the company’s chief marketing officer.Listening to the winds of changeTelkomsel sees the rise of over-the-top services like Spotify, Netflix, and WhatsApp as proof of the inevitable: Digital channels have become our primary route for connecting and engaging with the world. In light of this, it became clear to the telco that it had to modernize ahead of its users.Derrick Heng, Telkomsel’s chief marketing officer / Photo credit: TelkomselAlongside the government’s push for the digital transformation of Indonesia’s businesses and citizens, Telkomsel has doubled down on its efforts to remain a key player in the country’s accelerating digital growth.However, change can be intimidating and even be paralyzing for big corporations that serve millions of customers. To ensure that these large-scale changes were built and implemented holistically without impacting ongoing operations, Telkomsel worked with long-time partner McKinsey &amp; Company and its advanced analytics arm QuantumBlack.A team of interdisciplinary venture builders, data domain experts, and strategy consultants planned how Telkomsel could better enable its customers to fully embrace today’s digital lifestyle.Knowledge as foundationThe first and foundational change involved major upgrades to Telkomsel’s data systems, which essentially involved building a new data analytics platform. Today, the company’s upgraded capabilities boast “more than 9,000 data points available per consumer, fully modular and reusable across all business units,” says Heng. Automatic, quality-checked data pipelines and a new suite of AI-driven tools have also produced “10x improvement in data quality.”This gives Telkomsel a complete view of every customer, which can then be used to improve their experience across various touchpoints while also allowing for “more accurate and faster decision-making” at the company, adds Heng.With its improved systems, Telkomsel was able to identify consumers who were still relying on 3G connectivity even as their data needs were growing. This was the company’s first step towards providing a better user experience (UX).Meeting customers where they areUpdating its analytics also alerted Telkomsel to the fact that despite being the market leader, it lacked a digital-first brand association among younger users, who expect seamless digital experiences across multiple touchpoints and are very particular about which brands they choose to support. With Indonesia’s Gen Z segment already averaging 8.5 hours of data consumption a day, the telco’s second objective was to secure its relevance to these digital natives.Photo credit: madebydubo/123rfTelkomsel engaged experts from Leap by McKinsey, the consulting firm’s business building and scaling arm, in order to establish By.U, Indonesia’s first digital telco, from the ground up.The team designed, built, and launched an all-digital customer experience – from onboarding and quota management to top-ups and payments – to reflect the spirit of the target consumers. That informed the development of By.U’s internal processes as well: a culture of agile processes that promotes collaborative working and a fit-for-purpose technological stack were put in place.Heng notes how significant plays like this often come with unseen challenges. “The early stages of our collaboration were very challenging, but there were many interesting and new things that we could learn from and use as a basis for improvement and development.”For By.U, the debate revolved around whether to build slowly, or to take a minimum viable product (MVP) to market faster and finetune the product-market fit afterwards.Ultimately, the team chose the latter route, creating a series of social media tests to observe clickthrough rates on features, which allowed them to develop an MVP quickly. The service debuted to around 30,000 customers on the pre-launch waitlist and then hit its one-year customer acquisition goal in just six months. Fifteen months after launch, By.U has over 2 million subscribers under its belt, with market-leading net promoter scores.The complex path to simplicityTelkomsel’s third transformation goal revolved around making customer interactions with the telco “as seamless, convenient, and personalized as possible” – a simple mission, but one that’s hard to execute. After initial attempts to improve the user interface of its existing mobile app, one thing became clear: A completely new app – backed by an overhaul of supporting back-end systems – was needed to fulfill the needs of increasingly digital-savvy customers.Telkomsel bit the bullet and made changes to its core technological backbone, transitioning to a cloud-based architecture while simultaneously planning product development and commercial strategies. Features included higher transparency of customer usage through real-time monitoring and alerts, seamless digital payment options, and more brand partnerships, which the company believes will be instrumental to “increasing Indonesia’s digital economy,” according to Heng.As a result, Telkomsel reports that its new app has netted 20 million downloads within a year of its launch and now handles 80% of the telco’s transactions.All hands on deckAlthough transformation begins with technology, the journey involves far more than that.“Without the right skills and talent in place, no data or digital platform – no matter how powerful – would perform to its potential or withstand technological evolution,” Heng emphasizes.To that end, the company’s transformation process included efforts to ensure that employee mindsets were tuned towards prioritizing purpose and agility. An agile recruiting process was also created to attract, onboard, and train Indonesian talents from the data science, software engineering, product ownership, and UX fields. This required a fresh approach to talent management, including new perspectives in employer branding, career paths for newer roles, and establishing an in-house academy for upskilling.Photo credit: ferli / 123rfHeng credits the driving force of a fully aligned company for the success of this transformational push, along with shareholders, stakeholders, and strategic partners like McKinsey.Constant vigilanceIn a market like Indonesia, where wireless connectivity is necessary to ensure that wider territories have access to the internet, change and disruption will always be around the corner.

Behind the scenes, the Indonesian government has pushed for more startups to join the unicorn list. It recently launched the Merah Putih Fund, which is aimed at soon-to-be unicorns or soonicorns.There’s no formal criteria for soonicorns, but for this piece, we looked at Indonesian companies that are valued above US$500 million. So far, eight homegrown startups fit the bill, and three of them are less than US$200 million away from hitting unicorn status.Vidio is one example. The Emtek Group-backed entertainment site’s valuation reached US$900 million after its first external funding in November 2021. At the time, its pre-money valuation was US$750 million, but it is unclear how long the company had been hovering around that number.A company that we excluded from the soonicorn list but will likely to bypass it sometime soon is Kredivo. The buy now, pay later startup’s US$2.5 billion SPAC merger has yet to take place, and its current valuation is US$456 million, according to VentureCap Insights.Another fintech company to watch is LinkAja. Although its valuations are not public, the e-wallet is backed by a bunch of state-owned enterprises and unicorns like Grab and Gojek. It’s popular in Indonesia’s Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities.See also: A list of SEA’s soonicorns and their early backersWe also found that while more mature startups like Ruangguru, Qraved, and SiCepat Ekspres took five to seven years before becoming soonicorns, younger companies are joining the club much faster.B2B marketplace GudangAda, for instance, sped past the US$500 million mark in just three years. Its close competitor Ula achieved the same feat in less than two.Of course, it helps that B2B ecommerce is a hot space. Both Ula and GudangAda target warungs or traditional mom and pop shops, which account for the majority of domestic retail transactions. These companies have also expanded further with new initiatives such as Ula’s credit product and established plans for international expansion.Just months after its series A funding in 2021, Ula moved to the next round with injections from big investors, including Tencent and Amazon honcho Jeff Bezos.We also look at the investors backing these companies, and some of them already have more than one soonicorn in their portfolio.These investors hail from 11 countries worldwide, perhaps indicating continued confidence in the size of Indonesia’s digital economy. About 47% soonicorn investors are based in Indonesia and Singapore, while the other 53% are from outside Southeast Asia.Soonicorn founders also come from various countries. The graphic below features founders and co-founders of Indonesian soonicorns, along with their positions in the companies they’ve founded.Many of these co-founders were colleagues at previous companies. Ula’s Nipun Mehra and Alan Wong worked for their now-investor Jeff Bezos at Amazon, while Qraved’s co-founders worked at global incubator Rocket Internet and are also managing tech developer Imaginato.Lemonilo’s co-founders initially built medtech startup Konsula upon returning from their study in the US. But East Ventures-backed Konsula only lasted a year, hampered by stagnant growth and tight competition.See also: A list of SEA’s unicorns and their early investorsIn the future, it’s likely that more startups will hit soonicorn status faster, especially in industries that have benefited from the pandemic like ecommerce, transport, and fintech.“The digital media industry also has great potential, along with the growing demand for entertainment,” says Paulus Jimmy, an equity research analyst at Sucor Sekuritas.This is backed by projections from Google, Bain, and Temasek in their report released in November, which also predicted that Indonesia’s internet economy value will reach US$146 billion by 2025.According to Robertus Hardy, head of research at asset management firm Henan Putihrai Sekuritas, plenty of soonicorns will emerge “very soon” in Indonesia, given the possible abundance of liquidity in private market funding.However, regulatory risks could derail Indonesia’s soonicorn growth trajectory, especially the omnibus law, which was recently deemed unconstitutional. If the government fails to revise the law within two years as expected by the Constitutional Court, then foreign investors may hesitate to pour in money, explains Hardy.Another setback could be the execution risk, since “the sustainability of Indonesian startups in its early stage is still quite low compared to other countries,” he adds.CreditsGraphics: Budi SutrisnoEditing: Tay Tian Wen, Putra Muskita, and Eileen C.

The ecommerce aggregator giant reportedly paid US$150 million to US$200 million for the deal, its first acquisition in the country.Thrasio’s CEO noted that India is a “long-term bet.” Half a billion dollars have been set aside as “a baseline commitment” and part of Thrasio’s China manufacturing will be moved to India.The US roll-up major’s India debut comes at a time when its model has been cloned by local startups at an unprecedented pace. For instance, GlobalBees and Mensa Brands joined the unicorn club within a year.Here’s our take:Thrasio is one of the pioneers in rolling up ecommerce brands, particularly third-party sellers on Amazon. In just three years, it has popularized the business model to the point where hundreds of similar startups are operating worldwide.In March 2021, Tech in Asia saw how the trend was picking up and soon after, it spilled over to Southeast Asia. Thrasio-style firms like Rainforest and Una Brands began springing up in the region.With a valuation of at least US$5 billion, Thrasio has become a beast with an enormous appetite. It’s reportedly buying 1.5 businesses a week and has amassed a portfolio of about 200 brands.Marketplace Pulse estimates that Amazon aggregators worldwide raised about US$12 billion in 2021. / Image credit: MarketplacePulseThere’s a roll-up frenzy in India; we estimate that nearly US$1 billion has been poured into local players within a couple of years. Mensa Brands and GlobalBees lead the pack in terms of funding raised, bagging about US$300 million each (counting both equity and debt).Why India? The short answer is that it’s potentially a massive market. RedSeer Consulting projects that by 2030, the Indian online retail market will become the world’s third largest after the US and China. The country is also undergoing a revolution in direct-to-consumer brands, fueled by pandemic-induced demand.With Thrasio now in the arena, the roll-up race in India is bound to go up a notch.Clearly, Thrasio isn’t guaranteed a smooth ride in the country. Despite growing fast, ecommerce as a share of India’s entire retail market is still relatively low and is expected to reach 7.8% in 2022, according to eMarketer.The US roll-up major was credited with creating the Amazon aggregator category. The model works because Amazon can provide aggregators with quick access to transparent data on third-party sellers. That is often not the case with other marketplaces or D2C brands.Unlike its pole position in the US, Amazon doesn’t dominate in India despite having invested about US$6.5 billion since 2013. The US tech behemoth has been facing mounting regulatory pressures in the South Asian country.Third-party sellers on marketplaces like Flipkart and Nykaa or D2C brands can be attractive acquisition targets, but the model has to be localized.In fact, GlobalBees has snapped up 15 D2C brands in just months. Its CEO noted that the company doesn’t want to model itself after Thrasio, adding that its brands will also operate brick-and-mortar stores. In fragmented markets like India, taking the omnichannel approach is the way to go.In its home turf, Thrasio itself is teaming up with brick-and-mortar retailers, signaling the growing importance of physical stores even for digital-first brands.But it might not have the early-mover advantage in India, where in some cases, a bunch of buyers are vying for the same assets. This means higher valuations can be a roadblock to Thrasio India’s acquiring spree. The heated market could drive brand founders to rush towards the exit door without building strong fundamentals for their businesses.Nonetheless, Thrasio’s entrance is expected to trigger consolidation in India’s roll-up playground.The company has tasked the co-founder of Lifelong, its local partner, to lead the operations for Thrasio India. If things go well, Southeast Asia could be its next target.— HuongNEWS YOU SHOULD KNOWCheck out Tech in Asia’s coverage of the ecommerce scene here.1️⃣ Chinese fast-fashion giant Shein has reportedly revamped its plan to list in the US, according to Reuters.

As of August 2021, Jokr was reportedly losing US$159 per order in the US despite being “operationally profitable” in the first few cities where it was launched.Similarly, Gopuff is also loss-making at an operating level, though it says it is “contribution profit positive.”In a bid to boost margins, Jokr is now mulling the introduction of longer delivery times and private-label products. Gopuff is also looking at pursuing a similar strategy.While India’s quick commerce market is still nascent, it could potentially buck the trend in US and crack the unit economics, given the traction it is currently seeing.“I respect the Flipkart management, but I beg to differ,” says Dimpy Dewan, a former Paytm executive and co-founder of Hanchens, an enabler of quick commerce.Hanchens is helping set up dark stores for Tata-backed healthcare firm 1mg and others like social commerce player DealShare, produce-focused startup Fresh to Home, and B2B platform Udaan.While stakeholders in the online grocery delivery space believe that the best way to acquire customers is to shorten delivery times, several industry experts question the model’s viability in the long run.“If you’re offering free delivery, of course people will pick it up. But can you sustain it?” asks Anup Jain, managing partner at Orios Venture Partners, an early-stage VC firm.He points out that products sold on online delivery platforms don’t offer wide enough margins to sustain a business in the quick commerce space.Photo credit: Tech in AsiaHowever, Swiggy has a competitive edge as its instant delivery arm benefits from an existing pool of consumers already served by its food delivery business.Online grocers make money on orders in two ways: ‌product margins and delivery fees.Currently, Zepto and Blinkit do not charge delivery fees. On the flipside, Swiggy’s Instamart charges a minimum of 15 rupees (US$0.20) per order and Dunzo a minimum of 25 rupees (US$0.34) per delivery.The experts unanimously agree that all online grocery firms will soon start charging delivery fees to compensate for the thin margins.“Zepto, Blinkit, and BigBasket, among others, are currently selling products at a minimal product margin,” a food and delivery expert tells Tech in Asia.The expert says that once online grocers operate at a larger scale, they could also potentially negotiate more favorable margins from retailers.The cost of delivering an order depends on the distance between a dark store and a customer’s address as well as the amount of time it takes to complete the delivery.For example, a consumer is charged about 15 rupees if they choose to receive an order via Swiggy’s Instamart in 20 to 25 minutes. After accounting for product and delivery costs, Swiggy would likely earn between 8% to 12% of the order value on deliveries within a 1 kilometer radius, according to the expert.However, online grocers could benefit from combining multiple deliveries, which could cut transportation costs by half.A Swiggy delivery agent at a university campus / Photo credit: SwiggyIf companies can drive large enough volumes from dark stores, it could reach a point where each dark store is profitable, the expert adds.The expert also says that most companies have a limited amount of inventory at the moment.In our previous coverage, we found that it cost about US$30,000 toset up a dark store, which translates to around US$9 million for 300 stores.See also: Dark stores light up red-hot grocery delivery marketBlinkit founder Albinder Dhindsa recently told The Economic Times that the path to profitability for quick commerce hinges on two volatile factors: competition and execution.Albinder Dhindsa, co-founder and CEO of Blinkit / Photo credit: The WeekBlinkit currently operates 250 dark stores and plans to run 550 by the end of January. Tech in Asia reached out to the firm, but it did not clarify whether it has already opened 300 more stores.Notably, the push to make quick commerce profitable comes against the backdrop of offering deep discounts to attract customers.“I don’t see why grocery delivery firms won’t be going for aggressive discounting practices for the foreseeable next six to nine months,” the food and delivery expert says.A company needs to deliver about 1,000 orders per day to hit break even at a dark store, according to a top executive from an Indian grocery firm.Blinkit has been delivering about 125,000 orders daily. Considering that each of its 250 dark stores delivers about 500 orders per day on average, it is likely halfway to breaking even.Zepto has 100 dark stores; each has the capacity to deliver over 2,500 orders per day. The company could reportedly hit 100,000 orders a day by the end of January, which would bring it to the verge of breaking even on a per store basis.Cracking the hyperfast delivery modelThese online grocers operate a network of dark stores, which often limit deliveries to a mile and a half or less. Each dark store typically stocks between 1,500 and 5,000 items, compared with 35,000 products typically available at a supermarket. These dark stores are not open to the public for direct retail.A Zepto dark store / Photo credit: ZeptoTo make the pickup process efficient, items at a dark store are placed on the most optimal routes for store personnel. Companies also use location intelligence to set the network of dark stores closer to customers, based on the density of demand in an area.With investors funding the operations for now, online grocery firms offer free or low-cost delivery and avoid marking up prices by keeping their overheads low, executives from three delivery companies told Tech in Asia on condition of anonymity.Some of the overhead costs that online grocers incur include procurement, packaging, rent, and maintenance for dark stores as well as compensation for store and delivery staff.Quick commerce firms buy products in bulk directly from manufacturers and suppliers, while saving on rent because their hubs are small and do not need to be at prime locations.Zepto selects micromarkets based on factors like the density of consumer demand, road patterns, traffic data, last-mile supply availability, and real estate prices. It builds its own datasets and models to do this.Online grocers also maintain tight control over inventory to minimize waste and don’t employ staff to assist consumers in person or help them check out.An order is typically dispatched from Zepto’s dark stores within 58 seconds, co-founder Aadit Palicha tells Tech in Asia.“If you have an efficient internal process, your outflow can be much faster than a traditional retail store or a traditional ecommerce warehouse,” he adds.A model only for metros“The concept of 10-minute deliveries is not valid for small towns in India. Meanwhile, consumers in top cities are time-poor and have a certain amount of disposable income,” says Orios Ventures’ Jain.Photo credit: ZeptoHe adds that consumers in high-end neighborhoods may be willing to pay a delivery fee. However, a mid-sized grocery store may be better suited to serve low-to-middle income localities.“I’m bullish on the quick commerce model from a Tier 1 city perspective,” says Akshay Bhushan, partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners. The VC firm also backs Astro, a quick commerce firm based in Indonesia.He also believes ‌hyperfast deliveries are likely to succeed in ‌local and mature markets, where the consumer demand is high.“I’d say there’s a very clear product-market fit for higher income consumers, but I think the proposition has to be modified for other consumer segments,” Bhushan adds.Challenges to speedy deliveryConsumers’ consumption patterns will change if inventory at dark stores is not constantly stocked and updated based on varying needs, another industry expert explains.The expert adds that a consumer may prefer to shop at traditional stores if they struggle to find everything they need on a single platform, disregarding the shorter waiting time.Photo credit: More RetailMeanwhile, Hanchens’ Dewan says the biggest challenge for quick commerce isn’t operations but mindset. For instance, when consumers are used to paying a specific price for delivery, they might not accept a hike.“When it comes to the cost of delivery, online delivery firms should not be penny-wise and pound-foolish,” Dewan added. “A delivery fee is eventually going to make its way to users.”Meanwhile, the short delivery windows in quick commerce also put a lot of pressure on delivery staff, who have to navigate India’s pothole-riddled roads, where cattle and other animals regularly stray into traffic.Last year, the World Bank said that India’s roads saw one death every four minutes, while road accidents kill about 150,000 people in the countryeach year.Tech in Asia spoke with eight delivery personnel who work for online grocers in India. They said they were constantly under ‌pressure to rush their orders, highlighting the dark side of the country’s gig economy.Photo credit: Swiggy“I’ve had to deal with angry customers who had complained of a two-minute delay, and they don’t accept any justification from my end,” a delivery person told Tech in Asia on condition of anonymity. “I’ve had some of my worst days when an order has been dispatched with incorrect items in them.”However, Zepto told Tech in Asia that it offers no incentives on deliveries under 10 minutes. It also doesn’t penalize those that take longer than that.Some delivery riders say they prefer working with Zepto and Blinkit as the firms give them many orders from specific locations, making it easier on their pockets.“Our riders are not (dis)incentivized to deliver fast. They do it at their own pace and rhythm,” Blinkit’s Dhindsa said in a Twitter post last year. “We’ve had zero reported rider accidents in the last two months since we launched 10-minute grocery delivery.”However, Tech in Asia has viewed a WhatsApp group where delivery personnel – including those from Zepto and Blinkit – regularly air their grievances. Troubles such as minor accidents, charging a penalty against consumer complaints, and pressure from immediate bosses at dark stores were brought up in their conversations.“I’m fed up with the constant complaints from my store manager,” one of the delivery staff said on the WhatsApp group. “What can I do about roadblocks, which make me take longer routes?”Despite the challenges that face delivery staff, a surge in demand for quick commerce has pushed investors to stay committed to the emerging model.The road ahead“I will not be surprised if we see another 1,000-plus investments happening in the next one to two years into the direct-to-consumer space, which is also enabled by quick commerce players,” says Dewan.After Blinkit hit the US$1 billion valuation mark in 2021, a VC backing an Indian grocery firm also mentions the possibility of a unicorn coming up in the space this year.Photo credit: Blinkit (Grofers)However, India’s quick-delivery firms are also expected to go through cycles of high and low discounting, depending on investor climate.The country’s startup ecosystem has been on a bull run over the past few months, with larger ticket sizesfor investments flowing into these quick commerce firms.“The potential softening of US tech stocks could affect private equity markets, venture capital, and growth-stage investors, affecting quick commerce companies as well,” an Indian VC firm executive tells Tech in Asia.However, the executive adds that there could be further investment into quick commerce companies, with existing players aggressively expanding their operations until their unit economics hit a low point.",The 10-minute delivery is taking India’s ecommerce industry by storm.

From 2014 to 2021, the firms have either led investments or co-invested with regional and international investors across a total of 41 funding rounds, worth US$20.6 billion.However, facing significant regulatory hurdles in the Chinese market, the Alibaba-Tencent rivalry looks likely to spill over into key battlegrounds abroad.Rivalry heats up?: While previous analysis found the two competing for investments in only the fintech sector, Tencent entered ecommerce with three investments in late 2021: Singapore-based collectibles e-tailer Mighty Jaxx, Philippine B2B platform Growsari, and Indonesian ecommerce marketplace Ula.Drawing battle lines: Tighter financial regulations from Beijing could also limit room for growth in fintech, forcing Tencent and Alibaba to eventually compete in other industries. “Fintech is a growing area, but it’s harder to get market share, as many governments would like to control domestic financial flows,” said Andrew Collier, Orient Capital Research’s managing director.Open to risk: While the two companies preferred late-stage and strategic investments before 2020, Tencent is now looking at backing more fledgling firms. Cumulatively, a little over 77% of all funding rounds that both companies participated in from 2014 to 2019 were late-stage or strategic investments. That figure fell to 58% after 2020.Read more: Alibaba, Tencent’s SEA investment spree in 2021Startup spotlightPeeking into DarwinboxDarwinbox founders Rohit Chennamaneni (left), Chaitanya Peddi (center), and Jayant Paleti.

It is also eyeing the Middle East and Japan as potential opportunities. “Suddenly, there was a lot more interest among companies to look at HR technology to automate their activities,” Darwinbox co-founder Rohit Chennamaneni told Tech in Asia.Key insights: Chennamaneni said that the system could notice employees’ level of engagement based on multiple touchpoints, allowing stakeholders to take actions guided by data.

But the recent investment serves as a validation of CoLearn’s view on the future of education in post-pandemic Indonesia.“Parents will realize the best combination [for their children’s education] is offline school and online private tutoring. School going back offline will be a positive thing for this industry,” Saboo says.Latecomer’s advantageSaboo co-founded CoLearn with Marc Irawan and Sandeep Devaram in 2020, but the firm’s journey began even before then.In 2018, the company initially started with an offline model, establishing itself as a “smart center” that hired top educators to offer supplementary English, mathematics, and coding classes to students.These centers proved to be successful and became profitable quickly, says Saboo, but scaling such a brick-and-mortar business was a challenge. Going hybrid was one option, but when Covid-19 hit, the decision became an easy one: The company went fully online.The next big decision for the firm would be related to its product offering.CoLearn co-founders Irawan, Devaram, and Saboo / Photo credit: CoLearnAcknowledging that CoLearn was a “latecomer to the party,” Saboo and his co-founders had to be mindful of the existing players in the market. Ruangguru and Zenius, two household names in the K-12 segment, were fighting it out in the recorded content arena, he says, so the company steered clear of that. Instead, the team ventured into other spaces: live classes and AI-powered homework assistance – two areas it now wants to “dominate and own.”However, the country’s edtech incumbents have challenged the company’s ambition, particularly in the live classes space. Both Ruangguru and Zenius have rolled out live-class features over the past year. So has fellow newcomer Pahamify.Despite the increasing competition, Saboo believes his company’s focus will hold it in good stead.“You build specialization in one thing. If you want to specialize in recorded content, you will be needing a very different skill set, hires, approach, pricing points, marketing than live classes – all of that will be completely different. You can’t try to do both. You have to pick which one you want,” he says.Laser-sharp focusWith the social distancing measures put in place all over the world, edtech has been enjoying unprecedented popularity, and a lot of players have tried to capitalize on this by diversifying their offerings to capture a wider user base and cross-sell to existing customers.CoLearn has resisted such temptations.“What we started in March 2020 and what we do now, it’s exactly the same,” says Saboo. “We want speed, but to get speed, we need focus.”The firm’s existing backers – including Sequoia, which selected CoLearn to join its Surge accelerator program in 2020 – support this unique approach. The strategy has also caught the eye of CoLearn’s new investors.“The team’s laser-sharp focus in delivering the best live class experience is quickly gaining the confidence of the students and parents alike. Tanya, their AI-powered problem-solving platform that helps with homework, addresses a key problem and therefore has become an integral part of the lives of students in Indonesia,” says Amy Yeh, senior managing director at KTB Network, which is an early backer of Chinese edtech giant TAL Education.Sequoia Capital is one of CoLearn’s backers / Photo credit: Sequoia CapitalInterestingly, CoLearn’s targeted approach goes beyond its products and features. It has also focused on offering only a handful of subjects, namely mathematics, physics, chemistry, and English, which Saboo describes as “subjects that matter for the future.” In terms of target segment, CoLearn zones in on grades five to 12, and unlike some peers, will not be expanding to the college and professional segment.While the super app strategy has been much celebrated in the region, Saboo says he has strong reasons to believe that sticking to a certain expertise, particularly in the edtech space, can bring big success. One benchmark for CoLearn is China’s Yuanfudao, which became the world’s biggest edtech company in 2020 with a valuation of US$15.5 billion.Yuanfudao’s app concentrates on live tutoring, though it has also rolled out sister apps that help students check math problems and those that have an online Q&amp;A service.Moment to monetizeWhile it’s still early days for CoLearn, Saboo feels the company is moving in the right direction. At the moment, it boasts 4.5 million registered users, with an 80% class attendance rate and over 80% of students seeing an improvement in grades.CoLearn, which currently makes money from its live classes, says 90% of its new users have come organically. Now, with considerable capital at its disposal, the company will look to reach not only more students but also their parents.It plans to double down on its go-to-market and monetization efforts, which some say could be a challenge for edtech companies around the world.Saboo acknowledges the hurdles ahead, but following a few go-to market experiments CoLearn has run, he believes his company is close to cracking the right monetization model and approach.“However, it basically comes down to the product. If you have a good product, Indonesians are willing to pay,” he says.","While product diversification is a common move for startups flush with capital, CoLearn believes sticking to a certain expertise can bring big success.",586001,Ardi Wirdana,True,Putra Muskita and Jaclyn Tiu,0,"['Investments', 'News', 'Premium Content']","['colearn', 'edtech', 'Funding', 'Indonesia']",False,,True,True,True,False,5

Delivered every Wednesday via email and through the Tech in Asia website, this free newsletter breaks down the biggest stories and trends in fintech. If you’re not a subscriber, get access by registering here.Hello there,Over a decade ago, I started my career as a copy editor in New Delhi, India. The job provided me with my first taste of financial independence, and it felt thrilling. However, I was not able to manage my money and ended up spending everything I earned.This was when my roommate suggested that I make a monthly Excel sheet so I could keep tabs on my spending. It actually helped: I was able to cut down on the wasteful expenses and started saving a bit every month from my paltry salary.Little did we know that the idea of documenting our expenses would one day emerge as an important segment of the fintech world.Like India, Indonesia is churning out several startups that record and analyze consumer spending by tracking users’ transactions at major banks and e-wallets.Riding on the success of bookkeeping apps such as BukuKas and BukuWarung, personal finance management apps are drawing the attention of early-stage and angel investors.In this week’s big story, my colleague Ardi explores whether personal ledgers can replicate the success of bookkeeping apps in Indonesia.Almost half of Indonesia’s 270 million population have bank accounts, so the opportunity for money management players is big. But with bigger opportunities comes bigger competition.Read on to find out what it will take for personal finance management apps to make the cut in this burgeoning market.As for me, I’m still using my old-school Excel sheet to track my spending.— SamreenTHE BIG STORYIndonesia’s personal finance apps see new tailwinds – and VC fundingImage credit: Timmy LoenAfter the rise of BukuKas and BukuWarung, some startups are hoping to follow the same trajectory by putting a consumer spin on the two firms’ B2B products.THE HOT TAKECrypto’s wave of MAS disapprovalImage credit: Timmy LoenHere’s what happened:The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has imposed a ban on all advertising of crypto assets to the public in the city-state.This ban covers both online and offline advertisements as well as ads through third parties like social media influencers.Companies can only market on their websites, apps, and social platforms.Here’s our take:While MAS took pains to highlight that it “strongly encourages the development of blockchain technology and innovative application of crypto tokens in value-adding use cases,” it also cited that its decision is based on how the “the trading of cryptocurrencies is highly risky and not suitable for the general public.”This move is part of a global trend. On the same day that MAS made its announcement, Spain unveiled restrictions on advertising of crypto assets. Advertisers and crypto companies are required to inform the country’s fiscal watchdog about the content of upcoming major campaigns and provide warnings about the risks of these investments.Singapore’s approach, however, is notably stricter than Spain’s.As with other businesses, most crypto companies don’t set up shop in Singapore to access its domestic market. However, this decision may encourage a further shift away from the previous perception that the city-state was a friendly jurisdiction for crypto players.On the flipside, crypto advertising does need to be controlled, given that many retail investors aren’t ready for the volatility of these digital assets. Also, the MAS directive doesn’t forbid crypto platforms from advertising on their own social media page – a curious loophole.Photo credit: Thought Catalog / UnsplashWhat about the outlook for crypto in the rest of Southeast Asia? On the one hand, Singapore is often at the vanguard of regulatory trends in the region. Governments in some countries may decide to follow MAS and implement similar bans. This would have a significant impact in a country like Indonesia, where the retail market is far larger and the advertising of crypto assets has been rampant.On the other hand, some governments may spy an opportunity to overtake Singapore in a fast-growing area of finance.

However, they want to target a markedly different segment: the country’s banked and underbanked consumers.An Indonesian consumer using Finku’s expense tracker feature / Photo credit: Tech in AsiaAs is the case with their MSME-focused cousins, these expense tracker apps – or commonly referred to as personal finance management (PFM) platforms – are free to download and use, which could open the door for massive adoption. But whether they can reach the scale of the likes of BukuKas and BukuWarung is open for debate.One co-founder of an MSME-focused bookkeeping startup in Indonesia, however, believes it could happen.“They can grow as big, or even bigger, because a lot of consumers are already online due to Covid-19,” says the person, who asked to remain anonymous.He has so much confidence in the industry that the co-founder has even backed one player in the space.And he is not the only one who is optimistic: PFM startups have gained the interest of plenty of angel and early-stage investors.Jakarta-based Sribuu, for example, has received backing from Beenext, as well as from founders of Indonesian startups such as Ayoconnect, Fabelio, Kopi Kenangan, and Kudo. Another startup, Finku, raised funding from Global Founders Capital and 500 Startups last year. Both companies have also been accepted into Y Combinator this year.Homegrown digital ledger firm Moni, meanwhile, secured funding from VC firm Init 6, and Pina, a personal finance app with an expense tracker feature (also inducted into Y Combinator), has received backing from 1982 Ventures, Prasetia Dwidharma, Oberyn Capital, and iSeed Asia.Other similar companies on the VC radar include Moneyhub and Midas Financials.Timely reemergencePFM apps allow users to record and analyze their spending by tracking the transactions they’ve made at major banks and e-wallets like GoPay and Ovo. This is done either manually or automatically (through system integrations).Interestingly, the recent crop of PFM startups aren’t the first to enter the field, but their predecessors have not exactly done great.Among the pioneers in this field was Jojonomic. The company entered the market as a personal bookkeeping app in 2014, raised seed funding from East Ventures a year later, but pivoted into HR solutions in 2016.A marketing image by Jojonomic before its pivot into HR solutions / Photo credit: JojonomicAnother early mover was Finansialku. While the company is still operational and remains a household name in personal finance, it has not received any VC funding in almost a decade of business.This not-so-remarkable history is something the new wave of PFM founders is well aware of. But they believe that timing and market readiness is key to overcoming past challenges.“We see that this industry has come a long way since the early Jojonomic period,” says Moni co-founder and CEO Ahmad Faiz Nasshor.Back then, he reasons, ecommerce transactions and e-wallet usage were nowhere near today’s levels, making it difficult to automatically track expenses. Additionally, there has also been a notable jump in financial literacy among Indonesians.Finansialku itself confirms this shift. “The market is very different to the one years ago. People are more educated about financial planning, and the financial industry has grown also. Demand [for bookkeeping tools] has grown a lot,” says the firm’s co-founder and CEO, Melvin Mumpuni.Brazil and Korea are two markets that have shown how effective PFM platforms can be, according to Finku co-founder and co-CEO Shyam Kalairajah. Brazil’s GuiaBolso amassed around 6 million users before it was acquired by Latin American digital wallet PicPay last year. Meanwhile, South Korean mobile financial app Toss raised a US$410 million funding round last year, which valued the company at US$7.4 billion.Crowded cornerWith almost half of Indonesia’s 270 million population now having bank accounts, the opportunity for PFM players is huge. To add to that, more of the nation’s unbanked citizens now have access to e-wallets like GoPay and Ovo.This makes consumer neobanks an enticing segment for many companies, says the co-founder of the MSME-focused startup quoted previously. The problem for PFM firms is that there are already existing players who have a head start.“For the consumer side, you can even count the likes of Gojek, Grab, Tokopedia, Shopee who are all there already. It would not take them much effort to launch a PFM feature,” he adds, though he also contends that it may be difficult for “big companies” to execute well.Other startups that appear to be entering the PFM space from an adjacent vertical are peer-to-peer transfer companies Flip and Oy.But a bigger group seems to be the wave of digital banks coming into the market, says Hans de Back, a managing partner at fintech-focused VC firm Finch Capital.Indeed, a host of digital banks in Indonesia, many of which are backed by some of the country’s top tech companies, have expense tracker tools as a built-in feature. GoTo-backed Bank Jago, for example, claims its bookkeeping feature is “supported by machine learning capabilities that are constantly being developed.”Photo credit: Bank JagoHowever, digital banks typically only track transactions flowing through accounts within their own bank, which makes it perhaps less ideal for people that store money in several bank accounts and e-wallets.This is something PFM players boast as their key advantage. In fact, connectivity and integration with various providers is an area of competition for these firms.Finku claims that it currently is “by a long way” the player with the most integrations. The company says it offers 23 integrations, which they describe as “proprietary connections.”However, one concern surrounding this is security. At the moment, all the players in the market are registered with the country’s communications and information technology ministry, but only Finansialku is registered with the Otoritas Jasa Keuangan (OJK), Indonesia’s financial services authority.Meanwhile, carrying out API integrations with banks would typically also require a license from the country’s central bank.There is a way to navigate around the license requirement, one industry insider tells Tech in Asia, and that’s by using a less costly process called screen scraping. This enables third parties to log in to a bank customer’s internet banking profile and copy transactional information to support their service (though there have been concerns about the security of this).Mulling monetizationWinners in this space will be those that offer best-in-class connectivity and usability, says Finch Capital’s de Back. Those that succeed could reach the heights of heavily funded MSME-focused bookkeeping startups. However, de Back expects these PFM platforms will face the same challenge: making money.“If PFM players could grow their user base very fast and have high retention, they might be able to raise subsequent rounds, but at the end of the day, you need a clear business model with good unit economics,” he says.With the exception of Finansialku, which charges a 35,000 rupiah (US$2.43) per month subscription fee for its products, all of the local PFM players currently offer their tool free of charge. Some even promise to keep it free forever.The interface of personal finance app Moni / Photo credit: MoniMoni’s Nasshor concedes that monetization is the main challenge in the industry, but he says the firm has started exploring ways to monetize. One of these monetization methods is creating a premium product with exclusive features, such as display customization and shared access for families.“However, relying on premium features will not be enough. Therefore, players in this industry need to be observant in spotting the [monetization] opportunities that can be offered that can provide additional value to users,” says Nasshor.Likewise, Finku’s Kalairajah says that the company has already added functionalities such as its insights feature, where users see financial products that are tailored for them. The company, which currently has 200,000 users, looks to add more features and monetize them in the future.However, if the likes of BukuKas and BukuWarung are anything to go by, players may not need to be in a rush to start monetizing.Both companies only started monetizing their services in their third year of operations, after raising well over US$50 million worth of funding. Having focused their efforts on growing their merchant base, the two companies are now looking to reap the rewards by earning through newly introduced financial services such as lending, savings, and insurance for MSMEs.An SME merchant showing the BukuWarung app on his mobile phone / Photo credit: East VenturesPersonal finance management apps have the potential to enjoy the same trajectory, but only if they laser in on equally painful and similarly enormous consumer use cases, says Justin Hall, a partner at Golden Gate Ventures which is a backer of BukuWarung.It’s clear that there will be a lot of competition in this space, and inevitably, some players will lose out.“The barriers to entry might be lower for PFM companies, and the winners will be those companies that expand and own their own financial flywheel,” says Hall.","After the rise of BukuKas and BukuWarung, some startups are hoping to follow the same trajectory by putting a consumer spin on the two firms’ B2B product.",586001,Ardi Wirdana,True,Putra Muskita and Jaclyn Tiu,0,"['Fintech', 'Premium Content']","['Finch Capital', 'finku', 'Golden Gate Ventures', 'Moni', 'sribuu']",False,,True,True,True,False,7

I’ve also learned about other accelerators out there who are building on the model that YC created.

It’s aimed at helping the young startups that are tackling the problems that the Indian market and the Indian diaspora currently face.It starts with an idea: With this fund, 9Unicorns is mostly focused on idea-stage startups, but it’ll also look for opportunities in late-stage companies as well.Quintuple it: This US$500 million fund would be 5x larger than 9Unicorns’ first fund, whose corpus stands at US$100 million. 9Unicorns is currently making investments from its initial fund and has firms such as Vedantu, Shiprocket, Melorra, Klub, GOQii, Chingari, and ReshaMandi in its portfolio.Similar, but different: Besides providing funding, 9Unicorns also offers 90 hours of mentorship over three months and across 40 sessions to startups in its portfolio.

729859,2022-01-25T05:00:16,2022-01-27T06:42:00,Behind Ula’s entry into social commerce,teman-ula-social-commerce,post,"When Nipun Mehra arrived in Indonesia and saw how mom and pop stores (warungs) worked in the country, he was reminded of his time growing up in Delhi’s busy market area.In both countries, merchants often operate out of their own homes and become anchors for social interactions in their neighborhoods.That’s why, according to Mehra, who is the co-founder of Indonesia-based B2B marketplace Ula, it was a natural journey when the company launched its social commerce feature in June last year.“In Indonesia, commerce has always been social. Yes, social can mean Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp, but social also means relationships,” he tells Tech in Asia.Ula co-founders Nipun Mehra / Photo credit: UlaCalled Teman Ula, the new feature that means “Ula’s friends” in English, is a service that allows small neighborhood retailers in the firm’s ecosystem to offer more products than what they usually provide to customers.For example, a warung that only sells cigarettes can start to aggregate demand from its customers for oil, chicken, and other products. The order will be delivered to the warungin the same way that the cigarettes are usually delivered.In the last six months, Teman Ula’s registered users have grown 20x. Its number of transactions are now at around 70,000 orders per month.“Our target is to make Teman Ula’s contribution to our business reach 40% in the next 18 months,” Mehra says.While that’s a very ambitious target, the co-founder believes it’s achievable – the company saw 80% of Teman Ula’s users make a repeat transaction in the following month. Some of the users even made up to 14 orders in a single 30-day time period.More offerings equal more incomeUla was founded in 2018 to improve how neighborhood stores run their businesses. The company made headlines when it raised a US$110 million series B round in November last year from prominent investors such as Tiger Global, Tencent, and Bezos Expeditions, the investment firm of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.The firm’s first offering was a solution that aimed to help warung owners source goods. Then it complemented the service with a credit product that let merchants to buy products and pay for them later. Currently, Ula provides the service itself, but in the future, it may collaborate with other financial institutions.However, the company saw another problem:Warungowners usually only focus on selling specific products to limit the need for storage space and to minimize waste. But this meant that merchants weren’t able to fulfill all of their customers’ demands.“Sometimes, people need to buy several items – from toothpaste, shampoo, garlic, to chicken. And if the merchant doesn’t have some of those items, [customers] will go to another place,” Mehra says.Teman Ula members / Photo credit: UlaThis is how he came up with the concept of Teman Ula. Previously,warung owners could only sell dozens of products that they usually stock. With social commerce, they can now sell thousands of items, without the need to buy them in advance or provide more space to store them. In this way, merchants are able to increase their revenue without changing their outlets.“Retail in Indonesia will always be traditional retail. It’s not just about economics, but it’s also a culture,” Mehra explains. “That’s why I believe that while the way they do business may be changed, but the basic culture will be the same.”See also: Bezos-backed Ula’s winning combo may be commerce and creditWhile the prime users of Teman Ula are the warung owners already in its system, the service can also be used by individuals who don’t have any space to build outlets or are just at the start of their entrepreneurial journey.One example is Virgo. The former credit analyst, who only goes by one name, was laid off from his previous job and used his employment benefits to start a business. He used Teman Ula to get information on the products that he could offer to his neighborhood and started by selling several items, before continuing to sell more products as demand grew.Teman Ula wasn’t the first channel he explored. Initially, the entrepreneur tried to find grocery suppliers by himself, but he was scammed when the so-called suppliers ran away with his money.What happened to Virgo is not a unique case in Indonesia, as information on trusted distributors is still limited, especially in rural areas. Sumini, another Teman Ula user who also goes by one name, started her business by losing around US$7,000 of her money to a fake supplier.Piggybacking on the existing supply chainAccording to Mehra, Ula doesn’t need to build many things to get Teman Ula off the ground, as the social commerce feature is just an extension of the main business. Both operations even use the same warehouse, logistics, procurement, and technology infrastructures.“The delivery guy who drops orders for Teman Ula is also the same guy who drops stuff for warungs in the wet market,” Mehra explains.Because of that, he isn’t afraid of competition from other players, especially those who don’t start with a supply chain business like Ula.For instance, the company’s current infrastructure allows it to deliver packages at the exact time when warung owners want them. On-time delivery, Mehra says, is a very important aspect of the business, as it helps keep end customers loyal to merchants.Fadilah, one of Teman Ula users / Photo credit: UlaThe only difference between Teman Ula and Ula’s B2B commerce business is that the process for Teman Ula doesn’t end when merchants receive an order. That’s why while the social commerce feature is on the Ula app, it has additional functionalities like customer order tracking.The difference between Teman Ula and traditional ecommerce transactions, on the other hand, is the necessity to meet a minimum order requirement before an order can be fulfilled. Mehra explains that this was necessary because Ula was set up to work for bulk deliveries.This isn’t a big problem, he says, because the company often works withwarungowners anyway. If the demand for an order is still below the minimum requirement of several hundred thousand rupiahs, sellers can add products that they can sell in their warungs.See also: Behind Ula’s striking takeoff in IndonesiaCurrently, Teman Ula is available in East Java, where the company started its operations and where its infrastructure is mature.On top of that, East Java is a region with a high enough gross domestic product, with a less dense demographic. Thus, neighborhood warungsare usually located quite far from the nearest distributor, making Ula’s service more beneficial for them.However, the company aims to expand Teman Ula to Central Java and West Java in the near future.Mehra predicts that commerce in Indonesia will become more on-demand, where customers can order what they want through channels that they prefer.“There are startups who work on aggregating supply from farmers, and there are startups like Teman Ula that are aggregating demand from customers. If we collaborate together, it’s a good thing for the country and ecosystem.”","Jeff Bezos-backed Ula said that the number of transactions for its social commerce feature, Teman Ula, are now at around 70,000 orders per month.",86192,Aditya Hadi Pratama,True,Collin Furtado and Jaclyn Tiu,0,"['Ecommerce', 'News', 'Premium Content', 'Startups']","['Ecommerce', 'Indonesia', 'Indonesia social commerce', 'Nipun Mehra', 'Social Commerce', 'teman ula', 'ula', 'warungs']",False,,True,True,True,False,5

We break down the big and messy topics of Asia’s tech and startup community. Get the newsletter in your inbox everyday with a Premium subscription.Hello reader,People are often quick to question a startup that cashes out early, especially if ‌growth momentum is on its side. The underlying assumption is that fast-growing startups tend to be rewarded with lofty valuations.While there is some merit to this argument, a peek beneath the surface will likely show that there is more to an exit than meets the eye. Supercharged growth doesn’t always guarantee massive profits, or even profitability.Google’s acquisition of YouTube for US$1.7 billion in 2006 is an ideal example of a win-win situation through an early exit. It resulted in YouTube’s founders receiving a jaw-dropping payday and Google making the video-sharing platform an internet staple. YouTube raked in nearly US$20 billion in revenue for fiscal year 2020 alone, and that figure is only expected to grow.Everything turned out rosy for all parties involved, but it could’ve easily gone downhill had the deal fallen through. YouTube was less than two years old at the time and was burning through cash quickly. There is a strong argument that the second largest search engine would’ve gone out of business without Google’s deep pockets.Sometimes, the benefits that an exit through a merger offers are simply too great to turn down for a startup. Following this reasoning, we break down why AI-powered marketing platform Saleswhale opted for a successful exit through US-based unicorn 6Sense instead of going for its series B round.Today we look at,Why Saleswhale sold its business to this SoftBank-backed unicornSouth Korea-based Greenlabs nearing unicorn status after its latest funding round Other newsy highlights such as SPAC fever hitting Singapore and a webtoon developer’s mammoth funding roundPremium summaryA leviathan lurking in the SaaS oceanImage credit: Timmy LoenSaleswhale became the first Y Combinator-backed company in Singapore to be acquired after it agreed to a cash and stock deal with 6Sense. The acquisition follows the recent trend of consolidation in the global software-as-a-service (SaaS) market.Interestingly, this deal is also the latest in the line of successful exits by Singapore-based SaaS companies. It comes after Stamped’s US$110 million acquisition by WeCommerce last year and Intuit’s US$80 million buyout of TradeGecko in 2020.The time was ripe: Saleswhale co-founder Gabriel Lim didn’t disclose the exact value of the deal, but he told Tech in Asia that the amount is in the low to mid-eight figure range in US dollars. The deal comes after 6Sense secured US$200 million in a series E fundraise, pushing its valuation to US$5.5 billion.Tough decisions: At the height of the pandemic in 2020, Saleswhale’s revenues plunged by 70% to US$300,000 as its clients across the world implemented cost cuts. The company also went through two rounds of layoffs from March to September 2020. Its workforce – 38 employees across commercial, sales customer success, engineering, and design teams – was slashed by half.It was meant to be: Interestingly, Saleswhale and 6Sense had built a product map to include their own versions of each others’ products in their portfolio, confirming the product-market fit for the deal. “Selling my business was like a protective parent watching my baby grow up and enter the real world,” noted Lim.Read more: Why Saleswhale sold its business to this SoftBank-backed unicornStartup spotlightHarvesting a unicorn: nearing completionPhoto credit:  Sompong Sriphet / 123rfSouth Korea-based Greenlabs is inching closer toward achieving ‌unicorn status after it raised US$140 million in a series C round at a valuation of nearly US$900 million. BRV Capital Management, Skylake Incuvest, and SK Square led the round.Founded in 2017 by Scott Sungwoo Choi, Charlie Sanghoon Shin, and Luke Donghyun Ahn, Greenlabs aims to give farmers better control over their fresh produce and connect enterprise customers to reliable sourcing channels.Confidence is high: Greenlabs has tapped into Korea’s digital agriculture market, and it is “well poised to become a unicorn” just five years after it was established, according to Shin. The company has raised a total of US$170 million to date.Charting a course away from home: Greenlabs will use the fresh capital to expedite its global expansion plans, having already set up shop in China and Vietnam. It’s also looking to enter new markets through partnerships with local players.Tap to track the harvest: One of the agritech startup’s services is Farm Morning, a smart system that gives farmers insights into their crop lifecycle. This system has an app that serves more than 500,000 farmers. Greenlabs also runs Sinsun Market, a B2B marketplace that specializes in fresh produce.Quick bytes1️⃣ SPAC fever hits SingaporeVertex Technology Acquisition Corp, the first special purpose acquisition company out of Singapore, saw its share price climb as much as 5% in its first day of trading, signaling investor demand.

729755,2022-01-24T05:00:14,2022-01-24T12:51:26,"Alibaba, Tencent’s SEA investment spree in 2021",alibaba-tencents-sea-investment-spree-2021,visual-story,"Amid intensifying regulatory headwinds in China, Alibaba and Tencent, the country’s two biggest tech giants, have accelerated their investments in key battlegrounds abroad.Southeast Asia, in particular, gained significant attention from both firms in 2021. The two companies were early investors in the region’s ecommerce scene, but their presence is now felt across even more industries.As the Alibaba-Tencent rivalry heats up in Southeast Asia, new alliances are being forged, and more industries in the region are set to be disrupted.Tencent’s year-long shopping spreeIn 2021, both Alibaba and Tencent expanded their footprint in Southeast Asia.In mid-December last year, Alibaba laid bare its plans to grow Lazada’s gross merchandise value fivefold to US$100 billion by 2030.But while the Chinese ecommerce titan focused on its existing investments, Tencent grew its regional portfolio instead.Globally, the Chinese gaming giant racked up 34 investments in just the first half of 2021 – 11x more than the same period two years ago.In terms of industries, Tencent also appears to have a broader investment mandate than Alibaba. That’s unsurprising, given that Tencent has placed its bets on a wider range of industries in the past.Tencent’s regional portfolio includes firms in industries like logistics and transportation, which are not integral to its core online entertainment business. This stands in stark contrast from its domestic strategy, which centers on investments in artificial intelligence and mobile app startups.What the firm’s regional moves hint at is the growing importance of Southeast Asia in the global supply chain, particularly as a “way station” between China and the US, says Orient Capital Research managing director Andrew Collier. Over the last decade, Collier has closely observed economic and financial trends in China.The data on last year’s investments also suggests that Tencent is overlapping more with Alibaba. While our previous analysis found competing investments in only the fintech sector, Tencent entered into ecommerce with three investments in late 2021: Singapore-based collectibles e-tailer Mighty Jaxx, Philippine B2B platform Growsari, and Indonesian ecommerce marketplace Ula.Tighter financial regulations could also limit room for growth in fintech, forcing Tencent and Alibaba to eventually compete in other industries.“Fintech is a growing area, but it’s harder to get market share, as many governments would like to control domestic financial flows,” shares Collier.Befriending investorsIt’s too early to tell if Southeast Asia’s startups will have to take sides in the Alibaba-Tencent rivalry, but the immediate impact of the increasing investments from the two firms could be beneficial for the region’s startup ecosystem.Between 2014 to 2021, both firms have either led investments or co-invested with regional and international investors across a total of 41 funding rounds worth US$20.6 billion.While the two companies preferred late-stage and strategic investments prior to 2020, Tencent is increasingly looking at backing more fledgling firms.Cumulatively, a little over 77% of all funding rounds that both companies participated in from 2014 to 2019 were late-stage or strategic investments. That figure falls to 58% after 2020.Will the rush into Southeast Asia last?But even as Alibaba and Tencent up their stakes in the region, other concerns could complicate their jostle for Southeast Asia.For one, Beijing’s ongoing crackdown could encroach on the foreign holdings of local firms, swooping down on investments that are at risk of leaking data to foreign governments. Allegedly, the fear that this would happen caused TikTok parent ByteDance to withhold plans for a US IPO last year.Read also: China to ban route used by tech firms for overseas IPOsIndia’s decision to tighten its policy on foreign direct investment from any country it shares a land border – which partly drove Chinese investments toward Southeast Asia – may also be reversed soon.According to Bloomberg, the proposal to loosen restrictions could be approved “as early as next month.”On the other hand, Southeast Asia’s relatively untapped potential could persuade Tencent and Alibaba to invest even more, especially after their divestments, which flushed their coffers with cash.There would be sizable implications should the two Chinese firms strengthen their toehold in the area: Grab might have to worry about GoTo, which has Alibaba and Tencent as shareholders. And with a distracted Shopee fighting ecommerce wars on many fronts, Alibaba might exploit the opportunity by doubling down on Lazada.Given how nascent Southeast Asia’s startup scene is, it seems there’s still room for a dramatic shake-up.CreditsData: Queena WadyantiEditing: Jaclyn Tiu and Terence Lee","Tencent joined 3x more funding rounds in 2021 than 2020, and the company and its rival Alibaba are increasingly playing ball with investors in SEA.",530158,Tay Tian Wen,True,Terence Lee and Jaclyn Tiu ,0,"['Premium Content', 'Visual Stories']","['Alibaba', 'Chinese firms', 'Chinese tech giants', 'investments', 'Southeast Asia', 'Tencent']",False,,True,True,True,False,3

Of course, the deal isn’t final yet, but could this solve UangTeman’s problems?Its ex-employees, however, are not keen to stick around and find out. This isn’t the first time they’ve heard of a potential acquisition, and they’ve already requested an audience with Indonesia’s financial services authority. Meanwhile, UangTeman continues to push back its timeline for settling unpaid salaries, taxes, and social security.Here’s the dilemma: The company needs employees to cooperate if it wants to close the acquisition, especially as it seeks to extend its lending license.

729208,2022-01-21T05:25:24,2022-01-21T05:25:24,The impact of Tencent’s share divestments,impact-tencents-share-divestments,post,"Tencent has an impressive venture portfolio that consists of companies like Tesla, Nio, Didi, GoTo, JD.com, Meituan, Sea, Pinduoduo, Snap, Reddit, Kuaishou, Bilibili, Futu, and more. However, Tencent’s actual value and the extent of its holdings aren’t clear because the company doesn’t disclose these details.One thing for sure is that the company’s portfolio value has declined significantly due to the regulatory clampdowns in China.Photo credit: TencentOver the last month, Tencent has made several surprise moves: It divested its stake in JD.com and pared down its stake in Sea Group. Following this trajectory, Tencent could be unwinding more investments in the future.Here are some guesses what those might be.Tencent’s decisionsIn December, Tencent announced it was divesting shares in JD.com, which caused the Chinese ecommerce firm’s share price to tank. A few weeks ago, Tencent sold US$3 billion worth of shares in Southeast Asian internet giant Sea Group at US$208 each. As a result, Sea’s share price dropped 11.4% to US$197.84 at the time.After the sale, Tencent’s stake in Sea dropped from 21.3% to 18.7%. Tencent will also be restricted from selling Sea shares over the next six months.However, I believe the divestment will continue, adding more selling pressure to Sea shares.This means that Tencent can potentially raise another US$20.5 billion if it eventually divests its entire Sea stock at the internet company’s present market capitalization.With the current US$3 billion sale in Sea and US$16 billion sale in JD, Tencent is sitting on US$19 billion in cash. As of June 30, 2021, Tencent had US$38.8 billion in cash and deposits, so the two share sales are a significant cash injection for the company.Future choicesWhy is Tencent doing this? The company has invested in several startups and has built up an impressive venture portfolio. I think this is due to the ongoing regulatory pressure in China and because Tencent’s stakes in numerous successful enterprises in the country are seen as anti-competitive.If my theory proves true, then Tencent will have to unwind more investments in the coming months. The next likely candidate would be Pinduoduo since it is also an ecommerce player like JD and Sea. Tencent has a 15.6% stake in Pinduoduo, so a complete divestment at a share price of US$49.82 apiece would raise US$9.8 billion for the Chinese tech titan.After Pinduoduo, the next target would be Meituan, another major platform player in China. Tencent has a 17.2% stake in Meituan, which would be worth US$27.1 billion at the time of writing.Once Tencent divests shares in its ecommerce bets, the next group would be the online streaming platforms. Kuaishou would be the first on the chopping block: Tencent has a 17.8% stake in the video-sharing app worth about US$6.4 billion.Next on the list would be Huya and Douyu, whose merger was blocked by the government in July 2021. Tencent owns 47.2% and 37.21% in Huya and Douyu, respectively. The combined value unlocked from a possible divestment would be just US$1 billion.Of course, we shouldn’t forget about Bilibili, where Tencent has a 12.3% stake. That would raise anotherUS$1.8 billion.There are even more investments that Tencent may be “forced” to divest eventually, but I think these are the major ones that would prevent it landing in hot water for anti-monopolistic behavior.Uncertain effectsThe impact of Tencent’s divestments so far is a mixed bag. The positive thing is that the company is unlocking its massive venture portfolio and realizing the gains. By divesting its shares in all the firms mentioned above, we are looking at a total of US$86 billion in cash going into Tencent’s pocket. That’s 10% of its market cap today or 35% of its total assets.Depending on how Tencent books these investments in the statements, there could be a substantial gain in its earnings and book value.The negative side is that it’s selling these investments at much lower prices than before the regulatory clampdown started. Tencent could have waited for a better time to realize these gains. More importantly, it would lose influence in the “consortium” of companies that it has built up over the years.And what would it even do with the US$86 billion in cash if further investments would draw attention to more anti-monopolistic behavior?I suppose a huge special dividend may be looming for Tencent shareholders, and that could give some respite from its current depressed share price.Instead of growing organically, Tencent has been taking a venture approach, investing in companies that operate in specific business segments rather than competing against them with its own venture.That’s why I believe this divestment exercise is counterintuitive to the firm’s key corporate strategy, and Tencent may lose its competitiveness in some segments should the selling continue.","Tencent offloaded its shares in both JD.com and Sea Group over the last month, and it could unwind more investments in the future.",277379,Alvin Chow,False,Jaclyn Tiu and Eileen C.

727512,2022-01-21T02:00:27,2022-02-03T07:44:52,How this company took its DevOps capabilities to the next level,company-devops-capabilities-level,post,"“It’s not my machines, it’s your code!” “It’s not my code, it’s your machines!”This was the argument between John Allspaw and Paul Hammond, two Flickr employees who gave a presentation on cooperation between development and operations at the O’Reilly Velocity Conference 12 years ago. These arguments encapsulated the divide between tech developers and infrastructure operations teams, which caused issues such as slow deployment times and difficulties in problem solving.The need for companies to iron out these issues eventually gave rise to DevOps – an approach to the delivery of IT services that tries to bridge the gap between software development and IT operations. With this, companies could smooth out internal workflows and improve efficiency with potentially staggering results: organizations proficient at DevOps can deploy new code up to 973x more frequently and recover from IT-related incidents up to 6570x faster.One company that knows the importance of DevOps is Hyphen Group, a leading fintech company in Greater Southeast Asia. The firm initially tried beefing up its DevOps capabilities with the help of a central team to help maintain smooth business operations – however, both the engineering and DevOps teams struggled to communicate effectively, which often led to bottlenecks that delayed delivery times.Shannon Murphy, CTO of Hyphen Group / Photo credit: Splunk“We’ve always had a strong engineering culture and ability to code our own infrastructure, but it was more of an enterprise view where infrastructure and operations were separate from engineering,” explains Shannon Murphy, CTO at Hyphen Group.And, as the company accelerated its growth last year by acquiring personal finance community platform Seedly and launching several new products, not having fully-integrated DevOps created some growing pains in maintaining the firm’s IT environment.An overwhelming issueAs the company introduced more code and products, the additional infrastructure made its IT environment more complex. Eventually, it became harder for its developers and infrastructure operations teams to react quickly when problems arose. When major infrastructure outages occurred, it took the company several hours on average to diagnose and fix the problem.While the company initially tried leveraging its existing engineering and DevOps teams to solve such issues, it ended up hurting these employees.“My heads of engineering had to come in at two or three in the morning because they were the ones who knew how to dig through the [error] logs,” Murphy shares. Additionally, employees were stuck doing less meaningful work, focusing on solving these errors.Photo credit: Unsplash“If you’re spending your time troubleshooting problems, then you’re not doing what you love to do,” he adds. “As a result, you’re not delivering the value that you want to the business.”Moreover, having DevOps as a centralized effort meant that its DevOps team became increasingly “overwhelmed” as new products and services were added.“It got to the point where I was pretty sure I was going to lose many of them because it’s just mind-sapping work to sit there and dig through troubleshooting logs, especially when you don’t really know the application that well because you’re not part of the engineering team,” says Murphy.Empowering its teamsTo solve these issues, Hyphen Group had to shore up its DevOps capabilities.It started with decentralizing its DevOps and giving its engineering teams the responsibility to manage it on their own while retaining platform services – such as networking, security, computation, and IT service management – as centralized functions.“[It] moves DevOps to where it means the most: the team that creates the product,” says the chief technology officer. “It creates a much better sense of ownership.”As part of this change, the company also needed to give its engineering and infrastructure operations teams the right tools to succeed. This was when Murphy started to explore potential solutions and connected with Splunk, a data platform that provides observability tools for organizations and DevOps teams.Murphy says he was sold on the platform’s capabilities centering around end-to-end observability – a term in DevOps that refers to the ability to identify and classify oftentimes unexpected errors in complex environments, helping streamline the problem-solving process and allowing both developers and infrastructure operations teams to focus on adding value to the business such as updating existing software or coming up with new products.Murphy highlights how having these observability capabilities came in handy for Hyphen Group’s customers, who experienced isolated errors – such as specific web pages being down – on certain content management platforms. In such cases, businesses might not even realize there were errors on their platform or website for several hours.Photo credit: UnsplashWith Splunk’s Observability Cloud, which provides software solutions to empower observability, Hyphen Group could automatically identify, track, and analyze error reports from these content management platforms. Through this, the firm identified a clear pattern within these error reports and built an automatic script that would resolve similar problems in the future in just under three minutes.Additionally, these tools helped Hyphen Group integrate error monitoring and observability into newly released software updates for existing products and services. This allowed the company to improve the stability of new releases from the get-go, and the firm was able to conduct its last 275 releases automatically, with none of the issues it had experienced before.Similarly, this also allowed the company to improve the stability of new infrastructure and reduce the time needed to deploy it. For instance, Hyphen Group launched its new insurance platform in just 45 days – a process that would have earlier taken it up to a year to complete. Hyphen Group is now looking to capitalize on these improved deployment capabilities to facilitate the more efficient release of new products and services in the future.Clearing the path to successMoving forward, the company is looking to improve its DevOps processes even further through widespread automation, allowing it to achieve better stability, scalability, and security.For this, it will need even greater DevOps observability into the inner workings of its applications, which the firm is working on by modifying its applications to accommodate Splunk’s Observability Cloud even better. In the future, Murphy expects these efforts to pave the way for Hyphen Group’s continual growth.“Where I’m hoping to go with this is understanding system events, business events, and deployment operations in one consistent way, with Splunk providing the infrastructure and application side of that,” he adds. “That is going to be quite awesome and a differentiator for us.”Splunk Observability Cloud is the only full-stack, analytics-powered and OpenTelemetry-native platform which provides a seamlessly integrated user experience, context and workflow across metrics, traces and logs to solve problems in seconds.To find out more about Splunk Observability Cloud, visit its website.This content was produced by Tech in Asia Studios, which connects brands with Asia’s tech community.

The deal adds to the ongoing consolidation in the global software-as-a-service (SaaS) space.Founded in 2015, Singapore-based Saleswhale uses its proprietary AI to write personalized emails, engage in conversations with consumers, and detect when a buyer indicates interest in a product. It serves over 145 teams from mid-market and Fortune 500 companies such as InVision, Sage, LaunchDarkly, Randstad, and Cisco.The Saleswhale team / Photo credit: SaleswhaleMeanwhile, 6Sense helps B2B firms uncover anonymous buying behavior, prioritizes accounts for sales and marketing, and helps firms engage resistant buying teams – or companies that don’t easily get convinced on the sales of a product – with personalized and multichannel campaigns.Lim didn’t disclose the exact value of the cash and stock deal, but he told Tech in Asia that the amount is in the low to mid-eight figure range in US dollars.The deal comes after 6Sense secured US$200 million in a series E fundraise, pushing its valuation to US$5.5 billion. Blue Owl and MSD Partners led the round, which also saw participation from SoftBank Vision Fund 2, Insight Partners, Tiger Global, B Capital Group, and Franklin Templeton.Under the deal, Saleswhale will operate as an independent entity, while Lim will join 6Sense as a product leader. The acquisition will help Saleswhale accelerate product development and focus on the last-mile execution of its sales and marketing product.Saleswhale is the first Y Combinator-backed company in Singapore that has been acquired. However, the AI startup faced several roadblocks on its path to acquisition.A tough sellThe proposal for the acquisition came at a time when Saleswhale was considering seeking funds for its series B round, which was intended to push the company’s growth momentum.A screenshot of the Saleswhale platform / Photo credit: SaleswhaleBut at the height of the pandemic in 2020, Saleswhale’s revenues plunged by 70% to US$300,000 as its clients across the world implemented cost cuts.The company also made reductions to the software it used. It also went through two rounds of layoffs from March to September 2020. Its workforce – 38 employees across commercial, sales customer success, engineering, and design teams – was slashed by half.“2020 was incredibly hard for us, and we were forced to rationalize our cost base,” said Lim.These measures helped Saleswhale bring down the costs it incurred in 2020 by about 50%. The company, however, did not disclose the amount in cost savings from the layoffs.Saleswhale also drafted a roadmap to increase its revenue and turn its fortune around.The comeback kidWhile it lost a chunk of customers amid the pandemic, Saleswhale noted that clients from the B2B segment were still paying for its product.Saleswhale was part of Y Combinator’s 2016 batch. / Photo credit: SaleswhaleAs such, the AI firm set aside resources to build a streamlined product that could serve these industries more efficiently.Saleswhale doubled down on its core product to help clients with the different use cases and offer increased value, which could potentially make them repeat consumers. It also introduced additional features to its product.See also: Singapore may be approaching a golden age for SaaS startups“We taught ourselves to increase the focus on our product and serve our set of customers effectively,” Lim added. Notably, Saleswhale onboarded some of its biggest clients after the onset of the pandemic due to product specialization.The acquisition pushAs its product gained traction in the global market, Saleswhale was approached by 6Sense to discuss an acquisition that could drastically increase its user base and give the combined product a competitive edge compared to existing players.The 6Sense team / Photo credit: 6Sense“Customer conversations are a critical part of our due diligence process, and the feedback from 6sense customers is among the best we’ve heard,” said D1 Capital Partners’ Dan Sundheim in an earlier statement. The executive is the founder of the investment firm, which led 6Sense’s series D round. “Improving revenue results is a goal for every business, but it’s easier said than done,” he added.Interestingly, Saleswhale and 6Sense had built a product map to include their own versions of each others’ products in their portfolio, confirming the product-market fit for the deal.“Selling my business was like a protective parent watching my baby grow up and enter the real world,” noted Lim.Saleswhale said that after the acquisition, it will “aggressively” ramp up hiring for engineers, product designers, and product managers in Singapore and India. The company is looking to double its headcount by the end of this year.Placing Singapore on the global SaaS mapSingapore, which is widely considered a world-class innovation hub, is seeing a number of successful exits by local SaaS companies. Some of them include Stamped’s US$110 million acquisition by WeCommerce last year and US-based software giant Intuit’s reportedly US$80 million buyout of TradeGecko in 2020.The city-state’s attractive tax regime is also a factor, as founders who sell their companies get to keep a bigger chunk of the proceeds.Photo credit: ake1150 / 123RF Global-focused software firms in Singapore benefit from having a lower cost-base and higher margins. They can also rely on top-quality software and engineering talent in the city-state and from other hubs like Vietnam and India.Most software firms target the US because of its sizable and mature population of customers that speak the same language and are willing to adopt new cloud software.

Get the newsletter in your inbox everyday with a Premium subscription.Hello reader,Sometime last year, I had the opportunity to work on an episode of Tech in Asia Explains, which was centered around edtech. It was a fascinating experience to dive into the world of edtech, exploring how technology can completely revolutionize the way we teach and learn.Edtech is certainly here to stay, and I’m keen on seeing how the industry will develop and transform in the years ahead.However, for firms in the space to keep innovating, they need funding. Today, we’re taking a look at the investors that have backed education startups in Southeast Asia.Today we look at,The VC firms investing in Southeast Asia’s edtech startups An HR startup that’s just come out of stealth mode Other newsy highlights such as JD.com and Shopify’s new partnership and Animoca Brands’ latest fundraise Premium summaryBehind the big bucks going into edtechImage credit: Timmy LoenEducation is a rising vertical in Southeast Asia, but who are the investors putting money into the region’s edtech firms? We take a look at the investors who have backed the most edtech startups over the last two years.Eight is great: Topping the list with eight edtech investments in the last 24 months is 500 Startups. The firm invested in companies such as Nas Academy, Pandai, and Conicle, among others.High five: Singapore edtech accelerator EduSpaze and Surge, a scale-up program for startups in India and Southeast Asia, are tied for second place, having invested in five edtech startups each over the last two years. EduSpaze has backed firms like FutureLab and Noodle Factory, while Surge counts Tigerhall and Virtual Internships among its portfolio companies.Third place for this quartet: Four firms sit in third place, having each invested in four edtech startups in Southeast Asia. The four investors are Taurus Ventures, AC Ventures, XA Network, and Shunwei Capital.Read more: Series SEA: Who’s investing in the region’s education startupsStartup spotlightMaking hiring automaticPhoto credit: Van Tay MediaThe process of hiring can be frustrating for everyone involved, whether you’re looking to hire or aiming to get hired. That’s where HR tech firm Kula wants to make a difference – the firm has emerged from stealth mode and has just raised US$2.7 million in a pre-seed round from Venture Highway, Together Fund, and Global Founders Capital.Meeting a need: According to co-founder and CEO Achuthanand Ravi, the inspiration for Kula came from his own struggles during his time at Stripe, where he served on the payment major’s global executive search team. At the time, he and his team had been on the lookout for a tool that could help them solve all the operational parts of the talent engagement process. After failing to find a product that could meet his needs, he decided to build one himself.All in one place: Kula aims to be a streamlined and transparent recruitment automation platform for those that deal with a company’s recruitment process. The startup’s solution brings together all job seeker sources and automates recruitment. With the platform, recruiters can focus more on the candidates that are best suited for certain positions and send out automated follow-ups through several channels.On the right track: The startup is planning for an alpha release of its platform in February this year. For the pilot program, it has also handpicked customers – like Gojek and Wise – across different business stages and geographies to better understand their specific needs.Calling Southeast Asia’s female foundersWhat’s it like being a female founder in Southeast Asia?

Delivered every Thursday via email and through the Tech in Asia website, this free newsletter breaks down the biggest stories and trends in ecommerce. If you’re not a subscriber, get access by registering here.Hi there,As a platinum Grab member, I must confess that the convenience of ride-hailing and food deliveries has gotten the better of me more times than I’d like to admit. But oddly enough, the super app’s GrabMart service just doesn’t sit right with me.Efficiency is high on my hierarchy of virtues, but there’s just something soothing about strolling through aisle after aisle of freshly stocked produce.Maybe that’s one reason why Grab recently acquired Malaysian supermarket chain Jaya Grocer. To demystify the deal, my colleague Emmanuel dug deep into Grab’s evolving business model and discussed how it might fare in an impending showdown of ecommerce giants.This week, we’ll also dive into how non-fungible tokens could revolutionize Southeast Asia’s online-to-offline commerce scene.— Tian WenTHE BIG STORYMaking sense of Grab’s Jaya Grocer acquisitionImage credit: Timmy LoenThe deal marks a seismic shift in Grab’s ecommerce push, but its foray into the grocery space may not be smooth-sailing.THE HOT TAKEWill the metaverse boost online-to-offline retail?Image credit: Timmy LoenHere’s what happened:NFTs issued by brick-and-mortar businesses are selling fast and for record sumsFor Southeast Asia, NFTs could be the missing piece in the O2O commerce puzzleAmid regulatory uncertainty, experiments that pair NFTs with physical goods are still rare in the regionHere’s our take:Nike made headlines in December when it acquired RTFKT, an NFT studio based in the US.RTFKT collaborated with teenage artist Fewocious last year and sold 600 sneaker-NFT pairs in just six minutes.Meanwhile, fashion powerhouse Balenciaga has taken things further via a metaverse tie-up with iconic battle royale game Fortnite. Under the partnership, Fortnite’s millions-strong player base can visit in-game Balenciaga stores. In the real world, the game’s fans can shop real Fortnite-Balenciaga products at a physical outlet of the luxury brand.NFTs could kick O2O commerce up another notch. As the craze over these tokens hits fever pitch in Southeast Asia, retail companies in the region could ride this wave to metaverse riches (or it could be just a fad).The good thing about NFTs is that they can be used to create unique digital experiences that drive real-world customer engagement. Case in point: Mighty Jaxx, a Singapore-based collectibles company, has launched exclusive physical-NFT pairs on marketplaces like OpenSea.The company auctioned off a limited edition “Doge to the Moon: Boss Edition” physical collectible through an NFT launch in November. Mighty Jaxx also ran a 24-hour exclusive on its “The beauty of rebellion” physical collectible seven months earlier. Unlike similar campaigns on ecommerce platforms like Shopee and Alibaba, NFTs confer not only a sense of ownership, but they also provide entry into an exclusive community.For luxury brands, NFTs can serve as an immutable proof of authenticity. High-fashion houses like Burberry and Gucci, for example, are already banking on this capability.Photo credit: gloffs / 123RFBut beyond exclusive physical goods, NFTs can also be instrumental in building O2O commerce ecosystems.From a price-skimming point of view, NFTs let customers pay across a wider range of price levels. They are a step above because unlike non-crypto options, NFTs are “easily sliced and diced into a descending series of price tiers,” says Chris Dixon, general partner at VC firm A16z. That flexibility may be key in introducing NFT-physical product pairs for a range of goods in future.Dixon also suggests that NFTs can reduce customer acquisition costs “to zero” by “making users [into] owners.” Instead of splurging on online advertising or a sales team, companies can mint NFTs and find new customers in the metaverse on a smaller budget. But NFT-minting fees can add up, and the cost benefits might not be fulfilled.Even if customer acquisition costs are reduced, the community that NFTs are issued to could also pose another problem. Balenciaga’s partnership with Fortnite instantly put its merchandise in front of nearly 3 to 4 million daily players, but it’s questionable how well the move converts to actual sales.An image from luxury brand Balenciaga’s collection on Fortnite / Photo credit: Epic Games/ FortniteBut an NFT-driven O2O commerce strategy could really shine in generating revenue from two dimensions at the same time. Games like Fortnite and World of Warcraft have shown that there’s strong demand for accessories that let players express themselves via their in-game or online avatars. The same desire for self-expression can also be found in nearly every aspect of our everyday lives.This is more than simply bundling NFTs with physical products. Companies can offer access to exclusive deals if customers own multiple NFTs or provide discounts on physical goods. Because NFTs are unique and price-flexible, the possibilities are endless.However, there could be limits on how far NFTs could power O2O commerce in Southeast Asia. Countries like Thailand, for instance, have imposed a total ban on NFT trading.Elsewhere, the laws governing NFTs are less clear.Indonesia doesn’t regulate NFTs for now, but the country’s central bank prohibits the use of cryptocurrency in any payment transaction. It’s unclear how that might affect local NFT owners, given that majority of NFTs worldwide are minted on the Ethereum blockchain.There’s also NFT fraud to contend with. Cases like the US$2.7 million Evolved Ape scam and the US$3.4 million Squid Game token scam could not only dampen consumer interest in NFTs but also encourage more stringent regulation of the space.Ultimately, NFTs are still a regulatory gray zone. Can the risks outweigh the rewards? Possibly, if companies can prove the skeptics wrong by showing how NFTs can do what current options cannot. For the region’s O2O contenders, this could be the golden opportunity that they’ve been waiting for.— Tian WenNEWS YOU SHOULD KNOWCheck out Tech in Asia’s coverage of the ecommerce scene here.1️⃣ Vietnam’s Mio has raised US$8 million in series A funding led by Jungle Ventures.

Bringing you this story is my colleague, Tech in Asia journalist Deepti Sri.[SFX: Grab employees cheering]Deepti Sri (VO):No, that’s not a rock concert. That’s a crowd of Grab employees cheering in anticipation for the company’s listing on the Nasdaq.The Singapore-based ride-hailing juggernaut and regional super app went public last month after being valued at roughly US$40 billion when it merged with special purpose acquisition company Altimeter earlier last year. This makes Grab the largest Southeast Asian firm to list in the US.Here’s Tech in Asia editor-in-chief Terence Lee, who was at the bell-ringing ceremony when Grab went public.Terence Lee:So it was, indeed, quite a ceremony. Like, I remember being there at the hotel and, obviously, not everyone could make it to the venue because Grab is such a large company. So they have parties all over the region, right? In various offices and even Singapore, I believe, for the staff that couldn’t make it there. It’s interesting that they also brought in, like, not just the office staff, right? Or the executives? But even, like, your delivery riders, your merchants, they were there as well, as part of the festivities.And you can definitely sense the, I guess, happiness among the longtime staff, you can sense the excitement. And I think when they started the countdown, there’s this, like, tension in the air. Like, yeah, the atmosphere was quite electric, like, you can really sense it.And once the whole ceremony was over, people were just really happy, streaming out, taking photos. People were relieved, they were happy. They were, you know, just hugging each other, just really glad that Grab has sort of achieved this milestone.Deepti Sri (VO):The hype that followed Grab’s listing sent its shares soaring over 19% at a price of US$13.15 apiece within minutes of the bell being rung. However, just as quickly as they climbed, the company’s share prices began to fall. When the market closed at 4:00 pm EST, they’d dipped more than 20% and were trading at US$8.75 per share.While it may seem alarming, this is actually pretty natural for a Southeast Asian company’s listing in the US. Singapore-headquartered Sea Group had a similar experience when it went public in 2016. It only reached the US$100 dollar per stock share milestone in June 2020.However, there are also a number of factors that have contributed to Grab’s fall in share prices. Here’s my colleague, Tech in Asia journalist Aditya Hadi Pratama, on the matter.Aditya Hadi Pratama:I think there are several other factors that supported or contributed to why Grab’s shares fall after the market debut. The first one, I think, is the Omicron variant of the Covid-19 that was spreading. I think because of the new variant, some researchers or some economic expert, I think, estimate the growth in Southeast Asian region will be lower. In September, I think, the Asian Development Bank dropped its 2021 growth forecast for Southeast Asia from 4.4% to 3.1%. So it would hurt the economy of Southeast Asia in general and also Grab’s business, which is primarily in Southeast Asia.The other aspect is the doubt about tech stocks in other remote regions such as Southeast Asia for the institutional or retail investors in the United States because we’re aware that Southeast Asia is not a region that they… they don’t hear news about Southeast Asia on a daily basis. It’s different with, maybe, companies that are based in the United States, so it’s understandable.Deepti Sri (VO):Despite that, according to a report from Aequitas Research, the company plans to release another 2.6 billion shares, worth roughly US$23 billion based on recent stock prices. These shares are expected to be released to the public by the middle of this year, and they could spell trouble for Grab’s shareholders.Aditya Hadi Pratama:The time is similar with the timing of when the lock up period for existing investors of Grab will be open. So maybe there is a possibility that the existing investors will start to sell some of their shares in the company, and some analysts think that that kind of condition, that kind of timeline, will keep pushing the price of Grab’s shares down.Deepti Sri (VO):We’ll be right back.[AD]Deepti Sri (VO):Despite a strong debut on the Nasdaq last month, Grab’s share prices have dipped – and they could plummet further when the company releases more shares into the market this year.But whether or not that happens hinges on the strength of the company’s financial performance in the coming months. While it’s hard to tell what those numbers would look like, it does help to look at Grab’s financials in the past year. So I spoke to Tech in Asia’s industry analyst Simon Huang to break things down.Simon Huang:The important thing to note about the share price is that it can change very quickly, and it’s a leading indicator. So investors can actually bid up the share price, even before the numbers improve, if they like what they see. But I think they are going to want to look at how things pan out this year as the region hopefully emerges from Covid and things normalize.2021, if we look at the whole company, it saw revenues declining throughout the year. So in the fourth quarter of 2020, revenues were at US$219 million. And in 2021 Q3, which is the last quarter we have data for, currently, revenue had declined to US$157 million. And similarly, the EBITDA and net loss figures had also deteriorated over the same period.Of course, Grab is a collection of businesses. And the two most important ones currently, in terms of having the biggest impact, are the deliveries and the mobility business. I think the idea was for mobility to be the unit that is able to generate cash and be profitable so that that can be used to support the other businesses. And if you look at the individual segments for this period that we’re looking at – 2020 Q4 to 2021 Q3 – the deliveries revenue has been quite stagnant while, for mobility, revenue has been declining. And that’s why you see the relatively anemic revenue numbers that we’ve seen over the period and, you know, I think that that is something that may explain why the share price has underperformed.Deepti Sri:Got it. How long do you think it might take Grab for its financials or its operations to turn things around in terms of its share price?Simon Huang:To the extent that we are in a post-Covid, normalized world, I think investors will want to see how the numbers pan out for 2022 and how do mobility and delivery numbers play out over this year. And I think they will be able to get a better idea over the next few quarters. So if the numbers start to climb again, then it may well be that that’s what is needed to turn the share price performance around.Deepti Sri (VO):One other big question mark in Grab’s financials is its Vietnam business, which was the biggest drag on its earnings in Q3 last year. Vietnam has been a difficult market for the ride-hailing giant due to lawsuits and regulatory hurdles impeding its growth. And yet, the country holds a lot of opportunity for Grab, if only the company could capture it.Simon Huang:If you’re looking at a Southeast Asian play, which Grab is, Vietnam is important simply because of its size. It has the third biggest population in the region, behind Indonesia and the Philippines. So any company that wants to sell itself as a proxy for growth in the Southeast Asian technology, internet space, will want to show traction in Vietnam.Deepti Sri (VO):There’s also the question of Grab’s incentives strategy. According to the company’s financial data in the third quarter of 2021, a large majority of its services are fueled by these incentives, which take the form of additional fees for drivers and merchants, or discounts for customers. While this is a good short-term solution to drive growth, it might not be a crutch that Grab can lean on in the long term.Simon Huang:I think it depends on the competitive tensions and also on how indulgent investors are willing to be. If they’re willing to put off profitability for a longer period, then these incentives can continue. And if it’s necessary to maintain or grow Grab’s dominance in the market, they are likely to continue as well.And, of course, this is not something that is entirely within Grab’s control. It depends on what its competitors are doing. So this is a bit of a game between the different players and each player is basing its own decisions on what it thinkt the other players are doing as well. If in Indonesia, Gojek is offering incentives and continues to do so, then it’s going to be difficult for Grab to pull those back.But at some point, in order to be sustainable, these incentives will have to drop away. One of the issues is that it is not certain how far away we are from that point. And that might be causing some investors some concern because they don’t know how long these incentives will be required and, were the incentives to stop, how that will impact Grab’s position in the market.Deepti Sri:And keeping in mind that Grab is operating in such a competitive market, are there any pointers that you’d like to talk about that Grab’s shareholders should be keeping in mind?Simon Huang:It is important to consider each business on its own merits. So keep a lookout for the profitability of mobility and keep a lookout for how quickly deliveries is able to grow. The wildcard is financial services. It’s a huge area, there’s a lot of potential in Southeast Asia because so much of the market currently is underserved or unserved. So Grab having the super app and having the user base is in a great position to be offering various financial products, loans, insurance, investment, to its users, and those should be higher margin.The problem is that so many other companies are also trying to get into this space. So it’s going to be very competitive as well. But I do think that Grab has a unique proposition for financial services if they can execute well. That should be another area to look out for and another potential driver of the share price going forward.Deepti Sri (VO):Despite Grab’s rollercoaster ride of an IPO, it’s a historic moment for Southeast Asian companies. It’s still a story of celebration and the promise of things to come for a region that’s got so much potential. It lays out the IPO blueprint for every Southeast Asian startup, but also shines light on some of the pitfalls that come with going public.Terence Lee:I can see a case for an upside. In the short run, there’s going to be some short-term pricing pressure arising from existing shareholders unloading shares onto the market. But once that clears out, the share price might go up, right? So I think for the other companies, I think it might cause them to maybe take another look at their own share price and their own valuation, but they will also probably understand how investment bank analysts are appraising their valuations.And therefore, yeah, it might not change much if GoTo and Traveloka find that their valuations are still sound, still reasonable. But we’ll see.Deepti Sri (VO):For more stories on Grab or any of the various other leading companies within Asia’s tech and startup scene, visit techin.asia/sub to become a Tech in Asia subscriber or you could also subscribe to this podcast where we’re running Deep Dives every month.But that’s it for this episode.

729459,2022-01-20T02:07:22,2022-01-20T02:07:22,Making sense of Grab’s Jaya Grocer acquisition,grab-jaya-grocer-acquisition,post,"When Grab went to market in 2012, its business model was a straightforward one: being an asset-light go-between.It provided a platform to bridge consumers with services such as ride-hailing and food delivery, and it charged both sides of the supply-demand divide in bringing them together.Jaya Grocer has more than 40 stores in Peninsular Malaysia / Photo credit: Jaya GrocerThings changed after Grab listed on Nasdaq on December 3, raising US$4.5 billion in the process. Less than two weeks later, on December 13, it announced its maiden purchase after going public – a physical asset by way of Malaysian grocery chain Jaya Grocer.Industry insiders who spoke to Tech in Asia believe that the move from being asset-light to owning physical assets marked not only a shift in Grab’s business model, but also a coming-of-age for the ride-hailing giant, which went from a scrappy startup to a publicly listed multinational group.The industry insiders added that the acquisition is a positive for Grab in growing its business vertical, but they also warned that the grocery space, together with quick commerce (q-commerce), is heating up.Breaking down the dealGrab didn’t disclose how much it’s going to pay to buy Jaya Grocer, which runs 40 stores across Peninsular Malaysia. However, Kuala Lumpur-based fund managers and investment bankers covering the consumer and retail sectors estimate that the deal costs anywhere between 1.5 billion and 1.8 billion ringgit (between US$358.6 million and US$430.3 million).See also: Grab to buy Malaysian grocery majorCoincidentally, Grab’s purchase also came just 17 days after Jaya Grocer’s founders, the Teng family, bought back their entire stake in the grocery chain from AIGF Advisors, which surfaced as a shareholder in 2016 after investing 300 million ringgit (US$71.7 million) in Jaya Grocer.The Teng family bought back AIGF’s 45% stake for about 411 million ringgit (US$98.2 million), according to business publication The Edge. This means that the family possibly got a sweet deal from buying back its stake and selling it to Grab.Teng Yew Huat is Jaya Grocer’s major shareholder, owning 55% of the company.A ‘strategic move’Victor Chua, managing partner of Kuala Lumpur-based VC firm Vynn Capital, dubbed Grab’s acquisition as a “strategic move” for two reasons.“Firstly, it is a move to further strengthen its value chain by moving down the supply chain to better optimize operations and profits,” Chua explains. “Secondly, to have a more holistic online-offline two-pronged model. Either of these reasons contribute toward Grab’s ambition to be a super app.”Another potential benefit is that Grab users can access one merchant with a wide assortment of products – Jaya Grocer – for all their groceries, rather than visiting a minimart via the app only to find that certain products aren’t available. This makes Grab more competitive against Lazada and Shopee.Jaya Grocer is a profitable concern. In its latest filing, the grocery chain posted a net profit of 68 million ringgit (US$16.3 million) on the back of 1.3 billion ringgit (US$320.3 million) in revenue for the financial year ended December 30, 2020.The other boon for Grab is that Jaya Grocer doesn’t have to follow Malaysia’s ethnic-based preferential policies, at least for now.Malaysia’s distributive trade services guidelines state that retailers operating stores less than 4,999 square meters in size no longer have to meet the 30% bumiputera equity requirement in distributive trade services. This requirement is an affirmative action policy that requires businesses to give up at least 30% of ownership in their company to the country’s largest ethnic group, the Malays.An investment banker covering Southeast Asian markets argues that the acquisition provides Grab with a forgiving learning curve.“Jaya Grocer has experience managing upstream logistics, especially in ensuring products are well-stocked and optimizing space and distribution,” said the investment banker.“The grocery stores could also be turned into distribution hubs for delivery riders,” the investment banker added. “This puts the company ahead of the q-commerce game because currently its rivals are just in the dark store space, which is basically a warehouse of popular items. They (competitors) may run out of items but Grab can leverage the relationship Jaya Grocer has with its suppliers.”Intense competitionBut can Grab catch up to its competitors? It was late to the dark store space in Malaysia, with the first mover being Foodpanda, which has set up its Pandamarts and an extensive network of partner retailers such as 7-Eleven around the country. Foodpanda rolled out its q-commerce operations in Malaysia, including grocery delivery, in 2019 – well before the pandemic.See also: Dark stores light up red-hot grocery delivery marketAfzan Lutfi, new verticals director at Foodpanda, tells Tech in Asia that the company runs more than 50 Pandamarts nationwide, including in Sabah and Sarawak. That alone puts Foodpanda in an advantageous position, as Jaya Grocer lacks a presence in East Malaysia.The interior of a Pandamart outlet in Kuala Lumpur / Photo credit: FoodpandaAfzan also said the Foodpanda’s approach has been two-pronged: working with large hypermarket chains as well as hyperlocal favorites. Across West Malaysia, it has partnered with names such as Village Grocer, Mydin, Lotus’s (formerly Tesco Malaysia), Midas Mart, Mercearia Grocer, and Pasaraya LCY. In East Malaysia, it works with brands like Everrise, CKS Supermarket, and Servay.Grab tried competing with Foodpanda by launching GrabMart. But in Malaysia, its instant delivery service is only open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., with next-day or scheduled deliveries from 7 a.m. to 11.30 p.m.That still trails Foodpanda, which promises quicker deliveries across longer hours. In Malaysia, Pandamarts are open from 7 a.m. to 11.30 p.m., while some branches in Singapore are open 24 hours a day.Afzan adds that Foodpanda can fulfill grocery deliveries in “as quick as 20 to 25 minutes from order placement.”To stay ahead, Foodpanda’s game plan is to share with its partners insights generated from the company’s data science team on “early indicators of where the market is moving,” he said.“A simple example of this is when we identified a spike in the purchase of contraceptive SKUs (stock-keeping units) and pregnancy test kits in the early stages of lockdown. We then shared these insights with our partners and worked with them to list and flesh out mother and baby categories, and pre-plan marketing efforts to feature these categories,” Afzan told Tech in Asia.Foodpanda estimates that its delivery zones can cover over 70% of Malaysia’s population, with Afzan adding the company is “committed to expanding” its coverage.Market participants are also expecting Shopee, which has been aggressively expanding its deliveries vertical, to move into q-commerce soon. Since early last year, it has already been operating an online supermarket with next-day delivery for orders placed before noon. Its parent company, Sea Group, has deep pockets with cash and cash equivalents amounting to US$11 billion as of September 30, 2021.Despite the competition, the Jaya Grocer acquisition “remains Grab’s strategy, and it’s so far the only one with some certainty for the company. So it’s a reasonable bet,” said the investment banker.He pointed to the “uncertainty” around Grab’s bid to run a digital banking license in Malaysia. The country’s central bank, Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM), has said that only five firms will be awarded the license.The bank received about 29 applications, representing conventional and Islamic financial institutions, with the winners to be announced during the first quarter of this year, BNM said in a statement last July.“To be sure, it’s just that: there are too many competitors. And, while Grab has the technology and expertise to run a digital banking business, you can only award the license to five bidders, which makes choosing winners a tough one,” the investment banker added.Grab is competing with government-linked companies, politically-controlled firms, telcos and banks, state governments, and privately-held conglomerates for the license.Bullish on deliveriesGrab posted US$212 million in adjusted losses before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (or negative EBITDA) in the third quarter of 2021, widening from US$128 million in the same period the previous year.See also: Grab’s financial health in 8 chartsBut its deliveries segment for the same quarter grew 63% year-on-year, with a gross merchandise value (GMV) of US$2.3 billion, according to Grab.GrabMart, it added, continued to show strong traction, with GMV growing around 380% year-on-year and 78% compared to the previous quarter.Grab is doubling down on its deliveries segment by forming new partnerships across Southeast Asia. These include Indonesian convenience store chain Indomaret, Thai hypermarket brand Big C, Vietnamese wholesaler Mega Market, and Malaysian retailer Lotus’s.According to tech venture platform Momentum Works, Malaysia’s food delivery GMV reached US$1.1 billion in 2020, with Grab and Foodpanda owning a market share of 52% and 48%, respectively.Lockdown dependent?However, not all are sold on the grocery hype. An industry figure pointed out that Grab may have raked in cash only because of pandemic-induced travel restrictions where many opted for home-cooked meals.“My personal view is that many who worked from home opted to cook and not use the app too much for deliveries because it can get expensive,” said the industry figure.A few signals are pointing to people leaving their homes for shopping trips again.Google’s Covid-19 Community Mobility Report for Malaysia showed that trips made to supermarkets and pharmacies were up 21% nationwide on January 12 compared to the previous week.A number of management staff from two major Malaysian supermarket chains also told Tech in Asia that they have been seeing a rise in foot traffic as well as physical transactions ever since the government lifted travel bans in October last year.They estimate an increase of 50% to 70% in customers from December 2021, especially for stores around the Klang Valley and in certain states such as Penang and Johor.Despite fears of the Covid-19 pandemic worsening due to the Omicron variant, Malaysian health minister Khairy Jamaluddin said his government wanted to avoid lockdowns and, instead, use a warning mechanism.If this trend continues, Grab’s Jaya Grocer acquisition opens another possibility: a hedge against a slowing online groceries space. If more people shop for groceries and rely less on delivery services, including Grab’s super app, then Jaya Grocer can be relied on to bring in revenue from walk-in customers.May not be easily replicableAnother challenge for Grab would be replicating the Jaya Grocer acquisition in other markets. Grab declined to say if the group will be making similar buys outside Malaysia.Grab commands food delivery market share in Malaysia / Photo credit: GrabVynn Capital’s Chua notes that it may not be an easy strategy to replicate as it depends on successfully finding local grocery chains that could complement the business.“The other alternative is for Grab to expand Jaya Grocer to other markets, relying on the experienced team at the grocer,” he added.If Grab is able to make the Jaya Grocer deal work, then it isn’t farfetched to assume that it will be looking to expand regionally. But, above all else, Grab has to perform a balancing act between growing its business and pleasing shareholders.“It also has to appease shareholders who will be demanding dividends, among others. I don’t envy them but I believe they are on the right path with the Jaya Grocer buy,” another Kuala Lumpur-based VC said.Currency converted from Malaysian ringgit to US dollar: US$1 = 4.18 ringgit.","The deal marks a seismic shift in Grab’s ecommerce push, but its foray into the grocery space may not be a smooth ride.",694195,Emmanuel Samarathisa,True,Terence Lee and Lorenzo Kyle Subido,0,"['Analysis', 'Ecommerce', 'Premium Content']","['Anthony Tan', 'bank negara malaysia', 'Big C', 'dark stores', 'digital banking', 'e-commerce', 'foodpanda', 'Grab', 'grocery chain', 'jaya grocer', ""Lotus's Malaysia"", 'Mega Market', 'q commerce', 'shopee', 'Southeast Asia']",False,,True,True,True,False,8

Get the newsletter in your inbox everyday with a Premium subscription.Hello reader,Anyone looking to grow their capital needs to have knowledge of finance and investing. But the jargon and data-centric content often scare people off from picking up the basic financial know-how to build wealth securely.In fact, most people consider finance and investing uninteresting or “dry” topics. Like math, these subjects are loathed by millions. However, I think that’s because of a few unfair misconceptions. The world of finance and investing somehow manages to keep its participants alert and excited.Whether it’s a startup’s massive funding round, the disintegration of a conglomerate, legal tussles, pressure from activist investors, mammoth M&amp;As, or drastic stock market swings, the space has a lot that keeps its stakeholders deeply engaged.Today, we put the spotlight on Sequoia Capital’s unique attempt to revamp the VC model of 10-year funding horizons – in use since the 1970s – and ponder over its applicability in Asia.Today we look at,Whether Asia is ready for Sequoia’s perpetual fund modelA Singapore ecommerce roll-up firm’s US$100 million target for brand acquisitionsOther newsy highlights such as a US$90 million pampering and Carousell’s brave choiceAlso, if you’re an entrepreneur looking for funding, fill out this form to get your company featured on our list of fundraising startups.Premium summaryChange for the better, right?Image credit: Timmy LoenThe Sequoia Fund offers an “open-ended liquid portfolio” in a selection of Sequoia-backed companies. Roelof Botha, a partner at the firm, claims this is the startup investment giant’s “boldest innovation yet”. It allows limited partners (LPs) to participate in a company’s fundraise at any time, from inception to IPO and beyond.It’s a seismic shift in the world of VCs, where the norm is to invest and ultimately return capital to LPs within a 10-year window. However, is this change revolutionary? Or are these funds better investment options than dividend-paying evergreen funds, which operate indefinitely?One size doesn’t fit all: The Sequoia Fund model has so far only been applied in its businesses in the US and Europe. It’s not a strategy that’s used yet for the firm’s operations in India, China, and Southeast Asia. One explanation is that Asia’s startup scene simply isn’t ready for a perpetual funding model. “Our ecosystem is so young,” said a representative of a VC firm that invests in Southeast Asia.A damning statement: Sequoia’s Botha pointed out how perpetual funding would remove the “rigid” and “artificial” 10-year funding horizon that has been used since the 1970s – a model that Botha described as “the business equivalent of floppy disks.” But while it is new for venture funds, it is not a new concept overall.Not everything is as it seems: The Southeast Asia-centric VC representative suggested that it was fund managers – rather than startups – who benefit more from employing an evergreen funding structure. “This is just another way to get ‘permanent capital,’” the representative said. “Evergreen capital is like the holy grail for many fund managers. It’s a load off if you don’t have to keep raising 10-year funds.”Read more: Is Asia ready for Sequoia’s perpetual fund model?Startup spotlightRewards for (strategic) hoardingTeam Rainforest (from left) VP of acquisitions Yev Ivanko, co-founder and CEO JJ Chai, and co-founder and CFO Jason Tan / Photo credit: RainforestEcommerce roll-up firms are still relatively young, but have already made a splash. The industry first grabbed headlines when Thrasio became the fastest US company to reach unicorn status, achieving the milestone in just six months. Not long after, its India-based peer, Mensa Brands matched the feat and entered the coveted billion-dollar club in six months.Now, interest in ecommerce roll-up companies has hit a fever pitch and Singapore-based Rainforest is doubling down as it looks to deploy over US$100 million to acquire digital retail brands in 2022.More of the same, please!: Rainforest has bought 12 brands so far – a number it plans to triple this year. The firm will continue to focus on categories such as maternity, baby, and home, where the target buyers are modern mothers. The company has hit US$30 million in annualized revenue within its first full year of operations.A clear strategy: The rollup firm focuses on brand owners based in the Asia Pacific and selling internationally. Most Rainforest brands sell to consumers in North America and Europe. “We expect that to continue, with a heavy focus on China, where there is a large pool of cross-border sellers,” JJ Chai, Rainforest’s co-founder and CEO, told Tech in Asia.Going beyond Amazon: Launched in 2021 by Chai, who previously held executive positions at Airbnb and Carousell, and Jason Tan, the former CFO of Ovo and Fave, Rainforest acquires and scales Amazon marketplace sellers in Asia. This year, Rainforest’s acquisitions will not be limited to retailers selling on Amazon.In partnership withGet a head start on tax seasonThe new year brings with it a new tax season – for many, a dreaded time that signals the yearly deluge of documents to be filled up.

Delivered every Wednesday via email and through the Tech in Asia website, this free newsletter breaks down the biggest stories and trends in fintech. If you’re not a subscriber, get access by registering here.Hello there,About five years ago, a friend told me he had gotten into Ethereum. Over a coffee, he geeked out about the cryptocurrency’s potential to power “smart contracts” – in certificates of education, for example.That was 2017 – the “early” days of cryptomania, the year CryptoKitties was launched, a few months before the crypto winter of 2018, and when Dogecoin was still a joke. (Depending on which way you lean, it might still be.)One wishes they got into Ethereum in 2017. (This is not investment advice.) / Photo credit: CoinbaseFive years on, the metaverse, NFTs, decentralization, and Web3 have become familiar to every man on the street, regardless of whether most people truly understand what these terms mean or believe in their potential.Or should I say, every boy on the street – since crypto investors are, in fact, getting younger.Gen Z, which is made up of school children and teenagers, is getting onboard the crypto train. Perhaps they’re driven by Covid-induced boredom (à la Gamestop), access to play-to-earn games, the desperation to make a quick buck, or their general openness to new tech and risk taking.Not being old enough to invest themselves, some Gen Zs in Vietnam are borrowing money from their parents to put into cryptocurrency.In fact, the country has more people who own digital coins than those with retail stock brokerage accounts. Nearly 6 million people – or about 6% of Vietnam’s population – own cryptocurrencies, placing the country among the top five in the world for crypto adoption.What’s behind Vietnam’s crypto rush, and could rapid adoption propel the country’s transformation into the next global blockchain hub? My colleague, Huong, has the answers in this week’s Big Story.Also, we analyze what United Overseas Bank’s (UOB) US$3.6 billion acquisition of Citigroup’s consumer banking business in four ASEAN markets means for the Singapore-based lender’s digital banking endeavor and regional ambitions. Read on to find out.And what about my friend, you ask? I hope he’s still holding on to that Ethereum.— MelissaTHE BIG STORYExplaining Vietnam’s crypto boomImage credit: Timmy LoenWhile the country’s young investors are loving the short-term profits fromcryptocurrencies, startups hope the trend will power the rise of Web3.THE HOT TAKESupercharging UOB’s ambitions in SEAThe UOB team at the launch of TMRW / Source: UOBHere’s what happened:Last Friday, Singapore’s UOB said it would be acquiring Citigroup’s consumer banking businesses in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam.Citigroup’s consumer business consists of its unsecured and secured lending portfolios as well as its retail deposit and wealth management units.Citigroup will retain control of its institutional banking businesses in these markets. The deal is expected to be completed between mid-2022 and early 2024.Here’s our take:The stakes are high in the race to become one of Southeast Asia’s leading digital banks – and even higher in places like Indonesia and Vietnam, which have large unbanked and underbanked populations.Analysts across the board have given the sale a thumbs up. Besides having a positive impact on UOB’s return on equity, earnings per share, and other performance metrics, the deal is widely seen to be strengthening UOB’s presence in the four regional markets. It will also fast-track the bank’s regional digital banking ambitions.Since 2019, the bank has plowed US$148 million into developing TMRW (pronounced ‘tomorrow’), its mobile-only digital bank in Indonesia and Thailand.Then last September, UOB threw another S$500 million (US$371 million) into the effort. Part of that investment was used to combine its TMRW app, available in Indonesia and Thailand, with its Singapore mobile app in a bid to forge a new and improved version called UOB TMRW.Its latest mobile interface is intuitive, to say the least, and offers investment products as well as insights into spending habits – almost a norm these days.The bank has said that it plans to introduce more digital-only wealth products, the use of chatbots, and to leverage data to inform customers of the types of financial solutions available to them .If anything, it sends a message that UOB means business. Despite launching in 2019, TMRW is far from a household name in both Indonesia and Thailand. As of September last year, it had just over 350,000 registered users, most of whom were from Indonesia, as we previously reported.That’s why UOB’s acquisition of Citigroup’s assets is highly strategic: The move could supercharge UOB’s customer base in the four markets, almost instantly expanding its user base to 5.3 million from 2.9 million. Its Thailand business would see the biggest boost, growing to 2.4 million customers – an addition of 1.1 million users.While Citi’s retail customers don’t automatically become users of UOB’s digital app, it’s certainly possible to convert them through cross-selling.That said, UOB is not the only bank swooping in on the blue-ocean market.In Indonesia, the digital banking scene is heating up, with more tech firms and incumbent banks backing small lenders. The likes of WeLab and a joint Sea Group-BNI effort have joined the space in just the past month alone.Gojek’s Bank Jago and Akulaku-backed Neo have exceeded TMRW in terms of active users and cumulative downloads, according to estimates, even though both were launched more recently.In 2020, Indonesia’s Jenius brought on 1.4 million new customers, taking its total user count to over 3 million, according to consultancy firm Momentum Works. DBS’ Digibank, meanwhile, added 200,000 new users in the same period to reach about 800,000 customers.Granted, UOB is chasing high-quality customers – also known as the “emerging affluent,” who deposit relatively large sums of money – as opposed to onboarding a large customer base through discounts. This might explain its smaller customer base and slower pace of growth.The Citigroup deal directly plays to its strategy. The move potentially increases UOB’s mass affluent customers by 81% and emerging affluent customers by 1.7x, as per one analyst’s estimates. This would give UOB a “critical advantage” against its competitors.– MelissaNEWS YOU SHOULD KNOWCheck out Tech in Asia’s coverage of the fintech scene here.1️⃣ MAS stops crypto platforms from advertising in public: Under the guidelines effective immediately, crypto service providers, banks, and financial institutions should not market or advertise such services in public areas in Singapore, or through third parties like social media influencers.2️⃣ Validus forms JV in Vietnam for new fund: The joint venture was formed by Validus Vietnam, multinational conglomerate TTC Group, and early-stage VC firm Do Ventures.

The ESOP buyback program, a routine activity conducted by the firm, allows some employees to earn “up to six figures in cash” from the liquidity exercise.ESOPs (employee stock ownership plans) are a talent recruitment and retention strategy that startups employ. And as demand for talent increases, its use as an incentive has picked up pace alongside the growth of Southeast Asia’s startup ecosystem. Typically, after a three- to five-year vesting period, employees can exercise their stock options upon an event, such as an exit.In Circles Life’s case, all full-time employees, regardless of rank or tenure, get two months’ worth of stock options as part of their basic compensation at 12-month intervals.Circles Life’s approach to ESOPs has renewed conversations on how ESOP schemes are structured in Southeast Asia and how founders should design and implement their own programs.If you want to learn about the telco’s philosophy toward ESOPs and how these programs can be better structured and utilized in the region for talent recruitment and retention, join our Ask Me Anything session on January 25 with Rameez Ansar, co-founder of Circles Life.We encourage participants to submit questions for Rameez ahead of the session here.RegistrationThis event is free! Simply click on the RSVP button on the right to register.Watch also: How Southeast Asian startups can use ESOPs to their advantageSpeaker overviewFor Ansar, launching Circles Life has been an exciting opportunity to transform Singapore’s telco industry with homegrown technology, as well as a chance to create a launchpad to effect global innovation.Ansar also co-founded and managed TechCube8, a technology, media, and telecoms-focused venture fund that received co-investment from the National Research Foundation of Singapore.

Year after year, universities churn out hundreds of thousands of young talent, and a seemingly infinite amount of professionals strive to find better opportunities at other companies.This process can also be lengthy, with a position taking an average of 36 days to fill. Recruiters carry this burden, with many of them going through hundreds of applications to look for the 10 or so candidates that are actually qualified.“We understand the challenges of a recruiter through first-hand experience,” Achuthanand Ravi, co-founder and CEO at recruitment automation startup Kula, tells Tech in Asia.The San Francisco-based company, which has emerged from stealth mode, has just raised US$2.7 million in a pre-seed round from Venture Highway, Together Fund, and Global Founders Capital to help employers hire more candidates.(From left) Kula founders Suman Kumar Dey, Achuthanand Tanjore Ravi, and Sathappan Muthupalaniappan / Photo credit: KulaRight tools for the jobAccording to Ravi, the idea behind Kula hit him during his time at Stripe, where he served on the payments major’s global executive search team.The founder tells Tech in Asia that while on the hunt for leadership-level talent, he and his team were in constant search for a tool that could help them solve all the operational parts of the talent engagement process.“Our requirement wasn’t outlandish – we just wanted a tool that can send cold emails, automate follow-ups, and keep the passive talent engaged. Marketing and sales teams have had tools like these for decades,” he adds.After evaluating dozens of products and not finding software that suited his needs, Ravi knew he had to build one himself.Photo credit: KulaNow with Kula, Ravi looks to build a streamlined and transparent recruitment automation platform for those that deal with a company’s recruitment process. The startup’s solution brings together all job seeker sources and automates recruitment.With the platform, recruiters can focus more on the candidates that are best suited for certain positions and send out automated follow-ups through several channels.Kula is planning for an alpha release of its platform in February this year. For the pilot program, it has also handpicked customers across different business stages and geographies to better understand their specific needs, says Ravi.“From Southeast Asia, we have Gojek and Open Government Products SG, and Wise is also a part of our pilot program,” he adds. Companies like ShareChat and Meesho are also part of this lineup, according to Kula’s website.Recruiting the heavyweightsKnowing the names behind Kula, it isn’t a surprise that the company has already roped in these major companies as initial clients.Joining Ravi are his co-founders Suman Kumar Dey, a former tech lead at Freshworks and software engineer for Grab, and Sathappan Muthupalaniappan, who previously served as a software engineer manager for both Grab and ShopBack.The three currently helm a founding team of eight people, which includes engineers, designers, marketers, and a recruiter in Ravi. The company aims to expand this number to at least 28 by the next six months, the CEO says.By expanding its team, Kula looks to build a tech stack that can serve as an operating system for the recruitment needs of its pilot customers.“We would then take the product to all customers and get as much usage and feedback from the recruitment fraternity,” he adds. “We also want to grow the team steadily and be ready for the phase when we hit hypergrowth.”To help with this, Ravi said that Kula would be open to raising additional capital. “We haven’t decided on the fine prints yet, but there are some advanced conversations with some of our wishlist funds.”","Kula, which just raised US$2.7 million, is set to pilot its services with clients like Gojek, Wise, and ShareChat.",270460,Miguel Cordon,True,Collin Furtado and Jaclyn Tiu,0,"['Investments', 'News', 'Startups']","['Global Founders Capital', 'hrtech', 'kula', 'recruitment', 'Startup Funding', 'startups in the us', 'Together Fund', 'US', 'Venture Highway']",False,,True,False,True,False,3

The country is home to a young, internet-savvy population that has the world at its fingertips, and these people have had the K-wave wash over them via social media, YouTube, and Netflix.Because of this, it’s no surprise that Indonesian tech giant Tokopedia has used the K-wave in its marketing strategies, seeking to meet customers where they are and connecting with them in more meaningful ways.The power of shoppertainmentAccording to Hilda Kitti, vice president of marketing at Tokopedia, the firm leveraged the power of the K-wave for its campaigns as the phenomenon felt like a natural extension of how it could reach out to more customers.“As marketers, it’s very important to stay relevant to your target audience,” she explains. “At Tokopedia, we saw that several segments of our customers – like the younger age group, or female consumers – were very into K-entertainment, especially K-pop, and we decided we ought to bring these elements into our marketing so that we can better engage with our consumers.”Hilda Kitti, vice president of marketing at Tokopedia / Photo credit: TokopediaThe firm brought on K-pop groups BTS and Blackpink as brand ambassadors in 2021, and it often features Korean artists on its monthly television show Waktu Indonesia Belanja (WIB). A “shoppertainment” program, WIB airs on the 25th of every month and marks the start of a sales campaign that runs till the month ends.WIB serves as a way for Tokopedia to get customers to learn more about its products and services. The program intersperses entertainment content with promotional segments detailing the latest deals happening on the Tokopedia app, such as flash sales, discounts, and cashback promotions.The show features different elements, ranging from comedy skits by local stars to performances from Indonesian musicians. But Tokopedia also brings K-pop stars into the program – BTS appeared on WIB in July 2020, becoming the first of many Korean groups to become a guest on the show.By featuring K-pop artists and other celebrities on WIB, Tokopedia gets more eyeballs on its latest campaigns and promotions. People may tune in to catch their favorite stars, but they also learn about what Tokopedia has to offer.“We use TV, Tokopedia Play – our own streaming platform – and YouTube as a mass medium,” says Kitti. “It reaches many parts of Indonesia, and provides us with a way of educating people around the country about the benefits of ecommerce.”Branding and brand loyaltyAfter over a year of having K-pop stars as guests on WIB, Tokopedia decided to run its WIB Indonesia K-pop Awards in November 2021. According to Kitti, it was a much grander version of WIB, featuring performances from 10 K-pop groups alongside numerous deals and promotions on the Tokopedia app.“We’ve been engaging with multiple K-pop fandoms over the last year or so, and we wanted to do something special to thank them for their support,” she shares.Photo credit: TokopediaBy bringing K-pop idols onto Tokopedia’s platform, the firm achieves several things. Aside from attracting customers through the deals available during the program, it also propels Tokopedia onto the international stage, allowing fans from outside Indonesia to learn more about the company when they tune in to watch their favorite stars perform.“While Tokopedia operates only in Indonesia, it shows people that Indonesia is home to businesses that can attract global stars to work with and collaborate with them,” explains Kitti. “Indonesian fans also feel proud that a local company is able to do something of this scale, which helps create brand loyalty.”While coordinating and monitoring performances between South Korea and Indonesia has been challenging, especially in the face of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, Tokopedia’s efforts in using K-pop as part of its marketing strategy have paid off.Though unable to disclose any specific numbers, Kitti reveals that WIB often marks the biggest sales period for Tokopedia every month.“In terms of business performance – traffic, number of orders, number of new customers coming on board, et cetera – that period is when all these numbers peak,” she shares.An incentive to tryAside from being a means of getting Tokopedia’s name out there and creating brand loyalty, the firm also leverages the power of the K-wave in getting users to try out new offerings on the platform.For example, when Tokopedia wanted to get more customers to order products available through TokoCabang, its fulfillment and warehousing service, it created a photocard campaign to incentivize K-pop fans to use the service.K-pop photocards function similarly to trading cards, featuring exclusive images of the celebrities in question. Some cards are harder to acquire than others, being limited to particular events or brands.Tokopedia created exclusive photocards of BTS for its campaign on TokoCabang, offering limited-time opportunities to acquire these cards as a gift when customers bought an item available through the fulfillment service.Photo credit: Tokopedia“It creates a good experience for users,” explains Kitti. “If a user is signing up and trying out TokoCabang for the first time, they’re able to get a product they need, they experience the benefits of being serviced by TokoCabang’s free, speedy, and quality delivery – and, of course, they get a photocard of their favorite K-pop idol.”From her perspective, a new user may try out TokoCabang because of the photocard, but after using the service and enjoying its benefits, they’re more likely to return and purchase other items.Tokopedia has seen success with the strategy – certain BTS photocards sold out within minutes from launch. However, the promotion created some unforeseen challenges for the firm.“You do have fans who are unhappy about things selling out so quickly,” says Kitti. “But we use it as an opportunity to learn, to improve the mechanics of how these campaigns work, so that we can come back with better mechanics.”Riding the K-waveOn top of working with K-pop celebrities, Tokopedia is also exploring other facets of K-entertainment.The firm recently launched Mantul House, a talk show available on Tokopedia Play. The show brings in actors from popular K-dramas to chat with a host, play games, and experience Indonesian culture, such as through sampling the country’s cuisine.“The K-wave is here to stay, and we hope to keep finding new and unexpected ways to connect with fans and customers,” says Kitti. “We plan on experimenting with different formats and seeing what new trends come up.”Kitti’s hopes that through these efforts, Tokopedia will serve as a bridge between Indonesia and the rest of the world.“We want to bring more Indonesian culture into the mix along with these K-entertainment stars. It’s not just about getting more customers on board, it’s also about bringing Indonesia to a larger audience,” she concludes.Tokopedia is an Indonesian tech company with the country’s biggest marketplace.

729190,2022-01-19T01:55:23,2022-01-19T02:40:20,Explaining Vietnam’s crypto boom,explaining-vietnams-crypto-boom,post,"Nam Nguyen joined the crypto craze in March 2021 and has invested about US$3,000. Being a newbie, he says, actually offered some advantages. “I didn’t read a lot. I was decisive because I didn’t know much and wasn’t afraid of anything.”Nam ended up making enough money from crypto to rescue his restaurant in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, which was shut down for months due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Photo credit: Shutterstock Restrictions in the country have since been lifted, and his business has been up and running. In turn, the restaurant generates money to sustain Nam’s crypto bets. The 25-year-old doesn’t mind that his crypto assets have lost about 46% in value lately.“Unlike the stock market, the crypto world is more convenient for me because it’s 24/7,” he tells Tech in Asia. “I often wake up late, and that means I’ve already missed the stock market’s morning trading session.”Considering that Vietnam is still primarily a cash-based society, crypto adoption is surprisingly high.Nearly 6 million people – or about 6% of the population – own the digital asset, putting the country among the top five in the world, according to data from cryptocurrency payments firm TripleA. Vietnam and India also led research firm Chainalysis’ global ranking of crypto adoption by individual investors.Years ago, Vietnam’s young and tech-savvy population leapfrogged the desktop and went straight to mobile. Today, the same story is happening with cryptocurrency.Despite not being recognized by the government, the virtual currency has already become a hot investment asset, especially among millennials and Gen Z.The Covid-19 pandemic and Axie Infinity – a play-to-earn game that has achieved global fame from its base in Ho Chi Minh City – have contributed to the growing allure of crypto.Forget about real estate and gold; suddenly, everyone is “playing” coins.Photo credit: ©velivinki/123rf.comGrassroots adoptionTrung Nguyen joined the market in 2014 but luckily quit in 2018 before the crypto winter hit. He returned in 2020 and now likes to stay informed by reading and consulting different sources. “Currently, my portfolio is: 40% crypto, 40% stocks and 20% savings,” he adds.Born in 1996, Trung considers himself “old” compared to today’s crypto traders. “Gen Z knows more about the market than I do,” he says, adding that some even “borrow money from their parents to play crypto.”The pandemic has dampened other business channels, and that’s why people want to bet on crypto.Similar to South Korea, where crypto is seen as “a way out” for young people, many here also don’t see a path to financial freedom even if they have a stable job. “Instead of working so hard to get 20 million dong (US$870) a month, it’s possible that you can earn 10 million dong a day from crypto,” Trung estimates.The number of online groups for like-minded crypto traders to meet and share tips in the Vietnamese language has exploded. Scams like the latest one involving NFT game CryptoBike are frequently reported, but it’s not enough to discourage some traders from aiming to get rich quickly from crypto.Nicole Nguyen, who has witnessed how the local blockchain scene evolved over a decade, says she’s not surprised that crypto is gaining unprecedented traction in Vietnam.She has noticed a strong sense of “group culture” among local crypto adopters. This means that if someone senses an opportunity, they often advise friends or family members in the same network to join or buy a certain coin.“The pandemic has dampened other business channels, and that’s why people want to bet on crypto, which is open and borderless,” says Nicole, who also co-founded NFT project Duelist King and is a consultant for Blockchain Founders Fund.Since late April 2021, Vietnam has been reeling from another wave of Covid-19, which has infected more than 2 million and killed 35,975 people as of January 18. The economy grew only 2.58% in 2021, slowing down from 2.91% in 2020, when the virus was fairly well-contained.Traditional ways to invest like real estate and gold have been hit by pandemic-induced lockdowns. But even before Covid-19 struck, they were generally inaccessible to most people in the middle-income class. Meanwhile, interest rates have been on a decline.A high-rise building in Ho Chi Minh City / Photo credit: 123rfBesides crypto, retail investors have also been rushing to the stock market. Nearly 1.3 million new securities accounts were opened by November 2021, echoing trends elsewhere including India.See also:Trial by fire awaits Zerodha, India’s hottest stockbroking appThe growth in Vietnam is astonishing, given that the number of new retail stock brokerage accounts make up around a quarter of the total (4 million), which corresponds to only about 3% of the country’s population.But for young serial entrepreneur Duc Trinh, the domestic stock market doesn’t have the flexibility of crypto as well as the appeal of NFTs, blockchain, and Web3 (or the decentralized web).Trinh had established accessories maker Curnon Watch and eyewear specialist WeeHours as brands for young consumers. In late 2021, he co-founded Neko, an “all-in-one” investment app that aims to “democratize cryptocurrency investment.” Trinh estimates that crypto adoption in Vietnam is growing at a rate that is 7x faster than the stock market.The next Axie Infinity in DeFiThe global success of Axie Infinity has put the spotlight on Vietnam’s gaming sector, which was under pressure to produce the next Flappy Bird, the once-addictive mobile casual game.Sky Mavis, the three-year-old startup that’s behind Axie Infinity, has far surpassed that goal. Its valuation has shot up to US$3 billion, and at one point last year, the game had reportedly racked up nearly 2 million daily active users.See also: Ourcoverage on Axie InfinityFollowing the Axie phenomenon, teams in Vietnam have been scrambling to ride the crypto-gaming wave, with new GameFi projects being introduced into the market almost on a weekly basis.Jun Wakabayashi, an associate with VC firm and accelerator AppWorks, thinks it’s not a coincidence that GameFi has become “a big thing” in Vietnam. “Even before this crypto hype, Vietnam has already been very strong on casual and semi-casual games. But it’s just the tip of the iceberg,” he observes.AppWorks closed US$150 million for its Fund III last August, with blockchain identified as a core investment theme. The firm mainly focuses on Taiwan and Southeast Asia.As GameFi drives people, especially those that are outside the traditional banking system, to learn and adopt crypto, Wakabayashi believes that the trend will inspire teams to build other financial products.The wider tech community in Vietnam also shares that same sentiment, welcoming the increased adoption from more people in the “mainstream.”For Vinh The Nguyen, co-founder and CEO of Coin98, it makes sense that GameFi has become the hottest category. “It might be easier for these projects to generate revenue or adopt new users. The concern is that resources could have been better used by other teams that want to build other stuff on blockchain,” he says.Founded in 2017, Coin98 allows users to swap, borrow, lend, invest, and earn crypto. The team says it has over 1 million users in more than 150 countries, and about 25% of them come from Vietnam.Coin98 was originally a blockchain and crypto research company, but it pivoted to building products in 2019 after surviving the 2018 crypto crash. It operates Coin98 Insights, a platform to spread blockchain and crypto knowledge in Vietnamese to newbies and advanced users alike.The startup says it wants to support users who can approach crypto with critical thinking instead of just gunning for short-term profits. Vinh believes such educational efforts are crucial to widespread adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi), which refers to financial tools that remove the need for intermediaries such as banks or brokers.Coin98’s vision is to build a super app for users to access the DeFi ecosystem, which its CEO describes as “leveling up” what Binance, the crypto exchange major, has done. However, unlike Binance, Coin98 says it is “decentralized”: In simplest terms, this means that only users have control over their assets.Photo credit: Coin98Binance, in fact, recognizes Coin98’s efforts. Binance Labs, the global platform’s venture capital and incubator arm, recently announced a strategic investment in Coin98.Prior to this, the startup had raised about US$16.5 million from investors, according to Crunchbase data.For better or worse, “crypto is the first introduction to investing for many Vietnamese people and others in Southeast Asia,” says Peter Hoang, CEO and co-founder of crypto investment platform Finblox. “For the first time, they have access to a global asset class and are able to invest with the rest of the world.”Launched in November 2021, Finblox has already raised funding from prominent institutional investors like Sequoia Capital India and CoinFund. The Hong Kong-based platform wants users to hold on to their crypto assets and earn yields instead of trading them.Finblox claims that it could offer up to 10% annual percentage yield on coins such as USDC and BTC as well as a much higher interest for Axie’s tokens. The startup does so by lending the crypto to financial institutions.Hoang estimates that despite the current hype, only about 2% of Southeast Asia’s population has had exposure to crypto. Finblox hopes to bridge that gap.“I believe that crypto is the best on-ramp into the world of investing and gives access to the exciting alternative financial system,” he adds. On-ramp refers to a service that allows for the exchange of traditional or fiat money for cryptocurrencies.Gray areaVietnam doesn’t have a clear legal framework on cryptocurrencies, so the trading of such assets remains in a gray area. Technically, users canrely on peer-to-peer exchanges like Binance to buy crypto assets from other individuals.Early last year, Binance announced the launch of P2P trading services for Vietnamese dong (VND). Changpeng Zhao, Binance’s CEO and founder, was quoted as saying the country could be “the next global blockchain hub.”In 2018, the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV), however, issued a statementbanningall cryptocurrency-related transactions via the banking system. This means that users cannot use banks to buy or convert crypto assets.Photo credit: Burdun / 123RFIn July 2021, Vietnam’s prime minister asked SBV to study cryptocurrencies and explore a pilot project. It’s unclear what this project entails, but the goal is to “help the government find positive and negative aspects” of cryptocurrencies as it’s an “inevitable trend.”A local news report published last year suggested that the program could lead to a potential issuance of a virtual VND, but unlike the typical digital currencies, its value would still depend on the government’s decision.While this is a promising sign, concrete policies on cryptocurrencies in Vietnam are probably not coming anytime soon. The industry is still waiting for a long-anticipated fintech sandbox.At this early stage, most Southeast Asian governments are also not quite clear about how to regulate cryptocurrencies and other digital assets.Indonesia permits the trading of cryptocurrency but doesn’t recognize it as a form of payment. The Philippines, where Axie Infinity first experienced its meteoric rise, allows the use of virtual currencies “to buy virtual items” or even “real goods from online shops/merchants.”The beauty of Web3 is that it’s the developers’ world. If you have a technical background, the sky’s the limit right now.Singapore has also cautioned people about making responsible decisions on digital investment vehicles such as NFTs and metaverse assets as the country looks to embrace cryptocurrencies in a measured way, Bloomberg reported. The city-state’s central bank also earlier this weekissued guidelines asking crypto trading companies to refrain from advertising their services to the public.Meanwhile, even as they operate within the so-called gray zone, Vietnam’s crypto adopters are still in a “honeymoon phase,” says Nicole Nguyen of Duelist King.Nonetheless, a gray zone can’t protect users and individual investors from scams. But for some local traders, it’s one of the risks worth taking.Other challenges include the crypto market’s self-corrections and the potential effects from the US Federal Reserve’s interest-rate normalization.Still, serious supporters like Nicole hope that the trend would eventually lead to practical use cases of blockchain technologies in Vietnam.Wakabayashi of AppWorks sees the same potential in Vietnam, which has long been known for having a strong pool of technical talent.“Just as we saw in 2018, once this hype cycle passes, those projects with weak fundamentals likely won’t be around after the dust has settled,” he says. “The beauty of Web3 is that it’s the developers’ world. If you have a technical background, the sky’s the limit right now.”","While the country’s young investors are loving crypto for the short-term profits, startups hope this will inspire teams to harness the power of Web3.",162517,Thu Huong Le,True,Terence Lee and Eileen C.

We break down the big and messy topics of Asia’s tech and startup community. Get the newsletter in your inbox everyday with a Premium subscription.Hello reader,Last week, I went for my first cycle as a member of the national military reserve. For those not familiar with this, all Singaporean males are required to undergo 10 cycles of military training after their initial two-year stint as a full-time soldier has been completed.It was a strange feeling experiencing the sights and sounds that were an integral part of my life for a time: the ever-so-slight smell of preservatives in the food, the stale and musky air of the bunks, and the dreaded early mornings.While most of the week was spent on military procedures, what I really appreciated was talking to some of the other servicemen and taking in as many life lessons as I could. Some of what I learned pertained to family, while others were about careers. In any case, it was nice to realize that learning never really stops.Speaking of education, India’s edtech scene is seeing some big moves, as the country’s top players have come together to form a new regulatory body. What will come of it? That’s for you to find out in our premium story for today.Today we look at,Whether the formation of an organic regulatory body is enough to stave off government intervention in the Indian edtech space. Livestreaming firm BeLive getting a US$4.5 million boost.Other newsy highlights such as PUBG: Battlegrounds developer Krafton taking on Garena, Google, and Apple, as well as fresh capital for beauty social commerce firm Raena.Premium summaryWatching the watchmenImage credit: Timmy LoenThe saying “who watches the watchmen?” is often used to describe the issue of governing or regulating those in power. In India, the country’s major edtech players are looking to solve this problem with the creation of a self-regulatory body known as the Indian Edtech Consortium (IEC).Edtech, assemble: Companies such as Byju’s, Unacademy, upGrad, Vedantu, and Simplilearn make up the IEC. The development comes as the industry grapples with several issues, prompting the country’s education ministry to announce that it would be working on its own regulatory policy for the sector.Monkey see, monkey do?: Many of India’s concerns about edtech have also come amid China’s crackdowns on its own edtech industry. Following new regulations, edtech companies in China have had to lay off hundreds or even thousands of employees in a bid to stay compliant. The crackdowns have “spooked” edtech startups and investors in India, according to Siddarth Pai, founding partner of 3one4 Capital.Positive examples: Edtech is not the first industry in India to take a stab at self-regulation. The country’s advertising sector has been using its own regulatory framework since 1985, allowing it to avoid government regulation. Should the IEC be able to follow this example, edtech firms could see accelerated market opportunities while protecting learners and other stakeholders at the same time.Read more: Why Indian edtech’s self-regulation move won’t stop govt interventionStartup spotlightBelieving in BeLiveCo-Founders Lim Kim Hui (L) and Kenneth Tan/ Photo credit: BeLive.Livestreaming has truly boomed over the last few years, though personally, I’m not entirely sure what it is about the content format that makes it so entertaining. Perhaps it’s the live interactions that one can get by chatting with the streamer or just seeing something live instead of plain old television shows. Regardless, Singapore-based BeLive, which provides livestreaming solutions, is looking to capitalize on the phenomenon after bagging US$4.5 million in fresh funding.The rundown: Currently, BeLive provides live shopping, video analysis, and interactive livestreaming services for firms, with more than 100 million viewers already recorded worldwide. In June last year, it was responsible for launching Z-Live, an in-app livestreaming platform for fashion ecommerce startup Zalora. The platform allows Zalora to interact and receive direct payments from its customers in real time.New hires: The company is now looking to use the new funds to hire more staff on top of its existing team of 80 to 100 employees. In particular, it’s looking to hire for roles in business development, customer service, and tech. With this, the firm will be able to expand local operations in overseas markets such as the US, Europe, and the Middle East.Intelligent solutions: Apart from growing its team and expanding overseas, the firm wants to allocate some of its new capital toward developing AI and machine learning capabilities in livestreaming. It’s looking to partner with ecommerce giants, apps, and brands to help it in this initiative.Calling Southeast Asia’s female foundersWhat’s it like being a female founder in Southeast Asia?

You know, oftentimes the way to analogize this for better or for worse is that the purchase of shares when an investor is coming in, you know, through what is usually a subscription agreement or a purchase agreement, right?Kind of different names for the same thing is the way to think about that is that’s the wedding, the shareholder’s agreement is your marriage.

Everything from, sure, figure out your valuation, to kind of prepare the materials, both legal, but more importantly, business-related diligence materials that investors are going to look at.Start the courtship with investors, the whole dating game, if you will. Which can go on for quite a while in the management meetings and then you get yourself into term sheet negotiation.So on this slide or for these next few minutes, I want to talk about pitfalls associated with where this shareholder’s agreement fits in.Because while it’s signed all the way at the end, when closing occurs and the champagne is popped or the coffee is had.The reality is that the negotiations for it and that foundation, if you will, the cement is starting to be made much earlier in the process.Never negotiate solo:Pitfall number one is that never negotiate a term sheet solo. Yes, they are non-binding, except for a couple of provisions. But in reality, the truth is that after you have gone through those first three bullets which can go for months, right?In terms of the courtship in the dating with investors, you finally got a lead investor. You’ve put together a round of folks and all of a sudden now you’ve got a term sheet, which of course has exclusivity provisions, which means you can’t date or you can’t be talking to other potential investors outside of the round that you’ve put together. You could easily go 45-60 days, and if you decide this really sucks, it’s hard to redo that process.And so pitfall number one is that again, related to the shareholder’s agreement because the term sheet actually is like the vertebrate or the backbone of what ultimately the term sheet or with the shareholder’s agreement will have.It’s, you know, these things can be anywhere from a few pages to upwards of 10-14 pages.Never negotiate that solo.Buffer more time:Pitfall number two that occurs and you’ll see this when we talk about timeline right again related to a shareholders agreement, which is always estimate more time. You would do this in any other business or project or strategic initiative that you would undertake for your business.Always buffer way more time than what you think. Anyone telling you that they can get a shareholders agreement done in just a couple of weeks or get docs done in a couple of weeks, amazing, if you can. But the vast majority of these rounds can take anywhere from one to three months from when you signed a term sheet to when closing occurs, you assign the shareholders agreement, the term sheet becomes the shareholder’s agreement and capital is wired to you.So again, if you get it done faster, amazing. If not, you want to make sure that you buffer time.Get experienced counsel:Pitfall number three, I’m just going to say it in ten seconds, which is get experienced counsel to do your fundraise.The example that I give is that look like, you know, we’re smart lawyers and you know, my 350 partners, the 1400 lawyers across the firm with various specialties related to VC.We know what we’re good at. We know what we don’t do, right? You want to finance a power plant in wherever, I’m not and we are not the right firm for you.If you are doing a fundraise involving any technology or venture capital-backed company.We are the, you know, we are pretty good at that. Let me just say that or we are the most experienced. The analogy that I give folks is that, if you have a brain tumor, as tragic as that would be going to a heart surgeon is not the right option, right?Heart surgeons are amazing. They could probably figure it out if they studied up enough time. But odds are you probably want to go to a brain surgeon. And so that is the analogy that I would make, because oftentimes, you know, we see that companies, as we start working with them later on, have worked with counsel that’s a little bit inexperienced or advisors that are inexperienced.Key terms vs standard terms:A typical shareholders’ agreement is 60 to 100 plus pages we prefer they’re much shorter, unfortunately, they tend to go unnecessarily longer and there is no Cliffs Notes version of it.And so my point here is that what is important, particularly for early-stage founders, is that you got it – not only do you need to get it right upfront, but you need to focus on “key ROI terms”.It’s important to know what are key terms to focus on versus what our standard or market standard terms on which should be lower ROI and relying upon the fact that hundreds upon hundreds of thousands of fundraisers over the last 30-40 years have built kind of a market understanding of what is common.Standard terms:These are not unimportant terms. They actually are very key. Anything in a contract, a lawyer telling you that, hey, that’s not important, don’t worry about it. It would be remiss in doing that.At the same time, many of the provisions that you see up here, things like anti-dilution rights, conversion rights, you know, what are the information rights that investors get?And you can use this to your benefit when negotiating with your lead investors to say that look, 20% of the last, you know, fundraises over the last five years have this provision.Why are we rotating over on this one and, you know, kind of flip positional leverage to your benefit?Leverage market precedence:What you see here on this table are examples of, less aggressive in terms of more founder favorable and investor neutral positions all the way to more aggressive or investor favorable provisions.And this is the type of data where the type of information with specific percentages Again, it arms you up to negotiate better. Oftentimes in shareholders agreements, you’ll see that people, the investors will negotiate a hard-wired exit rights which say that’s, you know, say, five to seven years after our investment.The company must deliver an exit, failing which, the investors have certain rights to be able to force or effect a sale or an IPO of the company. If, however, they become more contentious versions of a drag along This is a perfect example of where using market standard terms to benefit you to say, listen, it’s a series A funded company. Are we really talking about scenarios where we are going to drag the business out from underneath the founders and we are negotiating that in our shareholders’ agreement today about things we’re going to do five, six, seven years from now?Why can’t we deal with that a little bit further?It’s a perfect example of where over-rotating on rights associated with scenarios where we may forcibly sell the business in year two or three, probably worthwhile to just leverage market precedent goes to really go or wherever it may be as your advisor on how to just leverage market precedent to just move past some of these lower ROI points.","Ferish Patel, partner-in-charge at Cooley’s Singapore office, takes us through the legal jargon of a shareholders’ agreement.",172100,Melvin Chen,True,Nathaniel Fetalvero,0,"['Premium Content', 'TIA Originals', 'Videos']","['Cooley', 'ferish patel', 'shareholder agreement', 'TIA Originals', 'workshop']",False,,True,True,True,True,6

Patamar Capital, angel investor Oliver Jung, and existing investors such as Golden Gate Ventures, Venturra Discovery, Hustle Fund, iSeed SEA, and DoorDash executive Gokul Rajaram also participated in the round.The investment boosts Mio’s total funding raised to US$9.1 million.Mio founders / Photo credit: MioFounded in June 2020, Mio uses a network of resellers to sell fresh produce such as fruit, vegetables, and meat. The company was set up by former IDG Ventures associateTrung Huynh, Scommerce co-founder An Pham, ex-DigiPay executive Tu Le, and former Uber Vietnam operations lead Long Pham.Around a year after its inception, when the company raised a US$1 million seed round, it had 150 active resellers. Today, that number has grown by 10x to 1,500. Mio’s gross merchandise value (GMV) has also increased by more than 50x in the last 12 months.Huynh credits the company’s growth to its referral programs, which offer a fee to resellers who can onboard other people to the platform. Existing resellers also get additional bonuses if the individual they refer performs well. In a statement, Mio said that each reseller can earn up to US$400 from these referral bonuses as well as from the 10% commission they get for every order they facilitate.“We spend very little in marketing. We don’t use digital marketing or billboards – we focus on the referral,” Huynh told Tech in Asia.Mio has around 240 employees, an increase of 5x since May last year. Around 50% of its headcount consists of its operational taskforce who work in the company’s warehouses and fulfillment centers.Doubling down on the social commerce modelMio plans to use the fresh funding to put up more fulfillment centers and tap into new cities in Vietnam. It currently covers Ho Chi Minh and its satellite cities, such as Binh Duong, Dong Nai, and Long An, which are located in the southern region of the country. This year, it plans to enter the northern region, where the country’s capital city of Hanoi is located.“Hanoi has similarities with Ho Chi Minh, and it also has several satellite cities. We aim to be present in 10 cities by the end of 2022,” Huynh noted.Mio app / Image credit: MioThe company also wants to improve its logistics and supply chain, which Huynh said is important for Mio in the long run. That’s why the company prefers to control fulfillment centers and the delivery process itself. Today, its delivery courier can handle almost 80% of the company’s total transactions.“During the time when the order is spiked, or there is a special event, we cooperate with third-party logistics,” Huynh said.The company currently sells more than 10,000 products every day, and it targets to fulfill 100,000 orders per day by the end of 2022.See also: These startups could unlock ecommerce’s true potential in IndonesiaHuynh revealed that he sees interest from businesses in the hotel, restaurant, and cafe sector that want to source fresh produce from his company in bulk due to the attractive prices. With the pressure to increase GMVs after raising a significant amount of funding, Huynh finds the offers tempting.However, he consistently rejects such requests to keep the company focused on using its reseller network and reaching customers nationwide.Mio has expanded its offerings to FMCG products due to requests from its customers. However, these offerings only occupy around 10% of Mio’s total stock keeping units. Huynh explained that while FMCG products are easier for fulfillment – as they typically have a longer shelf life than other categories – they bring lower margins.“Majority of our GMV still comes from fresh produce, so it will still be our focus,” Huynh added.","Mio currently has more than 1,500 active resellers and saw its GMV grow 50x in the past 12 months.",86192,Aditya Hadi Pratama,True,Collin Furtado and Lorenzo Kyle Subido,0,"['Ecommerce', 'Investments', 'News', 'Startups']","['an pham', 'Jungle Ventures', 'long pham', 'mio', 'Patamar Capital', 'Social Commerce', 'trung huynh', 'tu le', 'Vietnam']",False,,True,False,True,False,3

We break down the big and messy topics of Asia’s tech and startup community. Get the newsletter in your inbox everyday with a Premium subscription.Hello reader,Fairy tales, movies, and books keep us steeped in the savior narrative. Some of last year’s box office juggernauts such as Spider-Man: No Way Home and Dune play to our never-ending fascination with a hero who swoops in to save the day. However, sometimes we forget to draw the line between fiction and reality.In real life, things are more complicated: Even good intentions may have negative outcomes. The savior complex – or white knight syndrome – is defined as the need to “save” people by attempting to fix their problems. It’s an issue that negatively affects countless people. Those with a savior complex may experience frustration, loss of control, resentment, and a sense of failure, among other  unpleasant emotions.Usually, most of us don’t need a “savior” – we learn to deal with life’s problems by focusing on the actions in our control and accepting the ones we can’t control. However, occasionally, as in UangTeman’s case, there is a desperate need for a white knight. Today, we see how the Jakarta-based online lender could be saved from the brink of collapse.Today we look at,How troubled UangTeman may have found a lifelineThe birth of yet another unicorn in IndiaOther newsy highlights such as eye-popping funding rounds and Twitter’s new SEA headPremium summaryMore than a helping handImage credit: Timmy LoenUangTeman is in dire need of capital. After having stopped disbursing loans – its sole business – since the early days of the pandemic, the company hasn’t paid employees’ salaries since the end of 2020, and may be criminally liable for nonpayment of employee income taxes and social security.The embattled startup is not in good shape but behold, IN Financial Technologies Holdings, which has come to the rescue as a potential acquirer and white knight in UangTeman’s story.Signed, and sealed, but not yet delivered: While the two firms signed a term sheet on December 24, 2021, it is not a done deal yet. According to the timeline laid out in the letter, due diligence is slated to start this month, with the acquisition process set to be completed by April 1, 2022. As part of the acquisition process, UangTeman is seeking to extend its lending license from Otoritas Jasa Keuangan (OJK), Indonesia’s financial services authority.One promise too many: Given the online lender’s previously unfulfilled promises, former UangTeman employees remain skeptical about whether the deal will go through. “I don’t think it makes sense that due diligence is scheduled for three months. One month should be enough for a company whose main operation – [loan] disbursement – has stopped since April 2020,” said an ex-staffer.Boiling point: Several UangTeman ex-employees have also signed a letter seeking an audience with Bambang Budiawan, OJK’s head of oversight for non-bank financial institutions, on Friday, January 14. One source said that, should the meeting fall through, some former  staffers may consider holding a demonstration at the OJK offices.Read more: Troubled UangTeman finds potential buyer, seeks OJK license extensionStartup spotlightLeading by exampleImage credit: Timmy LoenLead (formerly Lead School) became India’s first edtech unicorn in 2022 after it scored US$100 million in a series E round at a valuation of US$1.1 billion.

728987,2022-01-17T08:00:58,2022-01-17T07:50:15,Is Asia ready for Sequoia’s perpetual fund model?,asia-ready-sequoias-perpetual-fund-model,post,"It’s one thing for a VC firm to say that the 10-year fund cycle – the typical time period a fund has to invest and make returns – has become obsolete, but it’s quite another matter when the firm in question is Sequoia Capital.Roelof Botha, a partner at the startup investment giant, penned an essay last October announcing the company’s “boldest innovation yet” – The Sequoia Fund.Instead of a 10-year window for VCs to invest and ultimately return capital to their limited partners (LPs), the Sequoia Fund offers an “open-ended liquid portfolio” in a selection of Sequoia-backed companies. This means LPs can participate in a company’s fundraise at any time from inception to IPO and beyond.Photo credit: Sequoia CapitalThis is a sea change in Sequoia’s modus operandi, but as Botha wrote, the model is currently limited to its businesses in the US and Europe. For the time being, it excludes the firm’s operations in India, China, and Southeast Asia, where its portfolio companies include the likes of Gojek, JD.com, and Oyo.It’s unclear why Asia is currently excluded or what the plan is moving forward (Sequoia India declined to comment). But based on conversations with VCs across Southeast Asia and India, one explanation is that Asia’s startup scene simply isn’t ready for a perpetual or longer-term funding model.“Our ecosystem is so young,” says a representative from a venture capital firm that invests in Southeast Asia, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.Impatient capital, impermanent companies?It’s worth noting that evergreen funds, which go on indefinitely, do exist.“In many ways, large family offices and endowments are evergreen funds,” says the venture capital representative who asked to remain anonymous. “The main difference is just that it’s Sequoia that’s the fund manager now.”It’s similar to how SPACs, which use the same methods as reverse mergers or backdoor listings, are merely a new name for an old concept.At the same time, however, the perpetual fund model that Sequoia is proposing – at least for now – is foreign to venture capital. In his essay, Sequoia’s Botha pointed out how perpetual funding would remove the “rigid” and “artificial” 10-year funding horizon that has been used since the 1970s, a model that Botha described as “the business equivalent of floppy disks.”Exposure to venture investments means the promise of larger gains.“For me personally, [the new fund model is] not revolutionary – it’s evolutionary,” said Michael Blakey of Cocoon Capital in an episode of Unreasonable, a podcast he co-hosts with fellow investors Hian Goh and Vishal Harnal. “I think the one thing they’ve said that I think is really true is that nobody has really looked at how to change the VC model.”Harnal, who is a managing partner at 500 Southeast Asia, added that the 10-year cycle may have been based on how long it took to take a company public back in the 1960s or 1970s – when venture capital was born.In an article written on freelance platform Toptal, venture capital consultant Alex Graham echoes Botha’s major points. Open-ended or perpetual funds can truly focus on “long-term capital appreciation,” as they have no end date and can continuously raise capital, he said.Endowment funds of universities like Harvard are an example of evergreen funds / Photo credit: Wikimedia CommonsWhile there are benefits to this model – such as an alignment with long-term sustainable growth or the flexibility to adjust investment theses – there are also drawbacks. One of them, according to Graham, is illiquidity.Endowment funds, for instance, are structured so that they can earn dividends and other investment income (while leaving the principal amount untouched). But investors in an evergreen venture fund cannot expect a similar regular cash payout, as startups generally don’t disburse dividends.At the same time, exposure to venture investments means the promise of larger gains. In the US, venture capital funds rose by a median 88.1% between June 2020 to June 2021, according to estimates from investment firm Cambridge Associates. That’s a substantially higher rate compared to, say, Harvard University’s endowment fund, whose 33.6% return for 2021 was already unprecedented.The caveat, however, is that evergreen VC funds are still relatively rare.A more important comparison, perhaps, is between evergreen VC funds and traditional VC funds. For his article, Graham looked into data from PitchBook and found that returns were largely similar from a total value to paid in (TVPI) standpoint. But there was some divergence when the TVPI was broken down into its two components: residual value to paid in (RVPI) and distributed to paid in (DPI).Evergreen VC funds have higher RVPI, which means they accumulate higher returns over a longer period of time. However, they have lower DPI, showing that returns are slower to be distributed back to LPs. For traditional VC funds, the two figures are more closely aligned.The caveat, however, is that evergreen VC funds are still relatively rare. Based on the data he found, Graham estimated that there were 200 evergreen VC funds globally – a tiny fraction of the 10,000 VC funds worldwide that are classified as “venture capital” funds on Crunchbase.Too early for Asia?So, would a perpetual fund structure be game-changing and relevant for Asian VC funds? Or is the ecosystem still too young to adopt it?In his essay announcement, Botha said Sequoia’s funding of tech innovators “taught us that [such companies] take more than a few years to build.”“In recent years, many of our most promising companies have chosen to stay private longer, building scale and expanding their strategic footprint before debuting as public-market leaders,” he explained.Botha was mostly referring to Silicon Valley powerhouses like Apple, Google, Unity, and Zoom. But he also said that these companies compound their advantage for decades, with “much of their value accruing long after an IPO.” That last point may hold relevance for Asia now, considering more tech startups from the region are going public.A few solid pros are more powerful than a dozen cons.“Before the pandemic, we saw how many tech unicorns in the Asia region – and even globally – continued to raise increasingly massive mega rounds in an effort to support their rapid growth without having to go public,” says Yinglan Tan, founding managing partner at Insignia Ventures Partners and formerly a partner at Sequoia Capital India. However, “this effort to stay private as long as possible shifted 180 degrees as the pandemic hit,” he adds.Sandeep Murthy, partner at Indian VC firm Lightbox Ventures, finds the permanent capital model to be appealing. He also points out that Sequoia’s open-ended fund lets it invest in “category-creating” companies, which can often take longer than 10 years to become exit-ready.“As Steve Jobs once said, a few solid pros are more powerful than a dozen cons,” he quotes.Sequoia partner Roelof Botha, who penned the Sequoia Fund essay / Photo credit: Sequoia CapitalWhen Lightbox Ventures started, it too aimed to eventually adopt a similar structure. But Murthy says doing so would call into question the very nature of venture capital itself.“Is it still a high-risk, high-return asset class that is based on small amounts of capital returning large sums?” Murthy asks. “Or are we now looking at venture capital as a diversified, moderate risk asset class that will merge high-risk returns with high-growth, low-risk bets to give overall more predictable outcomes?”Plus, making the change to a perpetual fund structure may be less of a challenge in a bear market, such as now, Murthy says. With the global economy recovering from the worst of the pandemic, company valuations seem to move only in one direction: up.Sequoia is doing this because they can.“The test for the model will be when there is a downturn, and people have to deal with the change in private values impacting their position in what they thought was a liquid, easy-to-value asset,” he explains.Nonetheless, 500 Southeast Asia’s Harnal speculated in the podcast episode that the reason Sequoia chose not to adopt the model in Asia for now may be a simple one:“If I’m sitting in their shoes, I may not necessarily want to start by having all my funds across all markets come under this structure,” he said. “I first want to see how it goes: let’s start with two, see how that progresses, and if it works, then let’s expand it over.”The holy grailAll that aside, the Southeast Asia-centric VC representative we spoke to finds that, ultimately, it is the fund manager – rather than the startups – who benefits more from employing an evergreen fund structure.“This is just another way to get ‘permanent capital,’” says the representative. “Sequoia is doing this because they can. Evergreen capital is like the holy grail for many fund managers. It’s a load off if you don’t have to keep raising 10-year funds.”In the bigger picture, though, this talk of employing an open-ended model might not matter all that much. First off, the representative explains, it will be harder for Asian VCs to adopt the fund model: Not every firm has Sequoia’s track record or its resources.Second, startups sign on with Sequoia for its brand – not necessarily the structure it uses, adds the representative.Plus, even without a perpetual fund structure, founders today have more fundraising options on the table, such as continuation funds or funds that specialize in secondary shares.Photo credit: ake1150 / 123RF On the other hand, a perpetual fund may also be the natural next step for VCs as Asia’s startup scene matures. A paper by the European Corporate Governance Institute found that “more reputable” VCs tend to have a longer involvement in their portfolio firms, even after they IPO, and this translates to better long-term performances by the companies they’ve invested in.As Harnal pointed out in the podcast, recent market forces may also make the evergreen structure more popular. Chief among these factors is the increasingly blurred lines between hedge funds, private equity, growth funds, or venture capital.“You win at a game like this by ensuring that you have access to capital in the way you want to invest it, being able to pounce on it without friction, and at the speed at which you want to do it,” he explained. “You can iterate and spin up new products, you can invest in new opportunities, without necessarily being beholden to a fund structure or where in the capital line you invest.”","Asia isn’t included in Sequoia’s permanent fund plans, but a recent wave of tech IPOs may signal a growing relevance for the fund structure in the region.",656243,Rachel Chia,False,Putra Muskita and Jaclyn Tiu,0,"['Analysis', 'Premium Content']","['analysis', 'funds', 'investments', 'Premium content', 'Sequoia Capital', 'VC', 'venture capital']",False,,True,True,True,False,8

Does it speak of a rapidly rising star who can’t be held down in one place for a significant amount of time? Or does it indicate someone with a  fickle mind?My opinion? There’s probably too much that goes into these personal decisions to paint things in black or white. But when it comes to C-level departures, things might be a little more complicated. For instance, two executives appear to be leaving the Malaysian Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC) after less than a year at the government agency.Today, we look at:The impending C-suite changes at MDECThe startup that raised US$82 million to help other people get the money that’s owed to them Other newsy highlights such as a Singapore mental wellness startup’s team-up with Microsoft and a bunch of successful funding roundsPremium summarySubbing in, subbing outImage credit: Timmy LoenIn many of the articles I write, it’s hard not to mention how we’re now operating in a digital-first environment; the pandemic has instituted changes that are here to stay.Obviously, governments play a very important role in enabling the continued development of our respective digital economies. As such, the news that two MDEC executives are leaving after less than a year in their respective roles might cause some eyebrows to raise.The pair in question: Aiza Azreen Ahmad has resigned as chief digital business officer, according to sources, while it is understood that chief financial officer Nora Junita Hussaini is serving her notice period.No 12 months: The executives who quit had worked at the agency for less than a year. Aiza joined in March after a three-month stint as CEO of Pertama Digital, a govtech company listed on Bursa Malaysia. Nora Junita, a chartered accountant, joined MDEC last year on January 21.Replacement: MDEC has brought in Ashran Ghazi, the former CEO of Malaysian Global Innovation &amp; Creativity Centre, as a contract-for-service consultant.Read more: C-suite changes on the cards at MDEC: sourcesStartup spotlightRefyning that investor pitchRefyne cofounders Chitresh Sharma &amp; Apoorv Kumar / Photo credit: RefyneRefyne, an earned wage access (EWA) platform based in India, has raised US$82 million in a series B round led by Tiger Global, with new investor Digital Horizon also joining in.Others who participated in this round include QED Investors, Jigsaw VC, XYZ Capital, RTP Global, and partners of DST Global.Unrivaled?: Refyne claims to have pioneered EWA services in India, giving employees an option to access accrued income (or income they’ve already earned) without having to wait for payday.Solving the problem: The platform addresses a specific pain point: In India, 81% of employees experience shortages in their finances in between paydays.Big money: With the latest round, Refyne has raised US$106 million in total to date.

728331,2022-01-14T04:40:32,2022-01-24T04:20:14,Why Indian edtech’s self-regulation move won’t stop govt intervention,indian-edtech-selfregulation-move-wont-stop-govt-intervention,post,"Top Indian edtech players such as Byju’s, Unacademy, upGrad, Vedantu, and Simplilearn have come together to form a self-regulatory body called the Indian Edtech Consortium (IEC).Photo credit: 123rf.comFormed under the aegis of the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI), the consortium aims to make online education more accessible to all.The formation of the IEC comes at a time when the Indian edtech industry is plagued with cases of bad behavior and predatory pricing, so much that these cases have reached the Indian Parliament.Last week, the country’s education ministry said that it would be working out a regulation policy for the edtech industry, which has boomed amid the pandemic. There were reports that edtech companies were exploiting students with loans for fee-based courses.“Students should not be lured to take loans by false promises from [edtech firms],” said the Indian Education Minister at the time.An industry insider tells Tech in Asia on the condition of anonymity that the IEC was formed in response to this announcement by the government.“In order to have the power to negotiate with the government, you need to have all the constituents on board as one voice rather than separate voices,” says the person.However, the IAMAI denies this, saying that the framework had been in the works for the past six months. “This is nowhere in anyway a response to what the government is doing around edtech,” Bhanupreet Saini, head of public policy at IAMAI, tells Tech in Asia.See also: Byju’s aims to be profitable by FYE 2022 despite acquisition spreeConcerns of going the China routeRegardless of when the framework for the self-regulatory body started, some see the timing of the announcement as a sign that edtech firms in the country are concerned. This is especially the case after China, a neighboring country to India, took a hard stand on its US$48 billion edtech sector.The country introduced regulations turning these education firms into non-profit organizations, putting restrictions on foreign investment, and forbidding firms in the segment to go public, among other measures.See also: Inside China’s crusade against the education sector’s excessesThe aftershocks of this crackdown are still being felt in China. Just this week, New Oriental, an online tutoring firm in the country, said it laid off 60,000 employees. Even TikTok parent firm ByteDance reportedly fired hundreds of employees working on its edtech platforms in August 2021.“Education is a sensitive subject for any government, and the Chinese crackdown has spooked startups and investors alike,” Siddarth Pai, founding partner of 3one4 Capital, tells Tech in Asia. An organization like the IEC, he adds, would facilitate dialogue on regulations and become a forum to grow edtech in a sustainable way.With the Indian national elections coming in the next two years – and several other key state elections happening this year – the government is unlikely to turn a blind eye to the social issues that affect voters from more vulnerable sections of the society.“Growth at all costs cannot be the motto, especially in this space,” says Ankur Bansal, co-founder and director of alternative credit firm BlackSoil.Photo credit: 123rf.comThe Indian education ministry tells Tech in Asia that it hopes the consortium would be able to adhere to the self-regulatory code of conduct that they have set out for themselves. A ministry spokesperson clarified, however, that the department is already working on an advisory on edtech, which will reiterate the existing laws surrounding ecommerce in the country under the Consumer Protection Act.“In course of time, edtech players will also have to abide by data protection laws and other such laws which are concerned with consumer protection and data privacy,” the spokesperson adds.A mature industry?The last two years have seen a meteoric rise in online education in India, with billions of dollars in funding flowing in from global and domestic investors. The sector is well on its way to becoming a US$4 billion market by 2025.Industry experts say that the time is right to form a regulatory body for the maturing industry, as it will allow market participants to provide their products and services in a fair environment. Several other mature industries such as advertising already follow a self-regulatory code of conduct.The country’s advertising sector set up the self-regulatory body – called the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) – in 1985, and it has managed to stave off government intervention in regulating the industry. In fact, edtech companies are reportedly already consulting the ASCI to get their regulatory framework right.Some, like Vedanta CEO Vamsi Krishna,see the IEC as a crucial step toward protecting learners, as more students, teachers, and stakeholders become a part of the online education ecosystem. Establishing a common code of conduct and putting together a mechanism to address grievances will be important moving forward.“With the sole purpose of improving the delivery of education services, it is now crucial for us to foster and sustain stakeholder trust by safeguarding the consumer’s interest as a practice,” Mayank Kumar, co-founder and managing director of upGrad and co-chairperson of the IAMAI edtech committee, tells Tech in Asia.Representatives from Unacademy and Simplilearn declined to comment.See also: Indian edtech startup hopes to shake up lifelong learning in Southeast AsiaWhile self-regulation is a good first step, formal government guidelines will accelerate the market opportunity, says Sanjay Mehta, founder and partner at 100X VC, an early-stage VC fund based in India.“Hence for a maturing industry like edtech, what is required is a regulator like how the Reserve Bank of India (the country’s central bank) works closely with fintech companies, giving them regular guidelines on engagement,” adds Mehta.",The formation of the Indian Edtech Consortium comes at a time when the government is mulling over an edtech regulation policy.,589814,Samreen Ahmad,True,Collin Furtado and Jaclyn Tiu,0,"['Analysis', 'News', 'Premium Content']","['byju’s', 'China edtech', 'edtech', 'iamai', 'India', 'Indian edtech', 'self regulation', 'Simplilearn', 'unacademy', 'UpGrad', 'Vedantu']",False,,True,True,True,False,4
727576,2022-01-14T04:00:27,2022-01-14T04:22:01,Meet the platform that’s encouraging digital and financial inclusion in Southeast Asia,meet-platform-encouraging-digital-financial-inclusion-southeast-asia,post,"Digitalization has taken Southeast Asia by storm, and it’s been helped in no small measure by the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2020 alone, the region saw a 9.9% growth in internet users, taking the total number to 463 million websurfers.However, while aggregated statistics and anecdotes paint a promising picture, full digital and financial inclusion remains elusive. Though Singapore took the top spot in the 2021 Roland Berger Digital Inclusion Index, other Southeast Asian countries crowded into the bottom half. This is because of the “accessibility disconnect,” which is what happens when user habits outpace infrastructure growth.Shareit, an online and offline digital content platform, wants to tear down the barriers to digital inclusion in emerging markets and provide access to the underserved.The questions of accessibility and affordabilityIn its earliest days, Shareit focused on building a cross platform file sharing app, which then evolved into an online and offline file sharing, content streaming, and gaming platform.Additionally, it’s “a powerful, open ecosystem with apps from many developers,” says Karam Malhotra, partner and global vice president of Shareit Group. “Shareit unlocks the ability for many types of phones to share many types of content without the need for an internet connection or mobile data consumption and is downloadable for free.”This was a key focus for the firm, with users’ data demands growing exponentially.“Before, people were happy to play a 10MB game. Now, they’re not happy playing anything less than a 1GB game,” he says. “It went from Nokia’s Snake to Call of Duty. The amount of data users required grew by 100x.”Photo credit: Trung Vo ChiMalhotra adds that the quality of mobile internet connectivity remains poor in emerging countries, and people there also worry about the high cost of mobile data consumption. These challenges around downloading content from the internet have shut people out from participating fully in the digital economy. An alternative for sharing content and apps would make a difference.Tapping into human proclivities“Shareit’s growth is built on the principle that sharing makes people feel good, which is facilitated by our high-quality user experience and word of mouth marketing,” Malhotra says.This organic foundation strongly drove adoption. While Shareit was launched as a simple file-sharing platform, the team realized it was becoming a trusted source of referrals in underserved communities, becoming one of the fastest growing apps globally. To date, nearly 2.4 billion users have installed Shareit Group’s diversified suite of applications.“Near-distance peer-to-peer is the world’s largest offline-online social ecosystem,” Malhotra says. “Shareit enables a digital economy we don’t even know about.”Peer-to-peer sharing helps in another way: word-of-mouth is the fastest way to build trust. In fact, a study by Google​ shows that most people discover new apps through friends and family.Malhotra says shared conversation is key to facilitating this trust. “Every popular game has at least 30 imitators,” he points out. “How do you know which is the legitimate one that doesn’t have viruses, malware, or spyware? You ask your friend.”Peer-to-peer sharing also organically improves digital literacy as friends trust and teach each other about how apps work. This, in turn, leads to financial inclusion. Malhotra points to how people getting used to ecommerce has also led to increased usage of and faith in e-wallets like Alipay or GCash.Serving the underservedDuring the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Digital Inclusion Index points out that aid and credible information could not reach the low-income and less educated demographic that is not online. The digital divide, therefore, is costly in many ways.In this respect, the Shareit team felt a responsibility to help the underserved access the right apps and products during pandemic-induced lockdowns. For example, the firm helped spread awareness of the Philippines government’s national vaccination program via digital content sharing within the app, racking up 100 million impressions.“People were sharing a lot more in their communities. We knew we had so many more eyeballs on the system,” says Malhotra.As a foundational “plumbing” piece of Southeast Asia’s digital infrastructure, Shareit now helps ecommerce players understand and reach underserved consumers and digital banks in order to reach the unbanked.“One of the biggest ways we really helped fintech and ecommerce companies like GCash and Shopee was to achieve true financial inclusion in mass markets,” Malhotra shares, also pointing out that the firm curates campaigns to help brands reach out to an incremental and almost untapped audience.Photo credit: Shareit GroupTo do this, Shareit emphasizes its localization efforts, analyzing the cultural background and language environment of a target market and adapting the app’s design, interaction, and functionality accordingly. It also invests in local teams and talents to meet clients’ demands as best it can.Tapping into over 700 global advertisers and their existing user bases, Shareit also helps its clients with awareness campaigns, user acquisition, digital payment options, and seamless user monetization via extensive audience networks. Clients can then reinvest the revenue into further user acquisition – Malhotra refers to this virtuous cycle as the “flywheel” model.Digital inclusion is an imperativeAs much as 80% of Southeast Asia’s internet users have made at least one purchase online, with 60 million new users joining the internet economy since Covid-19 hit, according to the e-Conomy SEA report 2021.Besides ecommerce – and the related e-wallets – the online media, travel, and transport sectors are all likely to grow.Younger adults are the fastest adopters and are likely to become the economic core and growth driver of digital services. Enabling digital and financial inclusion will allow this key demographic to contribute efficiently to the economy and improve social cohesion as well.“I think Asia will mature in the next five years – everything will be built around sharing,” Malhotra says, pointing to the success of social commerce and group buying in China.“Similarly, on the fintech side, there’s so much we can do to educate people more and make them aware of the opportunities available to them via digital currencies.”Shareit Group is dedicated to building high-quality content platforms where it connects users and content globally.

Delivered every Thursday via email and through the Tech in Asia website, this free newsletter breaks down the biggest stories and trends in ecommerce. If you’re not a subscriber, get access by registering here.Hi there,I spend a lot of time scanning through reviews of products I’d like to buy and, TBH, sometimes the comments don’t help at all.I like to think that’s why live commerce grew popular in the first place: You could just ask the person on your screen all your earth-shaking questions about the shirt they were selling.I must confess there’s a reason I bring up shirts. I’m on the hunt for one, preferably black, and it turns out that Flipkart’s Myntra – my go-to shopping site – has 6,500 different black shirts for women. Can you really fault me for being picky?A gentle nudge from a live streamer might have really helped in this scenario. Understandably, entrepreneurs and analysts believe live commerce might be just what’s needed to bring new customers to ecommerce. Given that only about 100 million of India’s 700 million internet users shop online in India, live commerce has its work cut out.And with all that in mind, my colleague, Samreen, set out to learn whether India’s live commerce scene could replicate the success that the business model found in China. This week’s Big Story takes us along on her expedition.This week, we’ll also dive into what shopping could look like if we removed barriers like our screens and jumped right into the metaverse.— Nikita (Bengaluru, India)THE BIG STORYCan India recreate China’s live commerce magic?Image credit: Timmy LoenIndia’s short-video players and general ecommerce marketplaces are vying to capture the country’s up-and-coming live commerce sector.THE HOT TAKEBuilding a metaverse for retail and ecommerceInside Samsung 837X metaverse on Decentraland. The event featuring Samsung’s metaverse store is over, but visitors continue to sign in.Here’s what happened:Facebook’s rebranding as Meta put the spotlight on the metaverse – a virtual universe that was already in the making.It made people curious about what the metaverse could actually look like.While gaming companies have a head start in the voyage into the metaverse, retailers have begun experimenting with what commerce might look like in the new reality.Here’s our take:Recently, an old video resurfaced, giving us a glimpse of what shopping virtually in Walmart could look like. While the video itself drew mixed reactions, I much prefer Mastercard’s idea of the metaverse.Instead of letting us wander around Walmart’s aisles with a floating torso (which unnervingly knows how much milk I have in the fridge) that pops up every now and then, Mastercard’s version of the metaverse depicts two friends in a park.One of them describes a pair of sneakers that pop into the other’s peripheral vision. The second friend goes on to customize the NFT for her digital avatar while the actual product lands up at her doorstep IRL in a few days.Here’s the twist: The park itself was in the metaverse, and the friends who met up in the park never left their homes.Comparisons aside, here’s what is happening in real time: On the one hand, there are companies already experimenting with merging commerce and gaming. These include Epic Games, Roblox, and Scuti, a retail marketplace where gamers can use their awards to buy real-world products like sneakers or headphones.An image from luxury brand Balenciaga’s collection on Fortnite / Photo credit: Epic Games/ FortniteFor example: Luxury brand Balenciaga’s digital garments are on Fortnite. A Gucci bag sold for US$4,115 on Roblox last year – this bag costs US$3,400 IRL.On the other hand, there’s a new wave of companies building metaverse and VR platforms for different brands like New York-headquartered Obsess.Startups like Obsess that are working in experiential retail could well shore up the investor interest that roll-up brands have seen recently. But there is another way to go about building the metaverse for shopping. For instance, Vietnam-based RFOX (RedFox Labs) is building virtual shopfronts in a virtual marketplace and offering them to retailers.The difference between the two is subtle but substantial: While Obsess makes virtual stores for standalone brands and RFOX offers similar services to its clients, the latter already has a “mall” to set up stores – a virtual marketplace called RFOX Valt.Co-founded by Ben Fairbank, who formerly worked at Grab, RFOX Valt comprises four quarters, featuring a mix of auctionable premium shops, some marquee storefronts, and places earmarked for concerts and events – much like in real-world malls and shopping centers. This past December, RFOX auctioned 25 stores for 291.4891 Ethereum (about US$ 1.2 million).The broader plan is to replicate this virtual marketplace for consumers in the Philippines, Indonesia, and other Southeast Asian countries. But while companies adapt to a metaverse still in the making, the early birds might get the juiciest of worms. Obsess, for instance, has clients like Ralph Lauren and Tommy Hilfiger.And if denizens of the metaverse don’t want to don clothes from a specific brand, they can also design their own NFT wardrobes through projects like The Fabricant Studio, hosted by The Fabricant, a digital fashion house headquartered in Amsterdam.An image from The Fabricant’s collection for Puma/ Photo credit: Kerry Murphy/The FabricantThe company envisions the metaverse as a place where there are cyber materials to choose from, while meta tailors, professional buyers, and multilabel retailers all work together to create decentralized fashion. While the devil is in the details, this trend could take off in Shein-esque fashion. After all, people spend thousands of dollars on virtual clothing – a designer made US$15,000 to $20,000 in just three weeks by selling digital kimonos for about US$140 each.Aside from luxury brands, companies like Samsung are already exploring the new frontier. Samsung jumped into the metaverse with the Samsung 837X, a virtual store modeled after its flagship New York City real-life counterpart. Though this virtual store was a temporary one, the South Korea-based company is likely to take the experience to other platforms. (Its VC arm Samsung Next has already invested in related projects such as The Sandbox, Axie Infinity, etc.)The future of shopping could very well involve digital avatars trying out clothes, shoes, and sunglasses before buying “phygital” goods. Meanwhile, the creation of shopping stores and malls in the metaverse – modeled around those in IRL – seems like an obvious next step, and holds a wealth of unlocked potential.As I tinker with the idea of getting a car, the metaverse could have offered customers like me – who are wary about stepping outdoors amid the Covid-19 pandemic – the chance to test out cars on a Formula One track. After all, the metaverse is all about pushing boundaries and ideas we are familiar with.But the newness of the tech means most glimpses of shopping in the metaverse are purposely only slightly altered versions of reality.That’s why there are no cars floating mid-air in the metaverse yet – it allows people to make a smoother transition to the metaverse. “There is no playbook for brands to have it so far removed from what they have now,” says RFOX’s Fairbank, adding that retailers are hestiant about moving “too far from the conventional showroom.”Businesses at the moment seem to be throwing pebbles into the deep waters of the metaverse, seeing how far the ripples go. Perhaps there really is some wisdom in treading with caution in a world whose building blocks are still coming together. But then again, the metaverse might be just the place for the bold to take chances. After all, what would lure us to a world that’s almost the same as the one we’re already in?— NikitaNEWS YOU SHOULD KNOWCheck out Tech in Asia’s coverage of the ecommerce scene here.1️⃣ Malaysia’s Carsome has raised US$290 million in a round led by 65 Equity Partners, SeaTown Holdings, and Qatar Investment Authority. The round pushes, the car marketplace’s valuation to roughly US$1.7 billion.2️⃣ India-based hyperlocal delivery firm Dunzo has raised US$240 million in a round led by Reliance Retail Ventures. Dunzo plans to use the funds to expand its network of dark stores and bolster its B2B vertical to support logistics services for local merchants in an increasingly competitive market.3️⃣ Online classifieds firm Carousell is in merger talks with blank-check company L Catterton Asia Acquisition Corp to list itself in the US in a deal that will potentially value the joint entity at US$1.5 billion.4️⃣ Grab, the Southeast Asian super app, is testing a new variant of its self-pickup feature that allows users to pre-order certain items and collect them from a common pick-up point in Singapore’s Punggol area. The company has been leaning on its delivery services more than ever after the Covid-19 pandemic hit its transportation and travel business.5️⃣ Indonesia-headquartered J&amp;T Express has expanded its logistics network to the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. The company plans to list on the Hong Kong stock exchange this year.FYIAmazon slips to fourth in global rankings for shopping appsMuch like the metaverse, conventional ecommerce is constantly changing and evolving. So it comes as no surprise that Amazon’s global rank among shopping apps is slipping. Shopee’s feat of becoming the most downloaded app in 2021 isn’t shocking either. Shein nabbing the second spot is also understandable as the fast-fashion firm saw a meteoric rise this year. But coming in third is Meesho. That’s a surprise because, as this report points out, this Indian social commerce app wasn’t even on the radar before 2021.That’s it for this edition – we hope you liked it!

It has a subsidiary called INFT, which bills itself as “Asia’s first community-driven digital business account.” INFT is also registered with the Singapore Fintech Association.Tech in Asia has reached out to UangTeman CEO Aidil Zulkifli and INFT chief executive Eldwin Wong for comment.

He has done it all – from hosting teleshopping episodes to creating short videos. Juneja has recently turned to livestreaming on live commerce platform Roposo, selling fashion products of local brands such as The Man Company and Park Avenue.Photo credit: Unsplash“It’s easy to make a reel for 30 seconds, but when you do a livestream for 30 to 40 minutes, it takes a lot of energy and concentration,” he says.Juneja claims that his monthly income has increased by nearly 30% since he started streaming on Roposo in April 2021.Live commerce, which allows people to shop in real time through video streaming, has opened an additional avenue of livelihood for content creators like Juneja.In June 2020, India bannedChinese-owned TikTok following an escalation of a border dispute between the two countries.Since then, dozens of short-video startups in India have surfaced to capture a slice of what used to be TikTok’s biggest market and capitalize on the country’s fast-growing video consumption.A crowded spaceIndia’s live commerce sector is expected to generate US$4 billion to US$5 billion in gross merchandise value (GMV) by 2025, with live video apps taking up a slightly larger share compared to general ecommerce marketplaces that adopt live commerce capabilities, according to RedSeer Consulting.China’s billion-dollar live commerce sector was built upon the rise of content creators and short-form video consumption. India is witnessing a similar pattern, RedSeer’s research shows, and the country’s influencers are also spotting the opportunity to generate sales from content.According to a Bain &amp; Company report, India’s online video user base has scaled to more than 350 million people, growing at 24% annually from 2018 to 2020 — twice as fast as the equivalent numbers in China and Indonesia.Image credit: Timmy LoenThe nationwide lockdown and additional restrictions amid the pandemic have popularized online shopping in India. As a result, a bunch of short-video and social commerce startups have either rolled out their own livestreaming feature or partnered with ecommerce giants to launch them.“As companies try to make online commerce reach into the smaller cities of India, they realize that the traditional ecommerce model may not work, and they need to have a video interface. This seems to be the right time to draw upon video commerce to reach the next 300 million to 400 million new ecommerce users,” Mrigank Gutgutia, associate partner at RedSeer, tells Tech in Asia.Filling the gap in lower-tier citiesIndia currently has nearly 700 million internet users, but only about 100 million shop online, Pulkit Agrawal, co-founder and CEO of social commerce platform Trell, tells Tech in Asia.“There’s a huge need to spread awareness and build trust among non-English-speaking users to make them comfortable with the online paradigms of ecommerce and eventually enabling them to transact,” says Agrawal.Trell, which has raised about US$62 million in funding, allows users to create three- to five-minute videos in their native languages. According to Agrawal, the lifestyle video platform is seeing 30% growth in its user base per month, with an annual GMV target of US$1 billion in the next 12 to 18 months.The CEO says personal care and fashion products see the highest traction on Trell, as buying decisions in these categories are often impulsive. The company is planning to launch live commerce in these categories on its platform this year.Delhi-based Dheeraj Juneja has been live streaming on Roposo since April 2021 / Photo credit: Dheeraj JunejaFor Lalitha Ramani, chief product officer and senior vice president at Myntra, live shopping will “democratize” the personal care and fashion categories, particularly as the company goes deeper into the country’s Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. Myntra, which is owned by Indian ecommerce giant Flipkart, aims to churn out close to 1,000 hours of live video content per month this year.Last November, the company unveiled its live commerce offering, M-Live. Videos on the platform will have a section at the bottom where the goods being showcased by the influencer will be displayed. The customer can then click on a product to get more information about it.According to experts, first-time online shoppers are often overwhelmed by the sheer number of product options in each category on a shopping platform.For example, there are over 6,500 options for women’s black shirts on the Myntra app. Influencers, through live commerce, can help customers curate the best pick. Not only does this nudge a user’s purchase decision forward, it also gives them other insightful tips and information.“[Live commerce] will have a greater impact on teaching customers on how to apply makeup, how a dress fits, how to maintain a dress etc.,” says Ramani.Another popular social networking startup in the country is ShareChat, which is valued at about US$3.7 billion and serves about 180 million active users in 15 different local languages.ShareChat’s short-video platform Moj sealed a partnership with Flipkart in October last year, allowing Moj users to shop directly on the ecommerce platform. The partnership is expected to help Flipkart leverage Moj’s users in smaller cities as well.(From left) Trell co-founders Arun Lodhi, Pulkit Agrawal, and Bimal Kartheek Rebba / Photo credit: TrellAmazon, Flipkart’s arch rival, is not sitting on the sidelines either. It worked with livestreaming influencers during last year’s flagship sales events and has more plans to leverage the content format this year, according to a spokesperson for Amazon India.But it’s not all rosyDespite the upswing in the local live commerce scene, hurdles remain.Previously, pure-play live commerce startups in the country such as Bulbul and Simsim tried cracking the sector.While Simsim was acquired by YouTube in July 2021, Bulbul shut down its live commerce feature in 2020.For live commerce to work, platforms need a wide range of content, amazing influencers, and tons of money to scale, points out Bulbul founder Sachin Bhatia.“To be honest, we were not able to scale up the way we would have liked to,” he told Tech in Asia.In hindsight, Bhatia says Bulbul should have focused on one category first instead of dabbling in several sections like apparels, gadgets, and kitchen items.Another insight the founder learned: Most shoppers engage with live videos but then go back to watch pre-recorded content, recheck product details, and consult family members before making their final purchasing decision.For local players who dabble in live commerce, where it is widely believed that customer decision journeys are accelerated, this could be something to mull over.In addition, not all influencers or content creators can sell effectively. According to industry players, making content for entertainment vs. live commerce is different: In the latter scenario, influencers need to have marketing chops to push products for sale.Roposo, for its part, is running training sessions for nearly 500 live commerce influencers, bringing on experts from China to help groom the potential stars.See also: How big will livestreaming ecommerce get in Southeast Asia?“The top 100 livestreamers will be able to drive 80% of a company’s GMV. So our focus is to identify those livestreamers and work closely with them,” Mansi Jain, general manager and vice president of Roposo, told Tech in Asia.The company is also roping in makeup artists, fitness coaches, and fashion stylists to act as influencers, as these experts can break down the quality of the products they’re using in detail. “We have also onboarded nearly 60 radio jockeys who are excellent in real-time engagement with the consumers,” Jain added.In order to tackle live commerce effectively, platforms must also solve problems unique to the space. The Myntra team, for instance, took months to develop its in-house technology that focuses on color accuracy and other factors like end-to-end streaming latency.Color accuracy is extremely important when selling fashion products, for example. A crimson-colored item cannot appear as burgundy red, as it would fail the buyer’s expectations. End-to-end latency – the time between when an action happens and when the audience sees it – is similarly crucial. If a customer asks a question and the influencer is not able to address it immediately, the “live” aspect of the episode is lost.Still, great content alone won’t be enough. Ecommerce platforms which have a strong logistics chain, might have a competitive edge over pure-play video content players because they can handle the entire customer journey.That said, Roposo is putting the missing pieces together by making important acquisitions. Its parent firm, Glance, acquired full-stack ecommerce platform Shop101 in June 2021.Team Roposo / Photo credit: Roposo“We feel that traditional ecommerce has been very functional and sort of boring,” Piyush Shah, co-founder at Inmobi Group and COO of Glance, told India’s Economic Times then. Live commerce, he said, is “much more fun, more authentic, and more entertaining.”Searching for the winning formulaSimilar to China, India’s strong celebrity culture can amplify live shopping in the country. The upcoming rollout of 5G technology in India this year is also expected to boost the sector. Faster internet connections enable users to have better live content experience and take the leap to become frequent shoppers.For now, it’s too early to say who will win the race between India’s specialized short-video platforms or general ecommerce marketplaces.Besides producing engaging and entertaining experiences, companies are even investing in private labels to make the live experience feel more exclusive.See also: The decade of D2C has just begun in India“We have been very clear since day one that live commerce may take time to grow, but it will have its own market in the country,” says Bhatia of Bulbul, adding that the company is planning to relaunch its live commerce feature as early as this March.",India’s short-video players and general ecommerce marketplaces are vying to capture the country’s up-and-coming live commerce sector.,589814,Samreen Ahmad,True,Thu Huong Le and Jaclyn Tiu,0,"['Analysis', 'Ecommerce', 'Premium Content']","['Amazon India', 'bulbul', 'Ecommerce', 'flipkart', 'glance', 'India', 'inmobi', 'live commerce', 'live shopping', 'live-streaming', 'Meesho', 'Moj', 'myntra', 'redseer', 'RedSeer Consulting', 'Roposo', 'ShareChat', 'short video', 'SimSim', 'TikTok', 'trell', 'video streaming', 'YouTube']",False,,True,True,True,False,8

We break down the big and messy topics of Asia’s tech and startup community. Get the newsletter in your inbox everyday with a Premium subscription.Hello reader,I have been lucky enough to spend most of my life near the sea. Coastal folk across the globe will probably tell you that there is a certain alluring charm about the beach, and they’re not wrong. In the city of Chennai, the friendly yet sprawling fishing community has been a big part of that charm.Living in the capital of Tamil Nadu and one of India’s busiest coastal cities, it is almost impossible not to get entwined with the marine fishers. Slightly over a million of them ply their trade across the state’s 1,000-kilometer coastline.However, due to a lack of feasible alternatives, they deploy outdated – and in some places illegal – fishing methods like bottom trawling. This practice destroys the natural seafloor habitat by essentially rototilling the seabed, causing irreparable damage to the marine ecology.The scenario above is screaming for technological intervention, and aquaculture may just provide the right solution. Today, we take a deep dive into Indonesia-based eFishery’s massive funding round and its ambitions of international expansion, with its eyes firmly set on India and other Southeast Asian markets.Today we look at,The funding round of the lone behemoth of Indonesia’s aquaculture sectorAn Israel-based biotech firm’s US$93 million fundraise Other newsy highlights such as digital yuan’s debut at the Winter Olympics and BharatPe co-founder’s brewing legal battleAlso, if you’re an entrepreneur looking for funding, fill in this form to get your company featured on our list of fundraising startups.Premium summaryMaking a splashImage credit: Timmy LoenIndonesia-based eFishery has just landed the largest-ever VC financing for an aquaculture startup globally. It raised US$90 million in a series C round co-led by Temasek Holdings, SoftBank Vision Fund 2, and Sequoia Capital India.However, with a business model that has achieved positive EBITDA since 2020 and three key revenue drivers, eFishery is primed to make a splash as it eyes entry into other Southeast Asian markets.Two fish, one hook: Profitability did not come at the expense of topline growth for eFishery. The company says it has scaled its network tenfold since its last funding round in 2020, and the number of farmers in its ecosystem has increased by 1,248% over the past year.All alone: Among the main contributing factors to eFishery’s growth is its almost zero competition in Indonesia’s aquaculture space. This is surprising, considering the enormous opportunity that the industry holds – the country taps into only 8% of its aquaculture potential. When asked why he thinks no other startup has shown interest in the field, eFishery co-founder and CEO Gibran Huzaifah quips that it is a “hard sector that requires hard solutions and hard work.”A matter of time: Due to its position as the Indonesian market leader, as well as its impressive top and bottom line, eFishery has attracted questions about a potential IPO. Huzaifah told Tech in Asia that going public is a matter of “when, not if,” but he stressed that the company’s current focus is to continue to grow its business.Read more: Indonesia’s eFishery nets US$90m series C from Temasek, SoftBank, SequoiaStartup spotlightNot immune to fundingMeMed founders Kfir Oved (left) and Eran Eden/ Photo credit: MeMedMeMed has bagged US$93 million from new and existing investors, including Horizons Ventures, Shavit Capital, and Social Capital, in a new financing round.The Israel-based biotech firm developed a COVID-19 Severity Test, which is cleared for use in Europe.

Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration greenlit the MeMed BV test to be used by healthcare providers for distinguishing between bacterial and viral infections in children and adults.Riding the wave: The capital raise comes amid heightened interest in Israel’s deeptech and AI spaces. Israeli companies in the digital health sector raised nearly US$700 million in the first quarter of 2021 – almost matching the amount raised by startups in the field throughout the whole of 2020.Immuno-focused: MeMed has raised over US$200 million to date. The latest investment will be used to scale up manufacturing, accelerate commercialization, and expand its product portfolio centered around the body’s immune response.Calling Southeast Asia’s female foundersWhat’s it like being a female founder in Southeast Asia?

Delivered every Wednesday via email and through the Tech in Asia website, this free newsletter breaks down the biggest stories and trends in fintech. If you’re not a subscriber, get access by registering here.Hello there,Hope you’re doing well as another wave of Covid-19 spreads across the world.While I was doing some research on the buy now, pay later segment in India late last year, I found that people here were even ordering food online and buying market shares using BNPL products.The data was astonishing: In the next four years, BNPL is expected to be a US$50 billion market in India compared to only US$3.5 billion now.That’s why our fintech Big Story this week caught my attention. My colleague Melissa talks about how the impossible-to-ignore BNPL trend, which hit a record high in Australia in early 2021, is now seeing signs of waning in the country. The Land Down Under is one of the most mature BNPL markets in the world, with several listed players such as Afterpay, Zip, Splitit, Openpay, and Fatfish Group.So is this the end of pure BNPL? Much like in India, BNPL is in its infancy stage in Southeast Asia, and it may go the way of Australia. But can BNPL players in the region avoid this downward trend? To find answers to these questions and more, read on.— SamreenTHE BIG STORYBNPL sours in Australia, but will SEA players buck the trend?Image credit: Timmy LoenAustralian BNPL stocks have gone into a tailspin since February 2021 as the model’s defensibility, rising competition, and regulatory risks are called into question.THE HOT TAKESingapore fintech firm iFast finally buys a bankHere’s what happened:The Singapore Exchange-listed fintech firm intends to acquire 85% of BFC Bank, a full licensed UK bank.The acquisition is driven by a belief that banks operate at the “foundation layer” of the financial industry, and having direct access to this will allow iFast to innovate at a faster pace.The S$73 million deal values loss-making BFC at an above-average multiple.Here’s our take:The planned acquisition of an 85% stake in BFC may have come a little late for Christmas, but is certainly a present that iFast has long coveted.Having applied for – and failing to receive – a digital banking license in Hong Kong and Singapore, iFast’s prospects in Malaysia are uncertain. The company is one of at least 29 applicants chasing five licenses there.Why is iFast so keen on having a digital bank?The company, which started life as an online distributor of unit trusts, now owns businesses spanning the B2B, B2C, and B2B2C segments in financial services.Lim Chung Chun, iFast’s founder and CEO, thinks that the fintech sector will become more globalized over time. As such, a digital bank would improve the company’s ability to build a cross-border wealth management business.With the acquisition of BFC, Lim is putting his money where his mouth is.However, the deal values BFC at a price to-book multiple of 1.6x. This is higher than the average for UK banks, which is around 0.7x. Moreover, BFC is not profitable – it lost S$4 million in the first nine months of 2021.The market’s initial response was skeptical, with iFast’s shares falling by 4% after the deal was announced and the trading halt was lifted on January 7.Perhaps investors were unsure of how a UK-licensed bank fits with iFast’s current business, which is solely Asia-focused. Unlike other sectors, banking remains a country-specific industry, with regulators jealously protecting their turf. For example, while BFC is licensed by the UK authorities, the bank cannot simply offer its services to customers in Malaysia.IFast may be hoping that this acquisition will give it experience owning and operating a bank, which will boost the company’s credibility with regulators in other markets it hopes to enter.Still, one wonders why it didn’t follow other regional tech players with digital bank aspirations like Sea Group and Grab, which both have acquired a bank in Indonesia instead. IFast may be more comfortable operating a bank in a developed market like the UK, despite its geographic distance from Singapore.While many are excited by the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi), the scramble to build digital banking businesses shows that tech players still believe in the potential of regulated banks, which act as a trusted centralized provider of financial services.– SimonNEWS YOU SHOULD KNOWCheck out Tech in Asia’s coverage of the fintech scene here.1️⃣ Tiger Global co-leads $25m round of 🇮🇳 B2B fintech startup: Rupifi saw a 50% month-on-month growth in disbursals in the last 12 months while covering more than 50,000 SMEs.2️⃣ BharatPe co-founder in legal tangle after alleged ‘abusive call’: Ashneer Grover allegedly verbally abused a Kotak bank employee over the phone for failing to deliver Nykaa shares to him and his wife during the company’s IPO.3️⃣ Microsoft CEO joins Groww as investor and advisor: The fintech unicorn raised US$251 million at a US$3 billion valuation in October.4️⃣ Pine Labs to raise US$500 million in US listing: The listing could give the Temasek-backed company a valuation of about US$5.5 billion to US$7 billion, according to a Bloomberg report.That’s it for this edition – we hope you liked it!

As the trend grew, it became impossible to ignore.BNPL firms found their spots alongside Visa and Mastercard at checkout counters as consumers lapped up the service’s easy and near-instant approvals. Venture capital firms poured fuel into the trend.Photo credit: piter2121 / 123RFAcross the Indian Ocean, the sentiments toward BNPL have grown more somber.In February 2021, the service hit a fever pitch in Australia, one of the most mature BNPL markets worldwide. The country has more publicly listed BNPL firms than anywhere else in the world.Ecommerce was thriving as the Covid-19 pandemic accelerated a shift toward online shopping, providing a “one-off big lift” to BNPL firms, Pranav Gundlapalle, an analyst at Sanford C Bernstein covering Pan-Asian banks and fintech firms, tells Tech in Asia.Generous stimulus packages dished out to households in the US, the largest market of Australia’s leading BNPL firm Afterpay, helped fan the flames.The exuberance has been short-lived. Less than a year on, confidence in Australian BNPL firms is waning – if share prices are any indication – and prices may have yet hit bottom.Share prices of Fatfish Group, IOUPay, Sezzle, Openpay, Zip, and Splitit have fallen since their highs in February 2021. / Image credit: Timmy LoenThe decline has been swift. Since their February highs, shares in Afterpay and its rivals – including Zip, Splitit, Openpay, and Fatfish Group – have lost between 50% and 90% of their value on the public market.This is partly driven by concerns about the model’s defensibility amid high competition and fears that last year’s ecommerce boom may not be sustained.And with BNPL firms facing more scrutiny from regulators worldwide, Gundlapalle expects downward pressures to persist, especially for standalone players that offer a single product.“I would say you don’t have a lot of positive catalysts for this space in the medium term,” he warns.See also: Southeast Asia’s biggest buy now, pay later players (update)In Southeast Asia, BNPL is still in its infancy, with the trend gaining significant momentum only in the past year. The trend playing out in Australia threatens to stall growth for young players in the region, many of whom are starting to feel the impact of heightened competition despite an increase in customer adoption.A crowded marketAs the BNPL movement gained steam worldwide, firms flooded the market with almost identical offerings.A turning point came when large tech incumbents joined the fray in the third quarter of 2021. Apple and PayPal signaled their entry into the market, while Block (previously Square) acquired Afterpay, making it clear that “BNPL would become more of a feature and less of a product in itself,” Gundlapalle notes.Photo credit: nikom1234 / 123RFThis put standalone BNPL firms in an “odd” position where they just have one feature compared to larger competitors, he adds.Much of the BNPL model rests on charging merchants a premium over alternative payment methods for its superior conversion rates, larger basket sizes, and higher overall customer lifetime values. These fees drive the bulk of earnings for BNPL firms, since most players in developed markets do not charge customers any late fees.Without a moat, a firm like Afterpay could see its profit margins erode in the long run, as merchants seek out cheaper alternatives – a dime or a dozen in the current climate.Afterpay’s net transaction margins (NTM) – the operating profit margin on each transaction – are already decreasing. In the 12 months ending June 30, 2021, the firm’s NTM was 2%, down from 2.4% in the second half of 2020.Bernstein analysts predict that Afterpay’s margins will decline to be in line with its peers. / Image credit: BernsteinThat said, potential synergies following Block’s acquisition of Afterpay, including the latter’s integration with the former’s mobile payments app Cash, could cushion the decline in NTM and open up new revenue streams.While not all “pure-play” firms will see an acquisition, players with a strong local presence can remain attractive buyout targets for larger BNPL companies looking to expand fast.It’s also worth noting that the BNPL firms’ margins are declining despite the strong growth these companies are seeing across the board.Zip, which operates in the US as QuadPay, saw costs balloon in its 2021 financial year, even as it more than tripled its active customer base to 7.3 million. Afterpay also signed up six million new customers in the same period, bringing its total active customer base to 16 million.“Lower gross profit margins as well as higher-than-expected credit loss provisions and net bad debts” contributed to the poor result, Citi analysts wrote in a note following Zip’s earnings release.Increased regulatory scrutiny has also dampened BNPL stocks, particularly in developed markets.Last October, the Reserve Bank of Australia told BNPL firms that they can no longer stop merchants from passing on the cost of BNPL services to their customers. The move levels the playing field between more costly BNPL services and credit cards, removing a key advantage for players in the country.Two months later, the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau launched a probe on BNPL firms over concerns that consumers might be rapidly accumulating debt through BNPL plans. The probe also investigated the companies’ use of consumer data, as well as how sufficient their disclosures are, among others. The move sent BNPL stocks tumbling.The end of pure BNPL​​To survive, BNPL firms will have to introduce new features.“I don’t think any of the current valuations would make sense if you assume [BNPL firms] will be doing BNPL only for the rest of their journey. Almost all BNPL players’ valuation today has some element of the assumption that they’ll start doing a much wider set of products,” Gundlapalle notes.BNPL pioneer Klarna, for instance, has introduced bank accounts in Germany. The company also offers budgeting tools, and it runs a loyalty program on top of being a shopping app.In November, Afterpay began taking deposits into savings accounts that are linked to a physical debit card or e-wallet. The firm also provides advertising and analytics services, and it has hinted that it may soon distribute mortgage loans.This year, Zip is planning to roll out crypto trading in the US and allow merchants to accept payments in Bitcoin.Photo credit: AtomeLast November, Atome CEO David Chen told Tech in Asia that the company was developing new products and features to drive store traffic to its merchants. These include “merchant analytics and smarter merchant dashboards” that can help drive conversions.Indonesia-based fintech firm Akulaku, which saw a strong growth in revenue last year due to the pick-up in BNPL, also introduced additional services through its digital banking app Neo+ last year.While many BNPL firms have launched ecommerce and lead generation features, these alone may not be enough to stave off competition from online marketplaces that are building native BNPL offerings.“At that point, I don’t see why somebody would log into [an] Afterpay or Akulaku to check out what to buy, they’d just go where they usually shop,” Gundlapalle says.“The real attraction is in financial services,” he adds.Firms in Southeast Asia will evolve differentlyAs BNPL firms in mature markets grapple with increasing regulation and rising competition, Southeast Asia-based players will face a different set of challenges.On the one hand, regional BNPL firms have little to worry about a regulatory shake-up, given many of them already operate as consumer lending businesses and hold the requisite payment and banking licenses.However, the lack of a credit-tested customer base and the concentration of ecommerce in a few major marketplaces in the region could limit the pace of expansion for these BNPL firms.The US, a significant driver of BNPL sales in the past year, “is a large market not just from a population perspective, but also the size of the ecommerce market outside platforms like Amazon and Walmart,” Gundlapalle notes.Comparatively, large marketplaces like Shopee, Lazada, and Tokopedia, dominate ecommerce sales in Southeast Asia.Photo credit: ShopeeThis matters because BNPL platforms that work directly with independent retailers enjoy better take rates than those that go through a marketplace, which might charge a commission.See also: The dark side of ‘buy now, pay later’That said, without a credit-tested consumer base in low-income markets, rapid expansion might prove costly for BNPL firms if default rates skyrocket.There’s also the risk of BNPL firms over-relying on ecommerce platforms. Like Shopee, other marketplaces may eventually launch installment payments of their own.On the bright side, regional players are gaining interest income as consumers in the region are willing to pay interest on installment payments, given the under-penetration of credit.Shopee, for instance, charges its Filipino users 1% to 5% and Malaysian users 1.25% in interest per month for its Paylater service. In contrast, vanilla BNPL offerings by Affirm and Afterpay are interest-free.Another emerging market advantage is cost savings from lower repayment costs – the fees incurred by BNPL firms upon collection of subsequent installment payments from customers – as e-wallets or interbank networks like India’s united payments interface are dominant modes of payment.In developed markets, these fees are the biggest cost for BNPL firms and can add up to “almost 1%” of a transaction, as customers tend to link BNPL accounts with credit or debit cards, Gundlapalle says.See also: Visual: The hefty cost of credit card paymentsThe analyst expects that growth will continue for multiple BNPL players in the region given lower regulatory risk and under penetration.

We break down the big and messy topics of Asia’s tech and startup community. Get the newsletter in your inbox everyday with a Premium subscription.Hello reader,What are your thoughts on employee stock option plans (ESOPs)? I’ve long concluded that it’s not something I’d be keen on. Having liquidity is important to me, and I’m not sure that I’d be able to stay at a company long enough to see my stock options vest and be able to cash out, given the uncertainty of the world we live in.There are many other folks in Southeast Asia who have similar sentiments, which is why ESOPs aren’t really a thing in the region, despite the growth in its tech and startup scene. Still, ESOPs, when done properly, can help a company attract and retain talent and provide opportunities for employees to reap the rewards of their faith in the firm. That’s what Circles Life is aiming to do with its own ESOP scheme.Today we look at,Circles Life’s ESOP plan and what makes it different Vietnamese payment firm MoMo’s latest acquisition Other newsy highlights such as Carsome’s latest fundraise and Carousell’s potential route to the public market Premium summaryTaking a closer look at Circles Life’s ESOPImage credit: Timmy LoenESOPs aren’t very popular in Southeast Asia. While some founders see them as a way to attract talent, many employees remain skeptical. In Singapore, telco firm Circles Life is shaking up this perception with its ESOP program, which it says is “the most generous in the region.”G is for generosity: Circles Life runs its stock buyback program roughly every 18 months, allowing employees to sell vested stocks back to the company at regular intervals. The firm also issues two months’ worth of stock options as part of their basic compensation to employees, regardless of rank or tenure, every 12 months and has a short vesting period of just a year, as compared to three to four years at other companies. It’s strike price is also near negligible, at around US$1 a share.Make me a believer: Circles Life says its ESOP is a key aspect of how it attracts talent and turns “employees into believers.” According to co-founder Rameez Ansar, the firm finances its buyback program with cash on its balance sheet, allowing it to create liquidity for employees “from a position of strength.”On the flip side: However, it’s hard to tell if Circles Life’s approach to ESOPs is all that effective. Some feel that the firm’s short vesting period may keep it from achieving its goal of retaining talent, while others say that its founders need to be sure that they’re using their cash for the best purposes.Read more: ​​Circles Life’s ESOP breaks new ground. But is there a trade-off?Startup spotlightOf payments and sales managementNguyen Manh Tuong, vice chairman and co-CEO of MoMo at its series D fundraising announcement in January./ Photo credit: MoMoPayments is a big part of the digital economy, so it’s no surprise that Vietnam-based payments major MoMo bought shares in Nhanh, a provider of sales management software products.Established in 2014, Nhanh specializes in cloud-based solutions for omnichannel sales management.

727811,2022-01-11T06:00:59,2022-01-11T06:37:53,"Indonesia’s KoinWorks raises $108m from MDI, East Ventures",koinworks-series-c-funding,post,"For KoinWorks, an Indonesian digital lending company, the Covid-19 period has been a pivotal moment that has enabled it to surge forward in the right direction.“At the beginning of the pandemic, we tried to step back and look into the situation. But we realized that it’s actually a mistake because our market kept growing amid the outbreak,” the company’s co-founder Willy Arifin told Tech in Asia.KoinWorks’ main borrower are small and medium enterprises (SMEs) who have digital footprints, such as those who own online shops on Tokopedia and Shopee. These business ownershave been somewhat shielded from the blow from Covid-induced social restrictions.KoinWorks co-founders (from left) Willy Arifin and Benedicto Haryono / Photo credit: KoinWorksIn the past 18 months, the number of SMEs that have digital footprints has doubled from around 10 million to 20 million businesses, according to Arifin, who said such a surge usually takes five years in a non-Covid scenario. At the same time, KoinWorks kept its non-performing loan (NPL) ratio under 2%, which is significantly lower than traditional financial institutions.Amid the pandemic, the company reached US$15 million in loan disbursements per month, and logged positive cash flow, Arifin said. The firm also hit 1.5 million users at the end of last year.The company raised a US$108 million in a series C funding round led by MDI Ventures, which is Telkom Group’s venture arm. Existing investors such as Quona Capital, Triodos Investment Management, Saison Capital, AC Ventures, and East Ventures also took part in the round.The investment comprised US$43 million in equity and US$65 million in debt capital. Since its establishment, the company has raised US$70 million in equity and around US$110 million in debt.KoinWorks plans to use the fresh funding to double its existing workforce of 400 employees, who hail from Indonesia, Singapore, Vietnam, and India. The company also aims to triple its revenue and double the number of its users before the end of 2022.Evolution into a full-fledged financial service for SMEsSince being founded in 2016, KoinWorks has expanded from being a platform dedicated to peer-to-peer lending to launching several new features to expand its user base.Arifin said the firm realized that it should do more to help budding founders from the start of their entrepreneurship journey after having to reject many entrepreneurs looking for loans from its lending platform.That’s why KoinWorks launched a neobank feature that allows users to open business bank accounts directly from its app. It also gave them learning material on how to manage an online business, promote it, and communicate with customers.When the company is comfortable with a business owner’s transaction history, it gives them the KoinWorks Neo Card, a Mastercard virtual card that can be used to do any kind of online payments. Further, the SME can also borrow money through KoinWorks’ lending platform.The Jakarta-based fintech firm has also introduced an earned-wage access (EWA) service called KoinGaji and a gold investment feature called KoinGold.See also: Is earned wage access Indonesia’s latest hot ticket?KoinWorks’ took an unusual route for fintech firms by starting with a lending business – the holy grail of the financial sector due to its high take rate – and then expanding into other services. Arifin said it was a natural evolution as most borrowers get their first productive loan from KoinWorks.No plan to go abroadArifin said KoinWorks has shown positive cash flow, especially in its lending business. However, the company has reinvested the surplus to build other features and keep growing its market share.The co-founder also isn’t shy about his interest in going public. Without going into specifics, he said an IPO – whether in the US via a SPAC merger, or a direct listing on the Indonesian stock exchange – was still on the cards. He said the listing wouldn’t be “too far away.”However, Arifin underlined that he still wants to focus on the firm’s home market and has no plans to expand Koinworks’ lending business to other countries despite having developers from outside Indonesia.“Half of the GDP (gross domestic product) of Southeast Asian come from Indonesia, we know where the money is,” Arifin stressed.",Koinworks has raised US$70 million in equity and US$110 million in debt to date.,86192,Aditya Hadi Pratama,True,Miguel Cordon and Arpit Nayak,0,"['Fintech', 'Investments', 'News', 'Startups']","['ac ventures', 'Benedicto Haryono', 'East Ventures', 'Indonesia', 'Koinworks', 'MDI Ventures', 'neobank', 'P2P Lending', 'Quona Capital', 'Saison Capital', 'Triodos Investment Management', 'Willy Arifin']",False,,True,False,True,False,3

727912,2022-01-11T02:00:09,2022-01-11T02:58:14,"Exclusive: Indonesia’s eFishery nets $90m series C from Temasek, SoftBank, Sequoia",exclusive-idn-aquaculture-startup-hauls-90m-series-temasek-softbank-sequoia,post,"Indonesian startup eFishery has raised a series C funding round of US$90 million, which marks the largest-ever VC financing for an aquaculture startup globally.The round, which is also the biggest for a Southeast Asian agritech startup, was co-led by Temasek Holdings, SoftBank Vision Fund 2, and Sequoia Capital India. Existing investors including Go-Ventures, The Northstar Group, Wavemaker Partners, and Aqua-Spark also participated in the round.In an exclusive interview with Tech in Asia, eFishery co-founder and CEO Gibran Huzaifah said that the proceeds will be used to strengthen the company’s existing ecosystem as it aims to become a “digital cooperative” for fish farmers.Gibran Huzaifah, CEO and Co-founder of eFishery / Photo credit: eFishery“We want to have 1 million fish farmers as members of the cooperative by 2025,” he shares. The company currently has 30,000 fish farmers on its platform.The fresh capital will go towards eFishery’s international expansion plans, having piloted the project for a couple of years. The company expects to have a commercial presence in as many as 10 different countries by 2025.Founded in 2013 in the city of Bandung, the startup entered the market with an IoT device called eFishery Feeder, which enables automated feeding in fish and shrimp farms. Farmers can then monitor and schedule feeding via a smartphone app. The device also collects data on farm production patterns and fish behavior.Having access to this valuable data has helped eFishery create a host of other solutions. It now makes money from three main revenue sources: the feeder device, which farmers can rent for 5,000 rupiah (about US$0.35) a day; eFishery Mall, a marketplace for selling fish and shrimp feed; and eFishery Fresh, which allows the company to sell fresh fish and shrimp to B2B customers such as restaurants, export buyers, and wholesale traders.The company’s business model serves a vast market: Indonesia’s aquaculture production volume reached 15.1 million metric tons in 2019. EFishery says it has achieved positive EBITDA since 2020.Unchallenged growthInterestingly, profitability did not come at the expense of topline growth for eFishery. The company says it has scaled its network tenfold since its last funding round in 2020, and the number of farmers in its ecosystem has increased 1,248% over the last year.Among the main contributing factors is its almost zero competition in Indonesia’s aquaculture space. This is surprising, considering the enormous opportunity that the industry holds. The country taps into only 8% of its aquaculture potential.While other startups in the maritime and fisheries industry exist – like East Ventures-backed Aruna, for example – none of them provide aquaculture-focused solutions.When asked why he thinks no other startup has shown interest in the field, the CEO quips that it is a “hard sector that requires hard solutions and hard work.”Usman, a catfish farmer in Cirebon, Indonesia / Photo credit: eFisheryHe adds that any new player would quickly realize that cracking the aquaculture game demands considerable effort and time, as fish farming is a segment that is almost impossible to growth-hack.“I remember the time when we offered our equipment for free to farmers but they turned it down. We even paid them to use it, but they still turned it down. So the only way is to come and use a personal approach,” Huzaifah says.However, it is inevitable that competition will come sooner or later, according to Ivan Arie Sustiawan, managing partner at VC firm Tunnelerate.Sustiawan, whose firm also evaluates early-stage agritech startups for potential investment, observes that “new tech-based aquaculture players are coming to this space to fill the gap or challenge existing prominent players.”For the moment, though, eFishery’s main rival will likely come in the form of local and/or traditional middlemen. Such players are bound to resist anyone that disrupts their captive market, says Sustiawan, who is also a co-founder and former CEO of agritech company Tanihub.This is a hurdle that eFishery’s Huzaifah acknowledges, describing it as a “potential barrier” in his company’s efforts to onboard significantly more farmers. But Sustiawan points out that there can be smart ways of navigating through such barriers.“This can be managed by embracing and collaborating with [middlemen] for certain cultivation and development projects,” he says.Big fish in more pondsDue to its position as the Indonesian market leader, as well as its impressive top and bottom line, eFishery has understandably attracted questions about a potential IPO.Huzaifah told Tech in Asia that going public is a matter of “when, not if,” but he stressed that eFishery’s current focus is to continue to grow its business.One area of growth is its planned geographical expansion, which is likely to boost the company’s market value once the public listing comes around.Indonesia’s eFishery helps shrimp and fish farmers grow their businesses sustainably. / Photo credit: eFisheryGoing from zero to its target of 10 countries within just three years is ambitious, to say the least. That said, Huzaifah believes that eFishery has onboarded the perfect partners in its new round to make this a reality.Prolific global investors like Temasek, SoftBank, and Sequoia can use their connections to help the startup roll out its operations in different markets. For instance, Thailand has been a long-term expansion target for eFishery. It expects to finally set up an operation in the country within months through a joint venture with a local firm.Next in line are Vietnam, China, and India, where eFishery has had early discussions with potential local partners.“Building a localized solution will be a key ingredient for success in all markets, especially adapting the technology to varying aquaculture and climate conditions as well as tailoring the go-to-market approach in each region,” says Johan Surani, vice president at Sequoia India.Huzaifah claims that eFishery has become the biggest aquaculture tech startup in the world, and he is confident that his company can replicate its success in other markets.“We already have an end-to-end model and our products/services have passed the development phase,” he contends. “With the right operating model and partner, we believe we can scale more quickly in a new country and get positive unit economics from day one.”","The round is the largest-ever VC financing for an aquaculture startup globally, and it will fuel eFishery’s expansion to 10 countries by 2025.",586001,Ardi Wirdana,True,Putra Muskita and Eileen C.

We break down the big and messy topics of Asia’s tech and startup community. Get the newsletter in your inbox everyday with a Premium subscription.Hello reader,The importance of financial inclusion to a country is often overlooked. It helps build the key concepts of credit and savings and is a major step toward inclusive growth, i.e., growing financially stable together as a population, irrespective of age, gender, race or income.Financial inclusion is a major issue that needs to be addressed, especially among countries in Southeast Asia. For example, a staggering 47% of the Philippines’ adult population are unbanked as of the second quarter of 2021. Yet, the topic, like most things related to banking or finance (ahem, taxes), is often met with an eye roll.The advances in fintech and digital transactions are, nonetheless, painting a brighter picture for financial inclusion in Southeast Asia. More and more startups are making financial services easily accessible. Today, we analyze how the Philippines’ digibanks are accelerating financial inclusion in the country.Today we look at,How the Philippines is banking on a digital remedyThe latest funding round of one of India’s top hyperlocal delivery playersOther newsy highlights such as lucrative fintech funding rounds and an exclusive club with an odd requirementPremium summaryA digibank revolution awaitsImage credit: Timmy LoenWith a plethora of documents required, long queues, and a barrage of financial jargon to face, there are very few things I hate more than visiting my bank. Regardless of its importance, bank visits are cumbersome. Luckily, I haven’t visited one in a long time.While that is partly due to the pandemic, it is mainly down to me changing the way I transact. I count on digital banking and fintech apps for payments, investments, and other daily transactions. As digital transactions slowly spread its roots across the Philippines – thanks to a new group of digibanks – I cannot wait to see its citizens join me on the bandwagon.It’s a team sport: Digital bank executives point to the current state of internet connectivity in the Philippines, which has an internet penetration rate of 67%, as a roadblock to the industry’s development. “Telcos also have to up their game and build the infrastructure to make it possible for digital to play in those far-off places,” says Albert Tinio, chief commercial officer and co-founder of digital bank GoTyme.The chosen ones: In October 2021, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), the country’s central bank, issued digital bank licenses to only six players – GoTyme, Maya Bank, Tonik, Overseas Filipino Bank, Union Digital Bank, and UNObank. Nine other applicants for the license were not approved, as “they had not completed the requirements in time,” according to a BSP statement.The more the merrier: Players in the space feel there is a need for more digital bank operators in the Philippines. It is a “misnomer to say it is crowded,” Jojo Malolos, president and CEO of GoTyme, tells Tech in Asia. Similarly, Tonik Bank CEO Greg Krasnov believes that having more digibank players will help to accelerate financial inclusion in the country.Read more: Banking on a digital remedy in the PhilippinesStartup spotlightConsider it DunJumping from one digital trend to another, we now focus on the poster child of India’s hyperlocal delivery scene – Dunzo. It has bagged a whopping US$240 million in its financing round led by Reliance Retail Ventures, with participation from existing investors Lightbox, Lightrock, 3L Capital, and Alteria Capital.A sizable chunk: With an investment of US$200 million, Reliance Retail owns a 25.8% stake in Dunzo on a fully diluted basis.Broadening horizons: The fresh capital will be used to help Dunzo enable instant delivery of essentials from a network of microwarehouses. The company also seeks to expand its B2B business vertical to enable logistics for local merchants in Indian cities.Hand in hand: Dunzo and Reliance Retail will enter into certain business partnerships, where the former will enable hyperlocal logistics for the retail stores operated by the latter. Dunzo will also facilitate last-mile deliveries for the merchant network of JioMart, a unit under Reliance Retail.In partnership withStrong leadership makes all the differenceDuring my time in school, in the military, and in my career, I’ve worked with and under many different superiors. I’ve seen the damage that bad leaders can do, as well as the incredible positive impact that good ones can have. The best leaders can guide others through both big and small actions – not only do they inspire others with rhetoric, but they also lead by example and instruction.The current business landscape is as uncertain as ever, which makes strong leadership even more vital. Courses like the ESSEC &amp; Mannheim Executive MBA Asia-Pacific program can help leaders strengthen the skills they need to work through difficult situations. Designed specifically to address the demands of senior management in Asia, the program offers an innovative and contemporary curriculum that covers the latest business trends, focusing on practical and actionable insights.Find out more about how the program can take your leadership skills to the next level on this website.Quick bytes1️⃣ Funding (digi)bankedSygnum, a Zurich-based digital bank with a Singapore asset management license, has raised S$120 million (US$88.2 million) in its series B financing round led by Sun Hung Kai &amp; Co.

These are some of the interesting ways I’ve seen NFTs used in community building and how they might evolve over time.Exclusivity: airdrops or early access for new releasesOne of the clearest benefits of holding an NFT is having early or exclusive access to future releases from your favorite brands and creators. This could be in the form of a free NFT from a future release by a brand whose NFT you already hold.Alternatively, some creators give those who already hold their NFTs early access to succeeding launches. This type of exclusivity becomes valuable if the demand for the drop is greater than the supply.A subsequent collection produced by a creator is often a large milestone in the community, generating a lot of engagement and excitement in the lead-up to the drop. For brands with a large following, there is generally monetary value for the second set of NFTs they release, which benefits their NFT holders.A good example of this would be the Robotos project, which had a highly anticipated launch in October last year. Robotos is a collection of droid characters designed by artist Pablo Stanleythat are minted as NFTs.Every single one of the 10,000 robotos are unique and algorithmically generated using more than 170 different hand-drawn traits. Their design – coupled with Stanley’s enthusiastic personality – established a vibrant community around the NFTs. It’s an active group that holds conversations about the direction of the project on platforms like Discord or Twitter Spaces.Every roboto holder will get a free “robopet companion,” which has been a much-awaited milestone in the project, and the community has been trying to guess what the robopets look like for weeks. When a sneak peak was finally announced, the artist did not disappoint: Every robopet will inherit one trait from the roboto they are based on, which holders already love.Robopets from the Robotos project by Pablo StanleyPhysical merchandise is also often exclusively distributed to NFT holders. This is particularly effective for brands that have already created a certain level of exclusivity and loyalty. For a digital-native generation, owning virtual assets and being part of tribes is important, just like owning a recognizable watch or driving a nice car is important for some people.One recent example would be the Mutant Ape Yacht Club’s merchandise store that is only available to its NFT holders.Merchandise that can only be purchased if you hold a Mutant Ape Yacht Club NFTVoting and governance: shaping the direction of the brandDifferent communities are innovating with the participation of its members, and brands are experimenting to see what it would be like to include token holders in decentralized decision-making.A great example would be the Nouns DAO project. Some of the initiatives that Nouns holders have voted on include creating a Nouns comic, building an iOS and Apple Watch app, and donating ether to charities. All the funds for these initiatives come from the Nouns treasury, which was built through mints (that’s NFT speak for direct sales) of Nouns NFTs and ongoing royalties from secondary sales.List of proposals Noun holders can review and vote onWhile Nouns is a radical example, there are many other projects that take feedback from their holders. One would be the Sneaky Vampire Syndicate, which announced a collaboration with a high-end sneaker retailer as its first physical brand collaboration.The news was met with very mixed reactions from the community. Many understood that this was the first in a pipeline of planned partnerships, but a number of holders voiced out that they did not buy into the project thinking it would become a sneaker brand.In this case, democracy played out in real time: The team reacted quickly and postponed the partnership, focusing on digital utility in the short run.Internal economy: utility tokensUtility tokens are used by projects that focus on being usable in the digital world. Often, these tokens are distributed to NFT holders at regular intervals as a reward for holding on to the NFTs. These tokens can also be used for various purchases within the project’s ecosystem.“Burn mechanisms,” which remove a certain number of tokens from circulation on a regular basis, ensure the value of the token does not depreciate over time. However, managing supply and demand is a balancing game and requires a team that’s familiar with “tokenomics” to pull off.A recent project in the space that uses tokenomics – the study of the economics of cryptocurrencies – is Dojicrew by famed street artist James Ame.Dojicrew by James AmeAme and his team are creating a unique system where each figure is a combination of individual NFTs classified as “traits” that are interchangeable – just like a physical lego figure. Each NFT is assigned a rank at random and issued a daily amount of “zingots” depending on its rank. These zingots are utility tokens that can be used to purchase traits from other players or new traits that are released by the artist.The system creates an internal economy that operates with all the benefits of being digital while mimicking the physical collector space, where participants have full ownership of their unique collection.Possible evolution of communitiesThe space is still in its very early days, so it will be interesting to see how community building continues to evolve as NFTs become more pervasive and Web3 sees mainstream adoption. I believe NFT communities will evolve into tribes in the metaverse and will be increasingly used as a proxy for social standing.Identities and tribes in the metaverseIt is only human nature for communities to form in the Web3 universe. You can change between avatars and belong to multiple communities, but everyone will have one avatar that belongs with a community they feel most at home with.I believe profile picture NFTs are the first generation of avatars in the metaverse. Different communities are already forming across various NFT projects, mostly existing in siloed Discord servers. These NFTs will evolve into 3D avatars for the metaverse, and the relationships formed in strong communities will outlast the mediums we used to get there.Social standing as collateralIn the real world, we often assign credibility to someone based on their social standing, more often subconsciously than intentionally. However, intentional efforts to do this do exist, especially in environments where other preferred data points are difficult to verify. One example would be in the microfinance space, where borrowers can secure loans if their peers vouch for their trustworthiness.In the anonymous online world, it can be hard to find trusted data points. However, individuals can show the NFTs they hold, representing the communities they are in.If you are an NFT holder in a well-regarded community, you will want to avoid being reproached or removed from that community by misbehaving. That’s why offering your social standing as collateral is a way to gain some – though not absolute – trust. However, this will first require the mass market to understand the value of Web3 communities.I’m looking forward to seeing new community engagement strategies evolve over time. We live in an increasingly interconnected world, yet we have found authentic community building to be difficult to scale. I believe NFTs are the innovation that can change that.This article was first published on Hackernoon.","In an increasingly interconnected world, authentic community building is difficult to scale. NFTs could change that.",12815,Chris Sirise,False,Jaclyn Tiu,0,"['Blockchain', 'Community']","['blockchain', 'community', 'nft', 'non-fungible tokens', 'opinion']",False,,True,False,True,False,6

Delivered once a month via email and through the Tech in Asia website, this free newsletter breaks down the biggest stories and trends in greentech. If you’re not a subscriber, get access by registering here.Hi there,2021 was a watershed year for climate tech investing – more investors were actively involved in the sector, making more deals and pouring in greater amounts of money. It seemed any company that claimed to be tackling the climate crisis instantly became a darling in investors’ eyes.However, buzzwords like “ESG” are being thrown around a lot because there isn’t a clear definition of the term.Did you pay attention to any climate-focused funds last year? What do you think the climate investment landscape will be like this year? I would love to hear your thoughts!— NicoleTHE BIG STORYMeet the players fighting plastic scourge in SEAImage credit: ShutterstockPlastic waste startups are on the rise, but more needs to be done to scale their impact.DEEP READS1️⃣ How 2021 became the year of ESG investingEnvironmental, social, and governance (ESG) became the new buzzword in investing in 2021. Over the past year, ESG has grown to make up 10% of worldwide fund assets. According to the latest data, money poured into ESG-focused funds hit a record high with US$649 billion (as of November 30), up from US$542 billion in the previous year.Ostensibly, more money pouring into ESG is a good sign that businesses and financial institutions are embracing sustainable finance. The reality, however, paints a less rosy picture.For one, the corporate ESG data that are currently available are often incomplete and inconsistent across companies, sectors, and countries. Moreover, asset management firms that compile some of the most popular funds don’t always agree on what ESG means, resulting in companies that very loosely fit the bill being included in the mix.A new report found that many of these funds have a carbon footprint not much lower than the S&amp;P 500. At present, the climate performance of a company is often considered of less importance by portfolio managers than, say, its market cap.This year, ESG investing will likely continue to balloon, but it will also face more scrutiny. Regulators worldwide are putting more pressure on companies to prioritize ESG disclosures. The US Securities and Exchange Commission, for example, has been working on providing more guidance on ESG and carbon emission disclosures. The European Commission has also been firming up its rules on the classifications of climate-friendly activities.Beijing / Photo credit: Unsplash2️⃣ Top equity funds in Asia are all buying China’s green stocksAsia’s top funds are investing in Chinese green stocks, and, crucially, making great returns. According to Bloomberg, the region’s five best-performing US$1 billion-plus equity funds recorded over 40% returns this year by investing in green sectors. The China AMC Energy Innovation Equity Fund saw total returns of 55%, the highest among the five funds.Government policy has been fuelling the growth in China’s green sectors, including renewable energy products and EVs. Last year, Beijing pledged to become carbon neutral by 2060. In its Five Year Plan, released in March, China set an 18% reduction target for carbon dioxide intensity and a 13.5% reduction target for energy intensity from 2021 to 2025.The support from policy-makers boosted the stocks of companies like those of battery maker Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. (CATL), whose shares soared more than 80% to record highs this year.In the long term, opportunities abound for China’s green sector. However, in the short term, it is subjected to a lot of volatility coming from events like the US’s sanction of Chinese solar panels over the treatment of Uyghur Muslims. China’s EV and battery makers are also facing increasingly scarce supply of raw materials such as cobalt, graphite, and nickel.TRENDING NEWSYou can also check out Tech in Asia’s coverage of Asia’s greentech scene here.1️⃣ Former Lyft CSO and Freestyle Capital co-founder team up to back climate tech startupsLyft’s former chief strategy officer and head of business, Raj Kapoor, and Freestyle Capital co-founder Josh Felser launched an early-stage venture capital firm Climactic. The new company wants to invest exclusively in startups working toward net-zero goals. It has so far backed 11 companies, investing US$50,000 to US$100,000 per deal. The company did not disclose any future fundraising plans.Why it matters:Climactic is breaking into the increasingly crowded climate tech investing space. Lowercarbon Capital by billionaire investor Chris Sacca recently raised US$800 million fund in August, and UK-based 2150 VC raised a US$312 million fund in October. Closer to home, Singapore’s Wavemaker Partners launched a climate tech venture builder in the same month.Jeff Bezos at Amazon Spheres Grand Opening in Seattle / Photo credit: Wikimedia Commons2️⃣ Bezos Earth Fund announces $443m in grants to advance environmental justice, conserve and restore nature, and improve monitoring and accountabilityAmazon founder Jeff Bezos’ Earth Fund awarded US$443 million in grants dedicated to climate justice, nature conservation and restoration, and other climate efforts. The grants were part of the Earth Fund’s commitment to give away US$10 billion this decade to climate change-related initiatives.Why it matters:The launch of Bezos’ philanthropy scale-up comes amid recent controversy over Amazon’s worker rights violation and its outsized role in the global waste problem. Last year, the ecommerce firm’s carbon footprint grew by nearly 20%.Windfarm at Mölsheim, Germany / Photo credit: Unsplash3️⃣ Germany approves 900m euros for green hydrogen projectGermany’s economy ministry announced it would invest US$1 billion into a funding scheme to support green hydrogen.The new scheme, dubbed H2Global, proposes the use of a “double auction” model. It involves buying hydrogen or hydrogen derivatives in non-EU countries at the lowest possible price with 10-year contracts. These contracts are processed through an intermediary established by the private sector. The products are then sold using short-term auctions at the highest possible price to companies within the EU.Since green hydrogen is still relatively expensive, the intermediary service will likely see losses in the first couple of years. However, the federal grant will offset these losses for a maximum of 10 years. The losses are expected to decrease as the demand for hydrogen rises. The first deliveries of these green hydrogen products to Germany and Europe are slated for 2024.Why it matters:Most hydrogen used today comes from natural gas (a fossil fuel), and the process emits large amounts of carbon dioxide. Green hydrogen, on the other hand, is produced from water by electrolysis and emits almost no greenhouse gasses, but it is energy-intensive.If green hydrogen is going to play a key role in decarbonizing Germany’s economy, then it means there needs to be a massive acceleration of renewable energy production.STARTUP WATCH1️⃣ Gates-backed fund invests in carbon-capture startup SustaeraCarbon-capture startup Sustaera Inc. has raised US$10 million in a series A funding round led by Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures. The North Carolina-based startup uses a readily available alkali-based material to absorb carbon dioxide out of air. The process does not require heat generated from fossil fuels and can run entirely on renewable electricity. The company’s first client is payments system provider Stripe.2️⃣ Nuclear fusion startup lands $1.8b as investors chase star powerMassachusetts-based nuclear fusion startup Commonwealth Fusion Systems has secured more than US$1.8 billion in what is said to be the largest private investment of its kind. The company’s backers include Bill Gates and philanthropist George Soros.The global push to reduce carbon emissions has given rise to carbon-free energy like nuclear fusion power, which is generated by merging very light nuclei like hydrogen. The company’s competitor, Helion Energy, also secured large amounts of funding this year.3️⃣ Singapore’s Keppel to acquire Shell-backed Cleantech SolarSingapore-based Keppel Corporation is acquiring solar power company Cleantech Solar Energy, which focuses on rooftop photovoltaic projects. Keppel is investing US$150 million to acquire a 51% stake in the solar energy company. The remaining 49% of the equity interest is currently held by Shell Eastern Petroleum.Solar panels / Photo credit: Unsplash4️⃣ Carbon-capture firm nabs $30m in venture capital fundsCarbon America, a Colorado-based carbon-capture and storage firm, has raised US$30 million in a series A funding round from investors, including Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, ArcTern Ventures, and Energy Impact Partners.Founded in 2019, Carbon America aims to become a one-stop shop that provides a wide range of services, including engineering and technology, financing, incentive navigation, and more.5️⃣ EV ride-hail leasing company Hive raises $30m in funding roundEV leasing startup Hive Technologies has secured US$30 million to expand its fleet from the current 100 vehicles to 1,000 EVs.Hive leases EVs to Uber and Lyft drivers on a per-mile cost basis, which it claims could potentially be a cheaper option than taking out a loan to purchase a new vehicle. The company currently only operates in California but is expanding to other states. Both Uber and Lyft are aiming to run only on EVs by 2030.That’s it for this edition – we hope you liked it!

727588,2022-01-10T05:00:43,2022-01-12T09:55:46,Circles Life’s ESOP breaks new ground. But is there a trade-off?,circleslifes-esop-breaks-ground-catch,post,"When an ex-employee of a rapidly growing Southeast Asian unicorn was about to cash out his stock options, he noticed that the shares had been wiped from the system, even though they were supposed to be valid until 2029.He later found that the legal fine print said employees had to exercise their options within a year of leaving the company. If not, the options would expire.The employee claims he had not been adequately briefed about this when he was offboarded and wonders whether others have had the same experience.Circles Life co-founder Rameez Ansar / Photo credit: Circles LifeAs Southeast Asia’s startup ecosystem grows rapidly and the demand for talent shoots up, founders have turned to employee stock option plans (ESOPs) to attract talent.Many employees, however, remain skeptical. Indonesia is seen as lacking an ESOP culture despite having the second-highest number of unicorns in the region.Meanwhile, ex-Grab staff in Vietnam belatedly found out that the shares they held would become worthless when the company went public due to regulations, though the company did try to salvage the situation by buying back their shares.Founders, too, are unfamiliar with the nuances of ESOPs. Also, 58% of companies that don’t run these schemes doubt that it’s the right strategy to attract and keep talent, while 51% are unsure about how to implement it, according to a 2021 study by Svested and Saison Capital entitled “State of ESOPs in Southeast Asia.”It’s a chicken-and-egg problem: If ESOPs are poorly run and illiquid, employees won’t find them enticing. And if employees aren’t clamoring for ESOPs, startups won’t implement them.Singapore telco Circles Life is hoping to break a vicious cycle by running an ESOP that it says is “the most generous in the region.”“It’s not true that people here don’t value ESOPs. It’s just that we have to do a better job as a community to help other founders, employees and investors understand how ESOPs are a win-win for everyone,” says Rameez Ansar, co-founder of Circles Life, in an interview with Tech in Asia.A key attraction for the firm is its stock buyback program, which happens roughly every 18 months and allows all employees to sell vested stocks back to the company at regular intervals.The telco’s most recent buyback program – accessible to all employees with over a year’s tenure – was worth $5 million. Circles Life says this was one of the biggest pre-IPO liquidity events in Southeast Asia in recent times.In the past, startup founders preferred to wait for an exit, such as an IPO or a trade sale, before implementing buyback programs.However, in today’s startup scene, where the focus is on talent retention and with more upside from valuation hikes, founders have been issuing buybacks to employees at almost any stage in a company’s growth.Younger startups issue ESOPs when they are short on cash, encouraging employees to sacrifice short-term gain for long-term reward. Later, when a company like Circles Life runs at full speed, stock options reward those who have been with the company since its early days.Circles Life’s approach isn’t without detractors – some ask if the telco can actually afford to keep up its liberal ESOP scheme, while others wonder if it’s approach can be replicated by startups with less funding.An unusual planEvery 12 months, all full-time Circles Life employees, irrespective of rank or tenure, get two months’ worth of stock options as part of their basic compensation. Employees can encash their shares at a price corresponding to the company’s latest valuation, rather than a discounted rate or one that’s tied to a lower valuation from a previous funding round.The firm’s most recent buyback program allows employees with tenure of one year to sell up to 50% of fully vested stock options. At Circles Life, the vesting period – which is the waiting period before employees can own the shares they’re eligible for – is one year. In other companies, this can typically take three or four years.“Space Explorers,” Circles Life’s top-performing employees, get an additional six months’ worth of stocks that vest immediately and at a low strike price – the cost an employee needs to bear to exercise each option.Circles Life’s strike price is around US$1, which is negligible. This is in stark contrast to what most founders said in the Svested and Saison Capital study – they stressed that strike prices were based on the price per share of their latest funding round. The study adds that high strike prices make it difficult for employees to exercise their stock options, making the ESOPs practically “worthless to them.”Ansar says that his company’s investors had a lot of questions about his ESOP proposal, but later came around.He adds that some investors think employees who have just joined a company should not be entitled to a nominal strike price – this effectively translates to getting shares at a discounted price – especially since they haven’t been around since the company’s early days.Ansar highlights, however, that ESOPs are a way to turn employees into “believers.”Pearlyn Yeo, senior design manager at Circles Life, compares the ESOP to “savings you never knew you could have till now.”Further, Ansar says Circles Life’s buyback programs are financed by cash on its balance sheet instead of being linked to a funding round, which typically involves new investors buying out existing shareholders. Employees can also buy company stocks from each other through an internal marketplace.“We believe the right approach for late-stage companies is to set aside at least 3% to 5% of the overall cap table for ESOPs and make it a point to go to investors at least every two years to refresh the pool,” he said. “This is what we’re currently doing.”Circles Life says that its ESOP pool makes up 8% of total shares. Meanwhile, mature startups in Singapore typically allocate 3% to over 20% of their cap table to ESOPs, a scan of VentureCap Insights data shows.That said, ESOP pools between startups may not make for apple-to-apple comparisons. In later-stage startups, some employees would have exercised their shares, which may or may not get taken out of the ESOP pool.In other instances, founders shares may get included in the ESOP pool too. Also, startups with nominal strike prices won’t need as large a pool compared to peers that set high strike prices.Circles Life team / Photo credit: Circles LifeIf all goes well, Circles Life’s employees are set to reap handsome rewards. In a December announcement, the firm highlighted that stocks awarded to employees in the company’s early days had grown over 13x in value, while the business has grown over 50x since launching in 2016.Ansar estimates that if the company listed on the Nasdaq at a US$30 billion valuation today, the top 25 employees currently with the firm – who own the most shares – would collectively hold upwards of US$360 million in stock.“This is our company buying back shares at regular intervals using our own capital and creating liquidity for employees from a position of strength, versus being forced to do so to raise money or as part of a larger fundraise,” he added.ESOP boomAfter a slowdown in 2020, the number of companies executing buybacks has picked up again. Companies are prioritizing talent retention once more and competing in a tightening job market.The recent spate of public listings is also playing a role. More employees are now valuing stock options higher and are more willing to bank on them.See more: Recap: SEA’s biggest tech listings in 2021In the table below, Pravin Jadhav, CEO of Dhan, a technology investment platform, outlines key ESOP features and how founders can design and improve their own programs.While Svested CEO Casper Peh wouldn’t say Circles Life’s ESOP is generous, he believes the founders have foresight and are smart for issuing a unique stock options program.He notes that Circles Life’s biggest competitors are listed companies and that the ESOP is a way for the firm to stand out as its share price has more upside potential compared with the limited growth prospects of listed companies.But what’s the catch?Stock buybacks and ESOPs can be expensive and are sometimes seen by investors as poor use of company resources.In the Svested and Saison Capital study, only 18% of founders said investors had asked them to implement ESOPs. Another downside is that stock options become less attractive when the company in question starts to have less upside value and when an employee has to pay taxes on the stock. In Singapore, taxes are levied at the time employees exercise their options.Buybacks don’t always make employees feel more secure either. If founders are allowed to exercise their options first (without returning them to the pool), then the concern is that employees may be shortchanged for the benefit of executives or investors.Further, while Circles Life’s stock buyback scheme is the first of its kind known to Dan Chong, founder of VC firm Gobi Partners, he wonders whether the ESOP’s short vesting period may keep it from achieving its goal of retaining talent.From an investor’s perspective, Chong says Circles Life’s founders need to be sure that they are using the company’s cash wisely for growth.Looi Qin En, principal of Saison Capital says an ESOP aims to align the incentives of everyone, including founders, employees, and investors.Looi adds that founders and leaders tend to be hands-on in explaining ESOPs to their employees, helping prevent employees from failing to get the returns they’re looking for.Circles Life follows a long line of startups that have rolled out stock option plans – a practice that Silicon Valley companies have used since the 1980s.Ansar says they spent a lot of time looking at Silicon Valley firms like Airbnb and Netflix and the way they integrated ESOPs into the flexible compensation and incentives mix for their employees.For smaller startups, Ansar points out that ESOPs like Circles Life’s are feasible even for companies that are just starting.He has three pointers for such firms: commit to it, start early and include investors in the discussion, and treat it as an important item in the budget. Once a startup has these foundations in place, it must start small, treat its buyback programs like a routine, allocate more money to the ESOP as it grows, and calibrate the company’s expenses along the way.“I hope one day we’ll succeed in creating our own unique version of ESOPs, with Singapore as the hub for world-class employee ownership practices,” Ansar adds.",The digital telco is pushing the boundaries of what staff can get out of their stock options.,698374,Joana Bagano,False,Terence Lee and Arpit Nayak,3,"['Premium Content', 'Startups']","['buyback', 'buyback program', 'circles.life', 'Dhan', 'employee stock options', 'ESOP', 'esops', 'exits', 'flexible compensation', 'IPO', 'liquidity', 'Singapore', 'stock options', 'telco', 'telecom', 'telecommunications']",False,,True,True,True,False,7

But wise parents will always advise their children against rushing it when they’re not ready.The decade-old Traveloka was among the first companies in Southeast Asia to begin the conversation around going public through a SPAC merger when the trend was at a fever pitch. However, just months after the unicorn said it would “marry” Bridgetown, a Hong Kong-based blank-check company, the Indonesian firm pulled the plug on it.In my recent piece, you’ll find out why Traveloka has made the logical move, considering the circumstances surrounding both the SPAC and Traveloka itself.

But to start working as a media writer, she had to sign up for a payroll account with her employer’s designated bank.“It took quite some time before [the bank was] able to start with the process… Eventually, they told me to come back in a week to get the physical card and activate it,” she tells Tech in Asia.Image credit: Timmy LoenWhile this is a typical requirement for new employees in the Philippines, it has been more than a year since the deadly Covid-19 pandemic forced the country into one of the longest lockdowns in the world. Vaccination drives generally prioritized frontliners and health-compromised individuals, while dose availability was an issue.“I was terrified because I was exposing myself to Covid-19,” adds Quiambao, who was not yet vaccinated at the time.The difficulty of opening a bank account is one of the reasons why there are 36.9 million unbanked Filipinos – roughly 47% of the country’s adult population – as of the second quarter of 2021.While 37 banks already incorporated electronic onboarding capabilities as of Q2 2021, some – like the one Quiambao had to sign up with – still required personal appearances to open an account.The entry of six digital banks in the Philippines is expected to solve this problem, as well as other issues that users encounter at traditional banks in the country.The Philippines’ central bank, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), defines a digital bank as an institution offering financial products and services that are “processed end to end through a digital platform and/or electronic channels with no physical branch/sub-branch or branch-lite unit.”But the path for Philippine digibanks may not be a smooth one.Challenges aheadDigital bank executives who spoke to Tech in Asia pointed to the current state of internet connectivity in the Philippines as an issue that’s beyond the control of financial institutions.Because digibanks don’t have a physical branch, customers can only connect with them online, making it harder for those outside big cities to access their services.A telco tower in Camiguin, Philippines. Internet connectivity outside the national capital region still leaves much to be desired, especially in terms of mobile internet stability. Photo credit: 123RF.comAs of January 2021, the country’s internet penetration rate was at 67%, and it ranked sixth among 10 ASEAN countries in terms of internet speed. Given these factors, reaching the unbanked becomes a stretch when digital banks need customers to be online in the first place.“Telcos also have to up their game and build the infrastructure to make it possible for digital to play in those far-off places,” says Albert Tinio, chief commercial officer and co-founder of digital bank GoTyme. The company is a partnership between Philippine conglomerate Gokongwei Group and Singapore-headquartered Tyme.The Philippines’ telco space has long been dominated by Globe Telecom and Smart Communications. However, a new player called Dito Telecommunity entered the market in March with the hope of breaking this duopoly.Globe and Smart are connected to e-wallets GCash and PayMaya, respectively. GCash has teamed up with CIMB Bank, which offers online banking services and has a universal bank license. PayMaya, meanwhile, will launch its digital bank, Maya Bank, in Q1 2022. Maya Bank is under Voyager Innovations, a Philippine tech firm backed by Chinese giant Tencent.Many Filipinos continue to use outdated smartphone models, but these devices can’t support digital banking apps that need to be regularly updated. / Photo credit: 123RF.comAnother hurdle for the sector is how Filipinos tend to hold on to older smartphones, an industry source who requested anonymity tells Tech in Asia. These earlier models, however, can’t support apps that need to be frequently updated. Digital banking apps, in particular, often upgrade their platforms to keep transactions secure.As of 2020, the Philippines had a 72% penetration rate for smartphones, according to a Statista report, though it didn’t mention how old the phones are.Digital banks also have to continue addressing digital hesitancy. Although the number of digital bank account holders is expected to hit 26 million by 2026, there are people like writer Merck Maguddayao who still prefer holding cash over actively transacting online.“I don’t want to put a huge aspect of my life online for security,” he tells Tech in Asia.His security-related misgivings around online banking aren’t unfounded. For example, about 700 account holders of BDO Unibank – one of the country’s largest banks – lost nearly US$1,000 to around US$3,000 after a series of unauthorized transfers in December.The BSP said that “a sophisticated fraud technique” was used, with BDO’s 10-year-old for-phase out system believed to have been exploited.While Maguddayao does have a bank account, he prefers using his debit card to withdraw money from machines. The only time he made a digital transaction was when he bought a computer table to help him work from home amid the pandemic.“If you have easy access to buying stuff online, you might also end up spending more than intended,” he adds.GoTyme representatives and the unnamed industry source agreed that having a tangible means of depositing and withdrawing cash would appease the fears of potential digital banking users. Digital banks such as Singapore-based Tonik and institutions like ING that offer digital banking services are addressing this by providing physical cards that can be used at any ATM.Photo credit: Pixabay.As for GoTyme, it could allow account holders to make deposits and withdrawals at commercial business establishments located at Gokongwei Group properties soon. The Philippine conglomerate has a vast footprint, which includes consumer food and beverage brands, convenience stores, drug stores, malls, and an airline.The shift to digital also brings some risks for banks, “especially when onboarding customers with no credit record,” says Angus Mackintosh, founder of CrossASEAN Research.Existing traditional banks that have digital entities might also end up cannibalizing their own customer bases, he adds.“The idea is to target a different customer base and offer more tailored products such as targeting millennials, or offering buy now, pay later, or targeting micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises which are currently unbanked,” he says. However, traditional players often have difficulty offering such digital-focused services, Mackintosh notes.But as with many other segments, Covid-19 has changed the digital banking landscape. The pandemic pushed several Filipinos to start using e-wallets, driving the country to have the highest adoption rate in Asia Pacific.As work-from-home policies pressed people to transact online, the Philippines’ central bank saw digital payments breach 4 trillion pesos (US$79 billion) in value last year.That said, it’s“a little bit naive to think that people can immediately go from cash to cashless,” warns GoTyme’s Tinio. “That is a fast transition. You need a step in between,” he notes, adding that this is where digital banking comes in.Six is not a crowdIn October 2021, the BSP issued digital bank licenses to only six players to monitor how the local banking space would react to this new type of financial institution.ATM booths at business district in Manila, Philippines / Photo credit: 123RF.comSee also: Mapping SEA’s key digital banking playersThe six entities to get the license include GoTyme, Maya Bank, and Tonik, as well as Overseas Filipino Bank (OFBank), which is under state-owned Land Bank of the Philippines; Union Digital Bank, a subsidiary of UnionBank; and Unobank, a Singapore-based fintech firm.License grantees are given a year to start operations, though OFBank and Tonik are already offering digital bank services as of writing.Nine other applicants for the license were not approved, as “they had not completed the requirements in time,” according to a BSP statement. The central bank did not name these applicants.But players in the space feel there is a need for more digital bank operators in the Philippine market.While the entry of digital banks means more players in the banking space, it is a “misnomer to say it is crowded,” Jojo Malolos, president and CEO of GoTyme, tells Tech in Asia. The executive, who is also a board director of Tyme, adds that the industry has yet to “address the issue of the unbanked.”Having lots of players also helps to accelerate financial inclusion, says Greg Krasnov, founder and CEO of Tonik Bank. “More digital banks and fintech companies are, in fact, a solution to drive Filipinos to become more financially literate and responsible with their money.”That said, don’t expect traditional banks to just step aside as those in the space will also form part of the competition, says CrossASEAN Research’s Mackintosh. Long-time players in Indonesia, for example, are “setting up their own standalone digital banks.”Digital remedy for traditional banking painsExperts contend that the number of players in the Philippines isn’t the biggest pain point. Instead, it’s the processes that potential banking customers have to go through in order to open an account.Besides the required personal appearances, people must also have a valid identification card. Unfortunately, traditional banks differ on the type of IDs that they accept, something that experts hope the recently launched national ID system will help address.Pandemic restrictions rendered once-busy streets empty. / Photo credit:123RF.comHowever, there are still a whole host of other hurdles, such as the need to make repeat branch visits, present a bunch of required documents, and endure long wait times just to get services like a loan. Often, these pain points are not even identified because it has become “routine” for customers, says Tinio. Helping people recognize these issues with commonplace transactions will help them embrace digital banking, he says.“I’ve honestly never met anyone who woke up one day excited to go to their local bank and stay there for hours, just running their errands and transactions,” added Tonik’s Krasnov.Digital banks solves this problem because they don’t need brick-and-mortar branches and their processes are digitalized. Customers just need a valid ID and a smartphone to avail of the platforms’ services. This convenience also extends to Filipinos outside the country, as in the case of OFBankFor Filipinos abroad, “a top priority is sending money to their loved ones and be able to save as well for their future needs,” Leila Martin, president and CEO of OFBank, tells Tech in Asia. These transactions usually need a bank account, which “traditionally would require a physical visit to a bank, go through a lot of documentation, and have at least 500 pesos (US$10) as initial deposit,” she adds.Mobile phones are also the main point of contact for digital banks, which bodes well for traditional financial institutions looking at their digital banking arms as virtual extensions of their offline services.In GoTyme’s case, any branch of Gokongwei-owned convenience store Ministop or pharmacy chain Southstar Drug may be tapped to deliver digital banking services in their respective areas. Ministop and Southstar Drug have more than 500 branches each nationwide. Robinsons Malls, which is also owned by the Gokongwei Group, has 52 locations all over the Philippines as well.“There is also an issue of the maintaining balance. A lot of Filipinos live on small incomes, but there are usually minimum amounts needed to open and maintain an account with traditional banks,” says the anonymous industry source.Accounts with 5,000 pesos (US$98.78) and below in deposits make up 68% of the total number of bank accounts in the country, according to recent BSP figures. This amount is the average minimum balance required by most banks in the country to open and maintain an account.Considering that the minimum wage in the Philippines is between US$6.22 to US$10.6 per day for non-agricultural work, gross monthly salaries would be between US$124.48 to US$212.21. This makes it hard for most workers to open and maintain accounts with traditional banks.As a result, digital and online banking players become viable options for users who are eager to start saving, as they allow new accounts to be opened with zero maintaning balance.While there are Filipinos like Quiambao who are forced to make at least two trips to a branch just to open an account or people like Maguddayao who are hesitant to transact online, there are also those who are not even eligible to open their own accounts. But thanks to technology, banking may become more convenient in the Philippines.Currency converted from Philippine peso to US dollar: US$1 = 50.61 pesos","Digital bank licenses were granted to six players in the Philippines, where banking is slow and inaccessible.

Because the Spanish terms for “in leather” and “naked” sound extremely similar, Braniff ended up telling the Hispanic market to “fly naked.”Such gaffes are a clear reminder of why effective and accurate communication is vital, especially in a globalized world.However, language barriers remain a perennial issue in international business communications. Despite English being considered the world’s top business language, less than 400 million people use it as a first language.“This language barrier can lead to frictions in collaboration, productivity, customer service, and global expansion,” says Fardad Zabetian, CEO and co-founder of Kudo, a multilingual web conferencing platform. Miscommunication could lead companies to miss out on crucial business opportunities or damage their reputation.Indeed, 64% of respondents in a 2012 survey conducted by the Economist Intelligence Unit said that differences in language and culture made it difficult to gain market share in new territories.More harm than goodWhile companies have several options to overcome the language barrier, not all are effective. In fact, some could even create new problems.For instance, companies might rely on bilingual employees to act as interpreters. But because they aren’t professionally trained, technical material and linguistic subtleties that could change the meaning of a word or sentence might escape their notice, Zabetian explains.Fardad Zabetian, CEO and co-founder of Kudo / Photo credit: KudoAdding interpretation to an employee’s job responsibilities also hurts their productivity and wastes key resources. At the big-picture level, this distracts a company from its core growth efforts.To help with written translations, some businesses use automated online translation tools like DeepL. However, these tools tend to fall short when unfamiliar cultural nuances need to be taken into account, particularly when there’s no proper oversight from professional interpreters.Being aware of these nuances is especially important in countries with high-context cultures such as Japan, China, and France, where people rely on underlying context, meaning, and tone during communication. Any of these elements could alter the way customers perceive messages.The inability of automated tools to consider cultural contexts could potentially cause misunderstandings and communication errors that are damaging to the company’s brand.“Simultaneous interpretation requires emotional intelligence and the ability to produce ‘neutral’ language to match the audience’s cultural context,” observes Zabetian. Get a professionalUltimately, the best way for businesses to overcome the language barrier is by using professional interpreters, according to Zabetian. In this regard, companies can look to service providers like Kudo.“Using professional interpreters with experience in the subject matter will ensure the message is communicated accurately and matches the audience’s cultural sensitivities,” he explains.Online platforms also allow for interpretation to be conducted remotely – a great boon for companies that need to quickly reach a global audience. Kudo, for its part, hosts a marketplace that allows companies to book interpreters for multilingual meetings up to two hours prior to an event.A Kudo interpreter conducts remote simultaneous interpretation / Photo credit: KudoThis feature came in handy in 2018, when the Inter-American Telecommunication Commission (CITEL) took part in a two-week-long conference in Dubai. The organization wanted to hold daily briefing sessions for its members during the conference, but that required interpretating information into English and Spanish.CITEL members were able to attend briefings dubbed in the language of their choice through remote interpretation services provided by Kudo. This allowed CITEL to help its members make the most out of their time at the conference. CITEL also got onboarding assistance prior to the event to ensure that it could learn to use Kudo’s platform effectively.Using professional interpretation services also shows that companies genuinely want to understand their audience’s point of view. In situations that involve sensitive information, such as health concerns or legal matters, this sincerity is instrumental in winning the other party’s trust.For example, a study published in the Health, Risk &amp; Society journal found that patient trust in doctors was linked with their willingness to engage in medical procedures or alternative therapies in which the long-term risks were unclear. This shows the importance of sincerity in communication – something that may be lost in ineffective translation.During meetings, companies can overcome the language barrier and smooth out communication if they can provide a good interpretation experience.In this regard, AI-powered tools like live captioning could be useful in meetings when simultaneous interpretation is necessary, as they allow participants to quickly identify who is talking. It can also help promote inclusivity for variety of users, including those who are hard of hearing.Apart from live-captioning capabilities, Kudo’s platform offers other AI solutions such as an interpreter assistance tool. Thanks to this feature, interpreters can generate a glossary of translated terms from documents, web pages, and keywords before meetings take place. By planning ahead, they can ensure that the interpretation – even when it includes technically difficult subjects – can flow smoothly and accurately.Overcoming the final obstacleThe demand for bilingual capabilities in international business communications grew by more than 2x in five years. As such, platforms that provide interpretation and translation services will have a sizable impact on business capabilities.“For businesses looking to globalize, interpretation is essential,” says Zabetian. “It gives clients and partners a better overall experience, and it facilitates communication and collaboration without anything being lost in translation.”He believes that remote simultaneous interpretation platforms like Kudo will eventually become seamlessly integrated into all business communications, making multilingual interactions the norm. When that happens, the world can move towards a more “promising” and interconnected future.“The language barrier is the last obstacle that must be overcome for people and businesses to truly connect on a global scale,” he contends.Kudo is a live interpretation platform that gives users the power to be understood by allowing them to engage in their preferred language, removing language barriers and easing communication.To find out more about Kudo, schedule a demo on its website.This content was produced by Tech in Asia Studios, which connects brands with Asia’s tech community.

We break down the big and messy topics of Asia’s tech and startup community. Get the newsletter in your inbox everyday with a Premium subscription.Hello reader,When I joined Tech In Asia, one of the first few articles I wrote was about AI company SenseTime. Writing the piece was an interesting process, not just because I was learning the ropes but also because it gave me an opportunity to dive deeper into China’s tech scene. It gave me a good view of how AI could potentially drive the country’s healthcare systems forward and made me realize that the technology was real and not just something from movies like Terminator.As a rapidly growing startup, SenseTime has made it onto our listicle story for today, which details the top 50 rising startups in China. Here’s a look at the explosive growth of the next wave of Chinese tech companies.Today we look at,50 Chinese startups on the fast track to successA hair removal company grows its coffers with new fundsOther newsy highlights such as AirAsia’s rebranding and ex-TaniHub CEO Ivan Arie Sustiawan’s new venture fund.Premium summaryDon’t stop them now, they’re having a good timeImage credit: Timmy LoenThe companies on our most recent listicle might not always be the first ones to come to mind when someone mentions “Chinese tech,” but they’re still very much powerhouses in their own right. Who knows, maybe one day we’ll be mentioning the likes of Leapstack or ZTO Freight in the same breath as Alibaba and Tencent.Health first: Many of the companies on this list are involved with either healthcare technology, biopharmaceuticals, or other biotechnologies. Out of the 50 companies on the list, 18 of them fall into the above categories. These include startups such as Beion, Navid, and Bestop, among others.Chips in China: Firms that produce semiconductors make up another major sector on our list. If you’re interested in semiconductor manufacturing in China, you should keep your eye on these growing companies: Pure Semiconductor, Sicreat, Yuntu Semiconductor, GeoforceChip, Lizhu Intelligence, and TIH Microelectronics.Sticking out: While most of the companies on the list have something to do with fancy tech like AI or big data, Youwomen Duck Neck sauntered onto this list as a seller of lo mei, a Chinese noodle dish.

This latest development comes on top of other efforts such as the launch of AirAsia Ride, the firm’s ride-hailing service, and the impending release of its food delivery service in Indonesia, which is set to be unveiled later this year.4️⃣ Forget the K-wave, here’s the Shopee waveThe Singapore-based ecommerce platform is hiring around 40 employees in South Korea. While the company began operations in the country last year, its South Korean website is geared specifically toward helping merchants sell in markets where Shopee is present, rather than serving as a consumer-facing platform. One of its current job listings also mentions the Japanese market, suggesting that the platform is considering a move there.5️⃣ Giving backFormer TaniHub CEO Ivan Arie Sustiawan, along with three other founding partners, is launching a new seed-stage venture fund to invest in promising Indonesian founders.

Delivered every Thursday via email and through the Tech in Asia website, this free newsletter breaks down the biggest stories and trends in ecommerce. If you’re not a subscriber, get access by registering here.The new year is here, and we’re back to talk about all things ecommerce.During the holidays, I had time to browse the Shopee app almost daily. In Vietnam – where I’m based – the influence of the shopping platform’s parent firm, Sea Group, is astonishing.Shopee is so popular among local consumers that “find it on Shopee” has become a catchphrase. ShopeeFood, which is a rebrand of local food delivery player Now (bought by Sea Group in 2017 for US$64 million), is in a head-to-head battle with GrabFood. Similarly, Garena, Sea’s digital entertainment arm, has been among the top game developers and publishers in the country for about a decade.The name Sea Group might not ring a bell with end consumers, many of whom are already part of its thriving ecosystem. But that’s not an issue. The company has been known for quietly making moves in different segments, conquering markets at a speed that puzzles everyone.In 2009, the group’s co-founders – Forrest Li, Gang Ye, and David Chen – operated Garena out of a shophouse in Singapore. But besides the trio, who else is steering the wheels of the current Sea Group empire?For this week’s The Big Story, we have diverged a bit from our usual approach. My colleague Budi Sutrisno maps out Sea Group’s key decision-makers in our org chart. How do they fit into the company’s ambitions, which evidently stretch far beyond Southeast Asia?Meanwhile, Bukalapak, one of Shopee’s local rivals in Indonesia, has reshuffled its leadership team. Our reporter, Aditya Hadi Pratama, analyzes the implications of its CEO’s sudden resignation to join the government just months after the ecommerce firm debuted on the public market.— Huong (Hanoi, Vietnam)THE BIG STORYOrg Chart: The people helming Sea GroupImage credit: Timmy LoenWe look at the captains leading Sea Group as the firm makes major moves in digital banking and in markets like Latin America and Europe.THE HOT TAKEWhat’s behind the resignation of Bukalapak’s CEO?Former Bukalapak CEO Muhammad Rachmat Kaimuddin (fourth from left)/ Photo credit: BukalapakHere’s what happened:Muhammad Rachmat Kaimuddin, the CEO of recently listed Indonesian ecommerce major Bukalapak, submitted his resignation letter to the firm on December 28.He immediately joined the Indonesian Coordinating Ministry for Maritime and Investment Affairs as a special advisor.Bukalapak has nominated its chief operating officer, Willix Halim, to become the company’s new CEO.Here’s our take:“My long-term goal was to join an organization that can make an impact on society by doing good, and I really like what these guys [Bukalapak] are doing.”“My vision is to build a strong foundation for Bukalapak so it can become a ‘phoenix,’ a company that can last for 100 years or longer.”Those are statements from Kaimuddin when he was appointed as the chief executive of Bukalapak in late 2019, replacing the company’s founder Achmad Zaky. On top of that, he also pledged to make the company IPO-ready, a feat he was able to accomplish.Bukalapak headquarters in Jakarta / Photo credit: BukalapakKaimuddin’s two-year stint as Bukalapak’s CEO was fairly short. Median CEO tenure globally is around five years, according to PwC. His resignation took place only months after Bukalapak went public as well.Similar to other tech companies, Bukalapak implemented a dual-class share structure in the beginning. However, as the company set to go public early last year, it abolished the classification and converted its stock to common shares.The Indonesian Financial Services Authority (OJK) didn’t allow a company with multiple voting shares to go public until late last year, after Bukalapak launched its IPO.This means Kaimuddin’s 0.1% share in Bukalapak only gives him a small influence over the company. Halim, the newly nominated CEO, has the highest number of shares in Bukalapak compared to the company’s other C-level executives, but he still doesn’t make the top five shareholders overall.Many tech companies in Indonesia, such as Gojek, Tokopedia, and Traveloka, have raised several funding rounds that have diluted their founders’ shares. Without voting shares, a founder or CEO would be more easily removed if his or her leadership is questioned by other shareholders.Stability in question?Bukalapak’s share price plunged 6% to 424 rupiah (around US$0.03) per share after the news of Kaimuddin’s resignation was released. But it surged back to 500 rupiah on January 4 after the company announced its investment in Allo Bank’s right issue process.In Q3 2021, Bukalapak reported US$33.8 million in revenue – a 58% jump compared to the same period in the previous year – following an acceleration in its online-to-offline business, Mitra Bukalapak. The company’s operating loss for the nine months of 2021 also narrowed by 13% to US$84.9 million.See also: Bukalapak’s financial performance in 8 chartsBukalapak’s cash position grew from US$191 million in Q2 2021 to 23 trillion rupiah (around US$1.6 billion) at the end of the quarter, following the firm’s public listing.If the funds are used effectively, the company can pursue other business lines. Since its IPO, the firm has expanded to or invested in the blockchain, digital bank, and bookkeeping sectors.Despite its management reshuffle, the company’s share price will be safe as long as Bukalapak can continue to perform. That’s why its next financial report will be crucial.— Aditya (Jakarta, Indonesia)NEWS YOU SHOULD KNOWCheck out Tech in Asia’s coverage of the ecommerce scene here.1️⃣ Sea Group plans to increase the voting rights of CEO Forrest Li and reduce that of investor Tencent.

Who are the key decision-makers? How are the teams organized? What does it tell us about the company’s priorities? We continue this series with leading consumer internet company Sea.When Sea Group started in 2009, there were hardly any hints that it would eventually become the poster child of Southeast Asian tech. Co-founders Forrest Li, Gang Ye, and David Chen ran Garena – now the group’s worldwide digital entertainment arm – out of a shophouse in Singapore, before making the game-changing move of diving into fintech and ecommerce with SeaMoney in 2014 and Shopee in 2015.Still, it seems that the company is nowhere near done. The next frontier seems to be digital banking: In December 2020, Sea Group was awarded a digital full bank license in Singapore and swiftly acquired an Indonesian bank (which then became SeaBank) within weeks.Sea Group is also making a mark outside its core Southeast Asia market. Shopee is thriving in Latin America, especially Brazil, and is eyeing markets like India, Poland, and Spain.Sea also: Visualizing Sea’s rapid riseWhile Li has served as Sea’s CEO since it was founded, Gang and Chen have held various roles throughout the journey.Gang was the group’s CTO between 2010 and 2016 before replacing Chen as group COO in January 2017. Chen also transitioned from the group’s chief of staff to Shopee’s chief product officer by December 2019.As Sea diversified further, so did its internal structure. Chris Feng, who joined Sea in March 2014 to lead its mobile game business, was a major addition to the group. Feng now leads two of Sea’s major entities, serving as Shopee’s CEO since July 2015 and as the CEO of SeaMoney since March 2020.Recently, Feng was also appointed president of Sea Group, effective January 1, 2022. He continues to lead Shopee and SeaMoney and reports directly to Li.Here are a few more observations:Nick Nash, before forming private equity firm Asia Partners, was Sea Group’s president. He resigned in 2018, and the position remained vacant until Feng’s appointment.Jin Oh, the former CEO of Garena, also resigned in 2018. Later, Terry Zhao, who had served in several senior roles at Garena, was promoted to lead the gaming arm as its president.While Sea Group has expanded into numerous countries within and outside Southeast Asia, Maneerut Anulomsombut (Nok), Sea Thailand CEO, is the group’s only country-specific CEO.Alan Hellawell, former group chief strategy officer, was another C-level executive in Sea Group’s history.Two relative veterans at the company are leading Shopee’s charge into Latin America. Jianghong Liu spent over five years at Shopee – most recently as head of cross-border ecommerce – before becoming head of Shopee Mexico. Pine Kyaw spent four years as the country head for Shopee Vietnam before taking on the same role for Brazil.ShopeeFoodis one of Shopee’s newer productsbut it’s unclear whether a specific executive oversees the food delivery service.

We break down the big and messy topics of Asia’s tech and startup community. Get the newsletter in your inbox everyday with a Premium subscription.Hello reader,We’re well into the first week of 2022, and I hope you are sticking to your resolutions. The “new year, new me” phenomenon is rife, with exercise regimes and healthy eating habits being trumpeted across social media.Funnily enough, the uncanny tradition of resolutions has lasted for millennia – some believe the ancient Babylonians were the first people to make New Year’s resolutions some 4,000 years ago.The new year wonderfully sets the stage for fresh starts and, understandably, it’s easy to give in to the temptation of seeking a “newer” version of yourself. But resolutions aren’t always beneficial, and there are times when it’s better to stay on the path you’ve already set for yourself.In our premium story pick today, you’ll see that the top-funded startups in Southeast Asia very rarely pivot from their core businesses, especially once the funding starts rolling in.Today we look at,The top-funded startups and tech companies in Southeast Asia A tweak in Sea Group’s ownership structureOther newsy highlights such as cybersecurity checks for Chinese firms listing overseas and Reliance’s big bond saleAlso, if you’re an entrepreneur looking for funding, fill in this form to get your company featured on our list of fundraising startups.Premium summaryThe investors’ darlings of SEAImage credit: Timmy LoenFunding is the bread and butter of any startup ecosystem and is celebrated as a major milestone for a startup. While it may seem that most budding startups bag a funding round or two with relative ease, the difficulty of working towards and securing funding should not be understated. The countless stories of startup empires beginning from cramped garages exist for a reason.Having said that, let’s look at some startups that have put in the hard yards and are now reaping the rewards of their labor.In a league of its own: Sea Group is a Southeast Asian tech behemoth with businesses spanning across gaming, ecommerce, fintech and, possibly, the metaverse. However, it did not reach the lofty valuation of nearly US$100 billion without massive funding. Sea Group leads our list with US$9 billion in funding – double that of logistics firm J&amp;T Express, which comes in second.Dominant ecosystems: Apart from Vietnam’s The CrownX,  the top 10 startups in our list are from either Singapore or Indonesia. Sea Group, Grab, Trax Retail, Emeritus, and Ninja Logistics represent the Lion City, while J&amp;T Express, Bukalapak and GoTo Group are from the region’s largest archipelago.An anomaly: The 20 top-funded startups and tech companies in Southeast Asia are packed with major players from various sectors. Marketplaces, fintech and logistics are some of investors’ favorite industries. However, only one crypto-focused company got a spot: Bitkub is a platform that allows individuals to buy, sell, and store cryptocurrencies.Read more: Meet the 50 top-funded startups and tech companies in Southeast AsiaNews spotlightPower playPhoto credit: ReutersIssuing shares with voting rights – also known as dual-class shares – is a popular way for founders to retain control of the company after it has gone public. Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook), Ford, Berkshire Hathaway, and Google are some famous companies that follow this ownership structure.Here, we look at how Sea Group leverages the flexibility of this structure to ease any potential concerns over its operations in India.Consolidating power: The company plans to increase the voting power rights of CEO Forrest Li to 57% from the current 54%. His voting power will go up as each class B ordinary share will see an increase in voting power from three votes to 15 votes.Loosening ties: Sea will reduce the voting power rights of investor Tencent to less than 10%. At the same time, the Chinese tech titan will convert all its class B ordinary shares to class A ordinary shares. Once the conversion is completed, Li will own all of Sea’s class B ordinary shares.Context: Last month, the company’s ecommerce arm Shopee faced calls for a ban in India as a local trade body alleged that Sea had “Chinese roots” and was operated by Tencent. The Indian government has previously banned several Chinese apps including short-video platform TikTok and has taken a tough stance on firms backed heavily by Chinese investors.Quick bytes1️⃣ A lifeline for PulseChain Debrief, a Singapore-based media platform dedicated to crypto, has raised US$900,000 in a seed round.

Delivered every Wednesday via email and through the Tech in Asia website, this free newsletter breaks down the biggest stories and trends in fintech. If you’re not a subscriber, get access by registering here.Hello there,Happy New Year! We hope the past few days were restful for you. I sure did enjoy unplugging for a good week and a half while our office closed for a year-end break.But back to the grind:“Feature or product?” was something that many people asked about buy now, pay later (BNPL) as the trend swept across the globe.It’s a fair question. After all, assuming all things are constant, are you as a consumer more likely to try a new product or service from a platform you already use, or try a whole new application altogether?If you’re like me and prefer using apps in silos – i.e., having one app per service – you might find yourself eventually running low on real estate on your smartphone’s homepage, or needlessly scrolling through pages of apps just to locate the one you need.The early wage access (EWA) sector is grappling with the same dilemma. This is particularly evident in Indonesia, where pure-play companies from GagiGesa and Wagely to established peer-to-peer lenders, staffing platforms, and software companies are flocking to the space, as my colleague Ardi writes in this week’s big story.(We’ve covered the EWA model from a regional perspective and the billion dollar opportunity it affords in an earlier story, so do check that out if you haven’t.)The answer to that question – at least in the BNPL space – has become clearer in recent months, as tech juggernauts such as Apple, PayPal, and Block (formerly Square) have acquired BNPL outfits to provide the service on top of their existing hardware, payment, or merchant offerings. These incumbents could have a real edge over younger BNPL firms, owing to the sheer size of their consumer and enterprise customer bases, as well as the pools of data available to them.The same could apply in the EWA space. Will software firms that can tap existing relationships with enterprise clients beat EWA-focused startups to the punch? Read on to find out.Meanwhile, our analysis this week features CitaDAO, a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform for real estate that has the potential to change the way people invest in properties.— MelissaTHE BIG STORYIs earned wage access Indonesia’s latest hot ticket?Image credit: Timmy LoenWhile startups like GajiGesa and Wagely have stolen the spotlight in the earned wage access segment, numerous VC-backed companies have quietly stepped into the arena.THE HOT TAKEReal estate ownership on the blockchainHere’s what’s going to happen:CitaDAO, a DeFi platform for real estate, will launch its first “introducing real estate on-chain (IRO)” process this Friday, Jan. 7, for a freehold commercial building in the UK.During the IRO process, community members determine if a property will be tokenized by committing USDC, a US-dollar stablecoin.Built on the Ethereum ecosystem, CitaDAO says that it overcomes the frictions of owning physical real estate such as illiquidity and high costs.Individual property owners can list their real estate on the CitaDAO platform and mint their own real estate NFTs.Token holders own a fraction of the title deed of the underlying real estate through an ERC20 real estate token (RET).Here’s what it means:Real estate is an age-old way of building and preserving wealth, whether through buying actual properties or investing in real estate investment trusts (REITs). CitaDAO is taking a new approach to the investment vehicle by breaking up real estate title deeds into smaller pieces and selling them as blockchain tokens (a process called fractionalizing).Photo credit: CitaDAOIt’s worth noting that the division of assets in real estate isn’t new. REITs, for instance, are another – albeit analog – way of breaking up properties into affordable chunks that can be owned and traded by retail investors on a stock exchange.CitaDAO’s differentiation is that it is breaking up these properties on a blockchain, making it easier for people around the world to own its real estate portfolio. And while each REIT consists of multiple properties, CitaDAO issues tokens for individual assets.Through an IRO event, interested investors can commit their interest by staking USDC, a US-dollar stablecoin. Following a successful event, RETs are distributed to holders based on their amounts staked, effectively giving each token holder a piece of real estate – or, more accurately, a piece of its title deed.This piece gives RET holders the right to buy out all other token holders and to legally redeem the full title deed of the underlying property.The organization also plans to issue a separate CitaDAO token that gives holders the ability to vote on its decisions. It will also allocate 2% of every property it lists to the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), giving token holders exposure to its entire portfolio.CitaDAO is confident that a majority of high-quality real estate will inevitably be tokenized as assets. The DAO says that it has a pipeline of US$240 million worth of real estate that will be tokenized within the next six months.CitaDAO isn’t the only firm tokenizing real estate: Shareable Assets is a Singapore-based asset tokenization platform which has issued real estate-backed security tokens based on physical residential and hospitality properties in the UK.Seoul-based property investment platform Kasa also issues digital asset-backed securities that represent fractional ownership of commercial properties, which can be traded on the Kasa exchange. It plans to launch an asset-backed securities platform in Singapore this year.Commercial buildings in Seoul / Photo credit: 123RFLandlords are constantly on the hunt for new sources of capital and higher yields, so it’s no surprise that real estate sits at the forefront of tokenization.It’s worth noting that even within fractionalized real estate, there are different business models. Some platforms purchase the real estate before tokenizing it, while CitaDAO simply transfers the title deed for the real estate from the existing landlord to a special purpose vehicle.CitaDAO’s offering could change DeFi in the following ways:Any landlord can list their properties on the platform (after going through verification and anti-money laundering/know-your-customer checks), making the model highly scalable.As the ecosystem of DeFi products around real estate grows, RETs can be used in other DeFi applications. For example, RETs can form part of an index token for investors that want exposure to diverse assets. Borrowers could also offer their RETs as collateral.CitaDAO could offer a way to stabilize crypto markets. Given that property values often appreciate over time and are less volatile than cryptocurrencies, RETs could form the backing for a stablecoin that also hedges against inflation. It also promises to supply token holders with access to additional yield in the form of rental incomes.But there are important legal and regulatory concerns to consider. Say RETs are successfully awarded to 1,000 different token holders. Would all of these token holders’ names be listed on the property’s title deed at the local city council level? If not, will they be listed in any legal documents?Also, after an IRO event, who owns the property? How is ownership split between the original landlord and RET holders? Does the RET holder have a right to a property’s cash flow?But the hardest questions will arise months or maybe years down the road, when the actual property exchanges hands. If stamp duties are incurred, does each token holder share in the cost? Are property taxes split among all token holders? In the event of a downturn where the valuation of the property falls sharply – or worse still, is foreclosed by a bank – what happens to each token?There’s also selection and exclusion biases built in. There’s a higher chance that landlords who seek capital streams in alternative routes – such as through tokenization – own assets that are less appealing than those included in REITs.Accountability will remain a key question as DAOs proliferate and mature. According to CitaDAO, a property manager will be appointed to lease and manage the real estate. This manager is chosen after inviting all “qualified property managers” on the DAO to submit proposals including their projections for expected rent, operating costs, and the property management fee for the upcoming year.The property manager who submits the proposal with the most optimal metrics is automatically appointed, while manage​​rs who significantly underperform are automatically replaced by the person with the next best proposal. While such an approach certainly decentralizes authority, a question here is whether metrics like track record and qualifications should also be taken into account.If you enjoyed this read, you can check out our previous analysis on MeanDAO and its money streaming protocol here.

But after hearing the pitch, Dirgayusa – who manages over 500 employees for the Jakarta-based hospitality firm he worked for – was unconvinced and turned down the offer.“We had not done any internal analysis or survey on whether EWA is needed or not,” he says. Questions over the startup’s legal standing and the pricing also factored into the company’s decision, he adds.But while this was Dirgayusa’s first conversation with an EWA provider, it probably won’t be his last.GajiGesa founders (from left) Vidit Agarwal and Martyna Malinowska with Indonesia general manager Ade Yuandah Saragih (right) / Photo credit: GajiGesaIn the past 12 months, Indonesia has seen companies flock to the EWA space from different verticals, all attempting to win over employers by giving workers instant access to their wages even before their payday.The media spotlight has largely fallen upon companies like GajiGesa, Wagely, which are spearheaded by high-profile founders and have earned interest from notable global VC firms. However, a significant number of other startups have tiptoed their way into the space as well.Financial advisory platform Halofina has rolled out Halogaji to tap into the EWA sector, while peer-to-peer lenders KoinWorks and Modalku have also jumped on the bandwagon with their platforms KoinGaji and Modal Kasbon, respectively. Alami, a Sharia-compliant P2P platform, is also piloting a similar product.In the parallel segment of human resource information systems (HRIS), Jojonomic has launched a platform called Gajian on Demand, and software company Mekari says it is set to launch an EWA-like product under its employee benefits platform Mekari Flex.Similarly, staffing startup Workmate has started offering EWA services to selected clients, while outsourcing platform MyRobin has launched a similar product for its blue-collar partners and (potentially) external users.The bullishness in the sector is understandable. In a previous story, we estimated EWA to be a billion-dollar opportunity in Southeast Asia, with Indonesia taking the largest slice of the pie.The country is home to the biggest underbanked and unbanked population in the region, with only 23% of its some 270 million citizens having full access to banking services.Among the underbanked are lower-income workers, who live from paycheck to paycheck – many on minimum wage. For them, the EWA option would serve as a safer alternative to the likes of loan sharks.Crowd pullerThe arrival of several new players into the vertical makes sense, says GajiGesa co-founder and CEO Vidit Agrawal. Given the interesting business model and huge market opportunity, Agrawal says that other startups have tried to “copy” GajiGesa, which claims to be the pioneer in the space.That said, many of its peers point to overseas EWA companies as their inspirations. Wagestream, a UK-based firm and investor in GajiGesa, has raised almost $80 million in total funding while Payactiv in the US is reportedly valued at over $500 million. Some also argue that the move to offer EWA products is simply an extension of their existing services that puts them in an advantageous position.Indonesian welding workers taking part in a specified skilled workers training program/ Photo credit: Indonesia Welding Association (API)KoinWorks, for example, launched KoinGaji as an additional product to strengthen its position as a “super financial app” for SMEs in Indonesia. Other than EWA, its array of financial services includes working capital loans, invoice financing, and supply chain financing.Similarly, Finch Capital-backed Halofina sees EWA as a sub-vertical in the larger game of digital wealth management, an arena it entered when it launched its financial planner and robo-advisory app in 2017.“Since the beginning, our mission is to help people in managing their money better, so the strategy to expand into employee financial wellness (including EWA) is aligned with our core mission,” says Halofina co-founder and CEO Adjie Wicaksana.While fintech serves as a convenient segue for companies to foray into EWA, several industry players point out that software-as-a-service companies can make notable strides in the field due to their existing relationships with employers.Mekari, for example, claims that over 35,000 businesses have used at least one of its SaaS solutions, with over 3,000 specifically using its HRIS and payroll software. It also launched Mekari Flex in 2020, which is closely related to EWA. The company’s imminent rollout of its EWA product would then be a simple matter of cross-selling to existing clients, which would likely give the company a considerable head start in the industry.“We hope that their employees will be happier and not fall into predatory loans. HRs will also benefit because it can boost employee retention,” says Mekari CEO Suwandi Soh.Observing the increasingly crowded EWA space, 1982 Ventures – a fintech-focused VC firm that has invested in Wagely – says that the segment will not be a “winner takes all” game. However, he questions the fate of those that treat EWA as a mere side business.“Focus is key to win any market. EWA is hot, and many of these other players are just getting on the bandwagon,” says 1982 Ventures partner Herston Powers.Same service, different approachThe emergence of a handful of EWA players in a short period of time can be seen as a validation of the opportunity in the space, but it also indicates that there’s a pretty low barrier to entry.“The product needed to provide EWA is fairly simple. When we closed our first client, we just made use of WhatsApp and did disbursals manually,” says Gajiku co-founder and CEO Sherman Tanuwidjaja. “This allows new providers to easily come in and launch an MVP (minimum viable product) in weeks.”Gajiku, which is backed by VC firms including AC Ventures and Sampoerna, says its approach differs from those of its peers. While companies like GajiGesa and Wagely follow the Wagestream model (aka being an employee financial wellness app), Gajiku caters to employers through its enterprise suites, which currently include payroll disbursal, as well as attendance tracking and loan management modules.However, Jojonomic, Mekari, KoinWorks, and Modalku all appear to zero in on employers as well.These differences in approach, among other things, impact how startups monetize their businesses. While employee-focused EWA solutions like GajiGesa and Halogaji largely levy its fees on employers, Gajiku and fellow employer-focused EWA services mostly charge employees for the withdrawals they make using the platforms.Given the enormous size of the market, both approaches could prosper in the EWA space, according to YC Ng, a partner at VC firm AC Ventures.Wagely co founders (from left): Tobias Fischer, Sasanadi Ruka, Kevin Hausburg / Photo credit: WagelyIt is likely, he reasons, that companies will find themselves gravitating toward different segments, as the “the behavior of employers and employees of a big enterprise is very different to an SME, which in turn is also very different to an MSME.”For the moment, though, it seems as if most companies in the EWA space are targeting the same demand base. GajiGesa and Wagely both claim to be the leading and biggest players in the field.Both firms have channeled all of their resources and efforts into the EWA business while also building other related products and capabilities.Wagely aims to be the go-to financial wellness platform for workers, while Gajigesa wants to eventually become a holistic employee wellness platform for workers. The success of Wagestream and Payactiv serve as benchmarks for their business model.As for the group of players expanding into EWA from an existing offering, only time will tell whether their new business warrants larger resources and investments or perhaps even being spun off into a separate business. As one founder who requested anonymity contends, having EWA as an additional product is – for the moment – the best way to tap into the opportunity.“For other countries, it seems that EWA can be a stand-alone product. In Indonesia, it is yet to be seen,” the person says.","While startups like GajiGesa and Wagely have stolen the spotlight in the EWA segment, numerous VC-backed companies have quietly stepped into the arena.",586001,Ardi Wirdana,True,Putra Muskita and Jaclyn Tiu,0,"['Analysis', 'Fintech', 'Premium Content']","['earned wage access', 'fintech', 'gajigesa', 'gajiku', 'halofina', 'Indonesia', 'Koinworks', 'Wagely']",False,,True,True,True,False,6

The former CEO previously made several angel investments into early-stage startups such as Jaring Pangan and Eratani, both agritech firms.Championing local foundersAt a time when the Indonesian startup scene appears to have become more favorable to founders from privileged families and those with overseas educational backgrounds, Tunnelerate is keen to “level the playing field” for brilliant local founders that may not have the same privileges.“We have met numerous founders from regions who have great ideas but maybe have found that the doors have always been closed on them. We hope to give a different color to the ecosystem,” says Afifa.The firm says it will be curating top founders from different regions across Indonesia to join its accelerator program, where they will be given access to mentors and capital support.The accelerator will select up to 15 startups for its first of two cohorts this year, which will begin in the second quarter of 2022. Of the participating startups, up to five companies will receive investments from the Tunnelerate fund.Those that become portfolio companies of the firm will be given additional strategic and operational support from the Tunnelerate partners, who have all had extensive experience as business operators.“We understand that being a founder is not easy, that difficult things will happen when you try to build a company. So we will put trust in them and be there for them through the ups and the downs,” says Sustiawan.Leveraging the power of angelsStartups that join Tunnelerate’s portfolio will also receive support from the VC firm’s group of angel LPs.Sustiawan says the LP base of Tunnelerate’s maiden fund will be largely made up of angel investors. Many of them are veteran local entrepreneurs who are eager to adapt with the times and pass on their trade to the next generations.These profiles of LPs are plentiful in Indonesia, Sustiawan adds, but are largely untapped by the ecosystem, perhaps due to their “different” way of working.“These kinds of people require a different approach. They are humble, so you need to show humility with them and be down to earth. Meetings with them take place in a rumah makan Padang (traditional Padang restaurant), instead of five-star hotels,” he explains.These angels, who each put in a minimum of US$100,000 into the Tunnelerate fund, will be available for direct chats and sessions with the founders arranged by the VC.“These are people who have been in the business for 20 years to 30 years in their respective fields. There are so many things that these people can teach to founders. We hope that these angels will not just be investors, but also support these founders,” says Afifa.","Tunnelerate will be targeting a corpus of US$10 million for its maiden fund.

726805,2022-01-03T01:55:32,2022-01-05T08:06:41,Meet the players fighting plastic scourge in SEA,meet-players-fighting-plastic-scourge-sea,visual-story,"Southeast Asian countries throw away an estimated US$6 billion every year in recoverable or recyclable single-use plastics.That figure’s set to soar as environmental priorities get sidetracked by health concerns around the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.For Southeast Asia, the deluge of plastic waste is a pressing environmental and health risk, as well as a lost opportunity to tap into the circular economy. But innovators are gradually waking up to the possibilities, and their solutions could be the key to solving the crisis.Can this green gold rush also help Southeast Asia finally kick its plastic habit? In this visual story, Tech in Asia highlights the region’s nascent ecosystem of plastic waste startups.The rise of plastic alchemistsMost of the 47 startups tackling plastic waste identified by Tech in Asia and The Incubation Network, a Singapore-based impact initiative, reside in just four out of eleven ASEAN member states.Players in the region operate across all stages of the plastic waste life cycle but mainly fall into two major categories:Alternative plastics developers like Evoware, an Indonesian seaweed bioplastics firm, and Circlepac, a Malaysia-based compostable packaging manufacturer.Repurposing and recycling solutions providers such as Magorium, a Singapore green construction firm, and Upp, a Vietnam-based plastics upcycler.Most of these firms are also relatively young, with 77.1% of them having been founded after 2015. The drop in the number of new plastic waste startups in 2020 could partly be explained by shifting priorities amid the Covid-19 pandemic.Plastic waste is “one of the most present and urgent environmental problems in Southeast Asia,” says Simon Baldwin, global head of circularity for impact accelerator SecondMuse and Singapore-based impact initiative The Incubation Network.But if that’s the case, why did the surge of plastic waste startups only happen after 2015? That’s likely due to two factors: China’s 2017 waste import ban – which shifted the bulk of plastic dumping to Southeast Asia – and growing consumer awareness of sustainability in recent years.While Turkey became the major recipient of European plastic waste, the bulk of the world’s plastic trash headed toward landfills and other disposal facilities in Malaysia and Vietnam.Is the plastic wave too big to tame?Even as Southeast Asia’s plastic waste players gain momentum, there are still several hurdles for them to clear.Past studies have shown that while consumers would like to buy sustainable products, they don’t necessarily want to pay a premium for them.Another obstacle these startups face is the lack of funding. Although Southeast Asian plastic waste startups have seen US$229.6 billion in funding to date, 99% of it went to RWDC Industries.But Baldwin says that’s about to change.“Sustainability is becoming more of a priority area for investors, with the circular economy often of particular interest,” he highlights.Rob Kaplan, an impact-focused investor and CEO of Circulate Capital agrees, noting that there has been a tenfold increase in private market funds going toward a circular economy over the last four years.Having invested in seven companies with its US$112 million Circulate Capital Ocean Fund to date, Circulate Capital is part of a growing movement.Another VC fund entering the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) scene is Wavemaker Partners. In October this year, the firm launched Wavemaker Impact, a climate tech venture builder that aims to reduce 10% of global carbon emissions.Still, both these firms concede that more investment is needed for the region’s plastic waste management space to take off.That space remains poorly defined but things may change soon as an increasingly diverse crowd of players step up to the issue and connect with each other.In countries like Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand, international partnerships and government policies are paving the way to local circular economies.While each country in the region faces unique challenges, similar steps can be taken to mitigate them. That bodes well for future regional cooperation, which in turn can bring Southeast Asia’s plastics ecosystem closer together. According to the World Bank, these steps include:Increasing the sorting efficiency of waste plasticsSetting recycling targetsMandating standards for plastics to be recyclable, especially those used in packagingIncreasing recycling capacitiesImplementing industry-specific requirements to raise waste collection ratesLimiting plastic waste disposal in landfills and eliminating non-essential plastic itemsDepending on their business models, plastic waste startups may not see profits even years into operation. While collecting in-demand plastics to create recycled packaging can generate immediate revenue, solutions like advanced recycling processes and high-tech bioplastics require more research and funding support.Case in point: RWDC Industries, a Singapore-based advanced materials developer, has raised over US$263 million, which indicates that players in the space need hefty funding.See also: Does this US$133M bet on biodegradable ‘plastic’ hold water?Are these solutions enough to stem the tide?However, even as innovators create new, more sustainable forms of plastic, tons of non-biodegradable plastic waste are still lying across Southeast Asia’s supermarkets, landfills, and the ocean.Much of the corporate world appears to be stuck in the old ways too. Global plastic production is expected to quadruple by 2050, and today just 14% of plastic packaging is recycled worldwide.But there is still cause for optimism.For one, the 5Rs of waste management – refuse, reduce, reuse, repurpose, and recycle – offer somewhat of an outline for solving the problem. It also suggests that these startups can make an impact at different stages of the plastic-waste life cycle.","Plastic waste startups are on the rise, but more needs to be done in order to scale their impact.",530158,Tay Tian Wen,True,"Terence lee, Arpit Nayak",0,"['Premium Content', 'Visual Stories']","['plastic', 'plastic alternatives', 'plastic waste', 'Southeast Asia', 'the incubation network']",False,,True,True,True,False,4

It then scoops them up and develops them into a global brand with retail and marketing assistance.Photo credit: B2LinkB2Link prefers brands that have an active presence in Korea but are not as well known outside the country. It is looking to acquire two to five companies every year.“A small brand may be successful in scaling within Korea, but it is difficult to find the right partners and operate globally in a larger market,” Lee said.Founded in 2014, B2Link has built a network of over 500 resellers globally, including those in Shopee, Lazada, and Amazon. Picky’s market data on product revenues and country-wise spending, among others, will help B2Link scale smaller Korean beauty firms more effectively and with significant cost savings.For example, Skin1004, B2Link’s flagship brand, is expected to wrap up 2021 with a more than 3x growth in revenue to US$25 million, along with US$4 million in profit.Meanwhile, Picky’s registered user base has grown 10x over the past year to 250,000 potential consumers for B2Link.Currently, B2Link’s largest markets are Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia, while Picky’s products are most popular in Singapore, Malaysia, and the Philippines.Eliminating the stigma around male beautyOne focus for the company is to bring Korea’s enthusiasm for male beauty to these markets, and beyond. “When you think of beauty and skincare, you usually associate it with women,” said Lee. “But in Korea, we are heavily pressurized into a skincare routine for men and women alike.”Photo credit: VT CosmeticsIn fact, South Korean men spent US$683 million on skincare in 2018, accounting for nearly a fifth of the global total. They were the biggest spenders per head, shelling out about 10 times more than their US or French peers.“There is a big difference between skincare and beauty, and it doesn’t always come through,” Lee added.However, the origin of South Korea’s male beauty obsession may be more complex.

Get the newsletter in your inbox everyday with a Premium subscription.Hello reader,The new year is firmly within sight but the Covid-19 pandemic continues to have a seismic impact on our lives. Not only has it caused devastation across the world but it has also drastically changed the way we socialize, interact, and work. We pay through QR codes, work using either Zoom, Slack, or Google Meet (choose your poison wisely), and interact from a safe distance, wearing face masks.Three years ago, no one would have believed masks would become a fashion accessory or the scale of the digital transformation societies have undergone to keep the global economy ticking. However, some might argue that the pandemic merely accelerated trends that were already taking root. Nonetheless, it’s somewhat assuring that we can count on human ingenuity to prepare and adapt to our ever-changing surroundings.It’s that very ingenuity that gave birth to RedMart – one of Singapore’s first online supermarkets – over a decade ago. Despite a few hiccups in recent years, RedMart appears to now be making the most of the windfall in sales brought on by the pandemic. Online grocery is having a moment in Southeast Asia and RedMart is yearning for the spotlight.Today we look at,How RedMart revived its revenue during the pandemicSeeds Capital backing a Singapore-based smart mobility startupOther newsy highlights such as India’s youngest unicorn buying a denim brand and China’s crypto traders keeping the faith even though exchanges sever tiesAlso, if you are an entrepreneur looking for funding, fill in this form to get your company featured on our list of fundraising startups.Premium summaryRed-hot revivalImage credit: Timmy LoenSince Lazada acquired RedMart in late 2016, not everything has gone to plan. Despite being integrated into Lazada’s app in Singapore in 2019, RedMart’s revenue stagnated, growing by only 1.4% in the financial year ended (FYE) 2020. The Singapore-based company, which celebrated its 10-year anniversary in October, is yet to turn a profit.However, the pandemic’s marked influence on consumers’ buying behavior has provided a lifeline to RedMart, with its impressive FYE March 2021 results paving the path toward stronger growth and, possibly, profitability.Instant impact: RedMart got an immediate boost from the pandemic in June 2020, when it reported that its sales climbed 4x after the city-state introduced strict circuit-breaker restrictions in early April 2020.Back to basics: RedMart’s approach is relatively asset light. It has only one fulfillment center in Singapore, which makes it easier to maintain and manage its inventory. Its improved figures in FYE 2021 were mainly due to a 50% rise in retail revenue from the sale of groceries through its online platforms.A clear picture: RedMart’s net loss in the most recent financial year narrowed by over 4x to US$21.5 million – its smallest on record. This means the company is as close to breakeven as it has ever been.Read more: RedMart’s revenue revives after year of stagnationStartup spotlightWhat’s the rush?Photo credit: RushOwlThe latest entrant into the ride-sharing industry has pinned its hopes on a rather neglected vehicle in this space, i.e., buses. RushOwl is clearly not the only one banking on buses to establish itself in the market. The Singapore-based mobility startup raised US$650,000 in a seed round that was oversubscribed 3x and led by Silicon Solutions Partners, alongside Seeds Capital, the investment arm of Enterprise Singapore.Generating a buzz: RushOwl works with stakeholders in smart cities to provide solutions for mobility, offering on-demand and region-to-region routes. The company said its ridership has grown 400% since 2019 as people sought more options for transportation amid the pandemic.Dipping into SEA: RushOwl plans to use the new funds to expand its ride-sharing product, RushTrail, across the Asia Pacific next year, including Singapore and mass markets such as Vietnam and India. RushTrail uses AI to automatically facilitate rides by pooling commuter requests.Building the blocks: RushOwl is looking to add new mobility products and partner with electric vehicle firms to beef up its ecosystem. It also offers a service for companies that need flexible commute plans for employees.Quick bytes1️⃣ Roll up the sleevesMensa Brands, an Indian ecommerce roll-up company, acquired High Star – a homegrown denim brand that caters to digital-first consumers – for an undisclosed sum. High Star offers a variety of jeans, jackets, skirts, jeggings, palazzos, and shorts, among other products. The firm has also expanded the range of its menswear, womenswear, and kidswear segments.2️⃣ Technically, a pioneerA driverless delivery vehicle named “Pioneer” has started alpha testing for application scenarios at ZTO Express’ headquarters in China. This self-driving vehicle is the country’s first automotive-grade driverless delivery vehicle capable of operating on motor vehicle lanes. Not too surprising? After all, we live in an age where delivery bots might be just around the corner3️⃣ A kerfuffle on the horizon?Indonesia is overhauling state companies and replacing their management teams with professionals and many of the president’s allies, stirring concern that the appointments may be politically motivated. Erick Thohir, the archipelago’s state-owned enterprises minister, has replaced the management at nearly a dozen major state companies since taking office in October 2019. The news comes after Jokowi launched a VC fund backed by state-owned enterprises4️⃣ Keep the faithChinese cryptocurrency investors say they are continuing to trade their virtual coins on overseas platforms as big exchanges end yuan support. Huobi and Binance said they would disable transactions in the Chinese yuan by the end of December. Also, Beijing said this year that overseas platforms serving mainland users were illegal after the country conducted a widespread crackdown on bitcoin mining.5️⃣ Major funding, minor stakeReliance Retail Ventures Ltd, the retail unit of India’s Reliance Industries Ltd, is likely to acquire a minority stake in warehouse robotics company Addverb Technologies for around US$40 million.

Others equate it to an 18th birthday, marking the moment a young company is launched into the harsh realities of public validation.Photo credit: 123rf.comSoutheast Asia’s startups are witnessing these milestones after the region saw a bumper year of stock listings, fueled by an influx of new retail investors and optimism for the region’s economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic.Investors in the region poured over US$4.9 billion into IPOs within the first half of 2021, hunting for higher returns in public markets.Sea Group, parent firm of ecommerce giant Shopee, was the earliest to list in the region, raising US$884 million in its initial public offering in 2017.This year, Grab enjoyed the limelight among Southeast Asian firms. The Singapore-based company, which kicked off as a ride-hailing app, officially listed on the Nasdaq in December and now operates across 465 cities in eight countries, offering food deliveries, payments, as well as insurance and investment products.Grab co-founders ring the opening bell in Singapore as Grab goes public on the Nasdaq / Photo credit: GrabSeveral big-ticket companies including Traveloka and GoTo Group (formed from the merger of Indonesia’s Gojek and Tokopedia) are also expected to list in the coming year.Up north, Beijing’s tight scrutiny on its tech firms – on issues ranging from data security to a loophole long used by companies to list overseas – could also make listings of Southeast Asian firms a haven for investors looking to expand their portfolio in Asia.The subdued Chinese tech landscape could help make the region’s IPO pipeline more geographically diverse, as India and Southeast Asia maintain a busy issuance calendar.On the flip side, the blockbuster domestic listing of Indonesian ecommerce major Bukalapak, which saw a jump in share price that triggered the Indonesian stock exchange’s automatic rejection mechanism, has prompted other startups in the country like Blibli and Run System to abandon plans for overseas share offerings in favor of going local.Here’s a list of some of Southeast Asia’s biggest tech listings in 2021:2021 marked the entry of regional household names, including Coupang, Grab, Bukalapak, Zomato, and Paytm, into the realm of public markets. South Korean ecommerce firm Coupang raised US$4.5 billion in the biggest IPO by an Asian company debuting in the US since Alibaba in 2014.In March, four of the big tech firms in Asia including Coupang, MTAR Technologies, Nazara Technologies, and EaseMyTrip took their companies public.November was also a busy month for several Indian companies this year including Nykaa, Paytm, and Policybazaar, which scheduled their listings before the end of the year. Society Pass, a Vietnam-based tech firm incorporated in the US, also went public in the same month.Paytm, which held India’s biggest ever IPO, opened at a discounted price of 9% in its stock market debut, casting a shadow over the prospect of other tech firms in the country that planned to go public.Similarly, Society Pass, whose shares listed at a premium of 240%, has lost nearly 90% of its stock value over the past month.On the brighter side, Coupang, Nykaa, MTAR Technologies, and Nazara Technologies made stellar stock market debuts in 2021.In 2019, Nick Nash, the managing partner of Asia Partners, predicted that 10 companies worth upward of a billion dollars would go public in the next 10 years in Southeast Asia.

726537,2021-12-29T05:00:57,2021-12-28T02:05:31,Why Traveloka may have been wise to give up SPAC route,traveloka-wise-give-spac-route,post,"When the SPAC market was ultra hot, Indonesia’s Traveloka was among several notable firms in the region that planned to ride the wave.In April, the country’s leading travel unicorn was in advanced talks with Bridgetown Holdings, a special purpose acquisition company backed by billionaire investors Richard Li and Peter Thiel, to go public. By merging with Bridgetown, Traveloka could boost its valuation to US$5 billion.But just a few months later, Traveloka hit the brakes on its SPAC plan. The company, however, says that it remains committed to its IPO goal and is pondering different options.Going public is “a natural evolution” for Traveloka, given its “position as a category leader and aspirations to grow the business further,” says Reza Amirul Juniarshah, the company’s head of corporate communications. He adds that Traveloka continues to be “well-capitalized” while it assesses its options.Photo credit: TravelokaPerhaps it’s still early to say that interest in SPACs has subsided. Notably, super app Grab did a US listing via this route, and more are considering doing the same.It’s clear, though, that the hype has abated from the heights it reached in early 2021. And for Traveloka, following the conventional IPO route might be a good thing, after all.“I think taking the SPAC route to the market is a flawed way to bring your company to the public market,” says Angus Mackintosh, an equity analyst at CrossASEAN Research. “It is basically a shortcut to the market without going through the normal IPO process, which [would require you] to disclose much more and be much more open.”Market changes, downsidesSPACs or blank-check firms are not new, points out Joel Shen, head of tech at the law firm Withers. These entities were popular in the early to mid-2000s for the same reason they are popular now: They offer an easy, cheaper, faster way to the public markets.But then investors lost money, and SPACs fell out of favor for about a decade, Shen adds.To be sure, there are certain differences between then and now. Most importantly, the latest SPAC sponsors – the likes of Li and Thiel – are considered “better quality” compared to those from the mid-aughts.But the reasons behind the dip in enthusiasm are similar. “Investors think that valuations are high, or they are not convinced by the quality of target businesses,” explains Shen.A more pivotal reason, however, was when the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reclassified SPAC warrants as liabilities earlier this year. (In the SPAC market, investors usually receive both common stock and warrants that allow them to buy the shares in the future.)“This altered the fundamental economics of a SPAC,” observes Shen. Instead of making a one-time equity valuation, SPACs would need to account for warrants as debt every quarter – a process costly enough to make SPACs less attractive.SEC building / Photo credit: Kristina Blokhin, AdobeIn addition to a less-friendly regulatory climate, SPAC investors also have the right to pull their funding at any time should they feel bearish about the target company.Indeed, more of them have been doing just that in recent months. In the third quarter, 52.4% of investors redeemed their funds, up from 21.9% in Q2 and 10% in Q1, according to Dealogic.One example is the digital media company BuzzFeed, which merged with blank-check firm 890 Fifth Avenue Partners. After investors in its SPAC partner withdrew their investments, BuzzFeed was left with just US$16 million – a paltry 6% of the original US$288 million.Given the trend, it was natural for Traveloka to reconsider its options.“We saw the situation, and we made a decision based on that context,” says Willson Cuaca, co-founder and managing partner of Traveloka backer East Ventures. “If Traveloka forcibly went through the SPAC, it might not get any investment at all.”The Dealogic data is consistent with analysis by The Edge Consulting Group, which found that SPACs provide stronger returns in the pre-combination period – i.e., before they merge with a proper business and formally list, which is typically within two years.Case in point: Grab’s share price was US$17 per share before the listing, but it is now around US$7. That said, Grab’s SPAC partner, Altimeter Growth Corp., is subject to a three-year lock-up period, and the redemption rate was effectively 0%.On the other hand, its private investment in public equity (PIPE) investors – including Mubadala, Temasek, and Djarum – are not subject to the lock-up period. But PIPE investors can only begin to trade after the SEC approves the F-1 registration statement, which will take at least a month after the listing.Grab co-founders ring the opening bell in Singapore as Grab goes public on the Nasdaq / Photo credit: GrabInvestors make these pre-combination investments based on the SPAC’s management and the anticipation of making a good acquisition. There is minimal examination of the company’s financials, says Alexander Korda, The Edge’s global deals analyst.“The management is really only responsible for making an acquisition before that two-year period expires,” he elaborates. “They are not necessarily incentivized to bring a good company to market.”With SPACs eager to make a “quick buck,” the structure of the deals tends to benefit the management more than it does the end shareholders, Korda says.This is echoed by CrossASEAN Research’s Mackintosh, who says that the SPAC route is “a slightly more speculative instrument” than a traditional IPO.The fact that Grab plunged 21% after its Altimeter deal shows the characteristics of SPAC investors, he argues.“SPAC investors are not people who are necessarily investing in Grab. They don’t know what the SPAC is going to buy. So they’re investing in the SPAC owners and their ability to execute on a merger,” Mackintosh says.Internal circumstancesThere are also concerns about momentum, considering Traveloka’s focus on travel. Although the Indonesian government has started to ease movement restrictions, travel activities are still lower than pre-pandemic levels.Concerns over the resurgence of Covid-19 also persist. Indonesia recently detected its first omicron case, which has ignited calls to bolster health protocols. Not only does the new variant appear to spread rapidly, but it also seems to be no less severe than delta and can even evade vaccine protection.“Because Traveloka complements the tourism industry, it will remain difficult until 2022, especially considering that the pandemic has not shifted to an endemic,” says Dianta Sebayang of State University of Jakarta. He serves as the head of the innovation center and business incubator at the university.Shen of Withers, however, argues that just becoming part of the SPAC conversation is already a feat for Traveloka, which majorly focuses on the travel industry. In contrast, its peers like Grab and GoTo are diversified tech companies.“I think many people overlook the fact that to even get to this point was an incredible achievement for Traveloka,” Shen says. “Ask yourself how many travel-related businesses have shut down as a result of the pandemic.”Traveloka Xperience CEO Christian Suwarna (second from left) at the launch event / Photo credit: TravelokaTo Traveloka’s credit, it has been expanding its business even before the pandemic. The company started offering a buy now, pay later (BNPL) service in 2018 and took it further this year by allowing customers to use the BNPL service outside its network. Traveloka has also dipped its toes into food delivery, skills training, and medical services.See also: How Traveloka expanded beyond travel (Visual)“Out of all the Indonesian unicorns, you would have expected Traveloka to fail the worst, but it was actually one of the first to enter into these discussions about an exit,” Shen says.Mackintosh points out that Traveloka’s “reasonably good track record” is exactly why it does not need to enter the public markets so quickly. “Taking the SPAC route in some ways would smack of desperation, and they don’t need to be desperate,” he says.Where to go from here?As Shen puts it, getting an exit is like getting married: It makes far more sense to partner with the right person than to rush into marriage with the wrong one.In a statement to Tech in Asia, Traveloka says it remains committed to going public, hinting that a conventional channel is still possible.Nevertheless, Shen believes Traveloka will still pursue a US listing “principally because that’s where the deepest pools of capital are in the world.” In addition, “the valuation will probably be richer” in that market since “US – at least Nasdaq investors – understand tech businesses,” he adds.Moreover, the SPAC market is not necessarily as easy as it looks, Mackintosh says. Grab, for example, initially planned to list in July, but it took the company until December to execute the plan.“Grab has proven that the SPAC route is not a rapid route to market,” particularly since large companies like the regional super app have “many moving parts,” he says. “The SEC has made them effectively come back with a much more detailed set of numbers.”See also: Grab’s pit stops along the road to its IPOThe Edge’s Korda also contends that amid a global crisis, the SPAC market seems to be particularly risky compared to a traditional IPO.“IPOs are a listing mechanism that the market is used to, and SPACs are still relatively new. So the jittery nature of the pandemic market may have simply been the wrong time for SPACs to emerge as a new strategy,” he argues.Will Traveloka’s decision deter other companies from pursuing IPOs via SPACs, though? Shen doesn’t think so.“It doesn’t change the fact that Grab, GoTo, and all of these regional tech businesses have all raised institutional capital,” he says. “And when you raise institutional capital, you are on a runway to exit.”","The company remains committed to going public, and given the waning enthusiasm for SPACs, a traditional listing might be the best path to take.",559337,Budi Sutrisno,True,"Putra Muskita, Eileen C.

The company saw its revenue rise by nearly 50% to US$307 million in the financial year ended (FYE) March 2021.RedMart’s new 350,000 square feet West Fulfillment Center in Singapore / Photo credit: LazadaThe Singapore-based company, which just celebrated its 10-year anniversary in October, witnessed an immediate effect of the pandemic on its sales. In June 2020, RedMart reported that its sales grew 4x after the city-state introduced strict circuit-breaker restrictions in early April 2020. Just a year before, the firm was stagnating – its revenue for FYE 2020 grew by only 1.4%.“In the last 18 months, the pandemic had led a dramatic shift in online purchasing behavior, and more households have turned toward RedMart for their weekly grocery needs,” Richard Ruddy, chief retail officer and head of grocery at Lazada Singapore, told Tech in Asia in an interview in September.According to Ruddy, the company had been integrating into the Lazada app in Singapore since the start of 2019. As a result, parts of RedMart’s business have also shifted under Lazada, and these movements were not reflected in just one set of financials.Lazada acquired RedMart in late 2016.A rebound in revenuesFor RedMart, the rise in its numbers is a return to the high growth levels it achieved years earlier (in FYE 2019, the company posted a 44% jump in its revenues).See also: RedMart saw 3x income growth and better margins since Lazada buyoutAt the beginning of 2021, Tech in Asia reported that RedMart’s pure-play model appeared to make more sense amid the pandemic rather than the traditional brick-and-mortar model of other players. RedMart’s approach is relatively more asset-light. It has only one fulfillment center in Singapore, which makes it easier for the company to maintain and manage its inventory.Workers at RedMart’s West Fulfillment Center / Image credit: LazadaIts improved figures in FYE 2021 was mainly due to a 50% rise in its retail revenue from the sale of groceries through its online platforms – its mobile app and website. In the previous financial year, these numbers stood at US$191 million, which was roughly the same as a year before. As retail revenue continues to be the largest driver for the company – contributing to over 90% of total revenues over the years – this was a huge factor to its sluggish growth in FYE 2020.Meanwhile, its marketplace revenue – which consists of commissions it received from acting as a third-party agent on the sale of goods – declined marginally by 9% in the latest financial year. Its “other revenues,” which include earnings from services like marketing, grew significantly by over 45%, though this segment is RedMart’s smallest source of revenue.However, the company’s total expenses in FYE 2021 rose by nearly 40% to US$388.6 million, mainly driven by a 45% rise in its cost of sales.In order to rein in its expenses, RedMart cut employee compensation by 86% and general and administrative expenses by more than 2x.“After the integration of both RedMart and Lazada began in 2019, certain cost considerations, such as manpower and technology, were streamlined and placed under the Lazada umbrella,” said Ruddy.Back on the profitability pathIn Tech in Asia’s earlier story on RedMart, we pointed out that profitability was an ongoing concern for the online grocery firm. The company’s operating loss grew larger with every financial year starting from FYE 2017. In FYE 2019, its operating loss widened by 25%.The company has since made strides in reducing its operating loss over the last three financial years. In FYE 2021, its operating loss dropped by 113% to US$32.6 million. A year earlier it declined by 24%.It’s operating loss margin has significantly improved as well, coming in at -10.6% in FYE 2021 from -42% two years earlier.While RedMart’s gross profit margin has grown incrementally over the last three years, its net loss margin has seen a large improvement in FYE 2021, down to -7% from -42% in FYE 2020.The company also posted its lowest net loss in the most recent financial period, with a dip of over 4x to US$21.5 million. This puts RedMart the closest it has ever been to breakeven.The large improvement in net loss was partly due to the online grocery firm registering a non-operating income – in the form of finance income – amounting to US$11.2 million in FYE 2021. This figure consists of foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to its borrowings. Compare this to the past two financial years, when the company incurred finance costs instead. (It should be noted that this figure is the only difference between the company’s operating loss and net loss financials.)While Covid-19 definitely gave RedMart a much needed boost, will it be enough to help the company deliver net profits soon?Currency converted from Singapore dollars to US dollars: US$1 = S$1.36RedMart’s full financial statement below:","The Covid-19 pandemic gave RedMart a boost in FYE 2021, but will it be enough to help the company bring in net profits?",449210,Collin Furtado,True,Jaclyn Tiu,2,"['Ecommerce', 'News', 'Premium Content']","['Covid-19', 'e-grocery', 'earnings', 'grocery delivery', 'Lazada', 'online groceries', 'Redmart', 'Singapore']",False,,True,True,True,False,4

In turn, investors take higher chances by injecting bigger amounts of cash, as it is considered less risky than their early-stage counterparts.Late-stage funding, which refers to series C and subsequent rounds, can be traced back to as early as 2012 in Indonesia. That year, Tokopedia received an undisclosed amount of series C funding from two Japanese VC firms, namely Beenos Partners (formerly known as Netprice Partners) and SBI Investment.Over the years, dozens of tech firms in the country have closed late-stage rounds. That said, it’s not common to reach this part of the fundraising journey, as prominent companies like produce marketplace Sayurbox and agritech firm TaniHub are still in their series B rounds.Those who make it to series C, however, have not always received the same amount of attention.

Get the newsletter in your inbox everyday with a Premium subscription.Hi readers,It was perfect timing to scrutinize Grab’s internal structure just before the company made its stock market debut. The public responded really well to our first org chart – some of them may be curious about how Grab arranges its resources.However, company structures tell a bigger story. They define the firm’s priorities and how decisions are made within a chain of command. Many companies sell this short, and their structures just grow organically without much planning.As we are confronting a crisis like no other, company structures can give a firm’s leadership an easier time to determine which channels it should keep and which ones could be cut short – without disturbing the organization’s overall flow. While remote work is drawn out, clear company structures will lead to better performance monitoring and, for some firms, hybrid designs.That said, we will expand this type of visual on our platform and examine the organizational structures of other leading companies in the region.

726266,2021-12-23T06:00:42,2021-12-23T10:29:22,What’s behind the growth of fintech in South Korea?,whats-growth-fintech-south-korea,post,"Bring up South Korea, and the first thing that comes to mind is its cultural exports. K-pop sensations like Grammy-winning group BTS and K-dramas such as the Netflix hit Squid Game series are a global phenomenon.There’s also its consumer electronics brands. Samsung and LG, for example, are household names in many markets. But South Korea’s tech scene goes much deeper than that: For one, the country’s fintech sector is booming. Kakao Pay, the fintech arm of messaging app Kakao, is valued at about US$10 billion, while Seoul-based startup Toss raised almost US$400 million in June as part of its plans to grow its sales by 12x. The company is eyeing an initial public offering in 2025.It turns out that this growth in the fintech space could be traced back to the consumer tech industry.Chayee Song, manager of Seoul Fintech Lab / Photo credit: Seoul Fintech LabAs consumers increasingly used smartphones, their behavior changed and became “centered on mobile,” says Song Chayee, manager of Seoul Fintech Lab, an institution that hosts incubation and acceleration programs for fintech startups. “This has opened the door to the development of customized financial services for consumers.”Success factorsOne of the major reasons for this growth has been the support of the South Korean government. After recognizing the sector as an important engine for job creation and economic development, the Financial Services Commission introduced an initiative called the Financial Regulatory Sandbox in April 2019. This allows fintech-related startups to test new services with more freedom.“If a startup’s apps or services are designated as an innovative financial service through this initiative, it can be temporarily exempted from needing to adhere to regulations, allowing it to quickly test and commercialize its ideas,” Song says.She adds that the government expects banks to play a more innovative and productive role beyond their existing duties, and they’ve stepped up to the plate. For Tanker, a firm that offers real estate finance solutions, its relationship with the Industrial Bank of Korea (IBK) began with the bank’s 1st Lab, a sandbox program specifically designed to facilitate hands-on application of new technologies. In Tanker’s case, it was an AI-driven automated loan review system.Tanker CEO Lim Hyunseo / Photo credit: Tanker“IBK’s main interest was in process automation for various banking solutions,” observes Tanker CEO Lim Hyunseo. “Under IBK’s sandbox program, we were able to prove the market viability of Blitz, our flagship B2B solution that reviews and evaluates real estate properties with greater accuracy and speed.”The partnership also laid the foundation for Doczip, Tanker’s consumer software service that automates tedious real estate paperwork processes to create personalized and accurate real estate documents with real-time data verification.Essentially, working with IBK allowed Tanker to flesh out and commercialize its solutions, which is similar to what Metsakuur, a facial recognition AI software startup, experienced with its partnership with Hana Bank.MetsaKuur chief financial officer Lee Seoho / Photo credit: MetsaKuur“Hana Bank recently launched its updated mobile banking app, and its authentication service is enabled by our facial recognition technology,” explains Lee Seoho, chief financial officer of Metsakuur. “This technology has proven to be a key factor in the success of the app’s bio-authentication methods, and this success has helped position us as a leader in the field. We’ve now also extended our services to IBK and Shinhan Bank.”Hana Bank also invested in Metsakuur’s pre-series A round. Taken as a whole, the collaboration has served as a catalyst for business expansion, and the startup is now gradually expanding its clientele to government ministries and public institutions as well as the construction and education fields.Accelerating growthSong points out that banks also benefit from these partnerships by giving them access to new customers with growth potential. Accelerator and incubator programs such as Seoul Fintech Lab play an important connector role, too.“In creating collaborative links with existing financial companies – including overseas ones – we provide the networks for startups to expand into,” Song says. This network effect is strengthened further by how the accelerator offers its startups office space in Yeoui-do, a core financial hub in Seoul.“It’s an area with many potential clients, and we’ve also had the opportunity to share experiences with other tenants and receive patent and legal advice,” says Lee.Seoul Fintech Lab also provides a variety of mentoring programs that cover various aspects of startup management, including marketing, business launch support, and employee training. Lim mentions that for Tanker’s staff onboarding, it relies on the organization instead of implementing the process itself.Apart from its networking offerings, Seoul Fintech Lab hosts demo days and investor relations events. These activities provide startups with the opportunities to look for funding – always a “major concern” for founders, as Lee puts it.What’s next?As with most industries, the Covid-19 pandemic has sped up the growth of the South Korean fintech ecosystem. Song thinks that the change will continue to accelerate, and sectors such as digital banking, digital loans, stock-trading platforms, and payments will rapidly develop.Security is a related industry that will also have to keep up with the fintech vertical’s growth, and big data will continue to play an important role in this respect.For its part, Seoul Fintech Lab aims to keep supporting fintech startups by serving as “a communication channel between financial authorities and companies,” says Song.“It is important to deliver policies and systems to the market so they can take root. Conversely, market opinions must also be reflected in the policies,” she concludes.Funded by the Seoul Metropolitan Government, Seoul Fintech Lab provides customized support for the various needs of fintech startups and offers office space for up to three years.Find out more about partnering opportunities on its website.This content was produced by Tech in Asia Studios, which connects brands with Asia’s tech community.

In turn, these two holding firms are held by SPPIN Limited, which is registered in the Cayman Islands, said CAIT in its statement.Photo credit: Shopee“This complex structuring of entities is nothing but an attempt to hoodwink the Indian government and infuse Chinese funds into India,” stressed Khandelwal.CAIT also claims that Shopee is controlled and operated by Tencent and Forrest Li,the Chinese-born chairman and group CEO of Sea.“Shopee is a Singaporean company committed to helping Indian small businesses thrive through our online ecommerce marketplace,” the company said in a statement to Tech in Asia. “We aim to [be a] partner in India’s digital economy mission while contributing to the Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan.”Tencent currently holds a 20% minority stake in Sea – Shopee’s parent firm – and is a investor in top Indian companies such as Flipkart, Byju’s, Swiggy, Udaan, and Ola.Amid rising border tensions with China last year, India had banned over 200 Chinese apps including TikTok, Shein, PUBG, WeChat, and Alipay. The government barred the apps “for engaging in activities which are prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state, and public order.”See also: Indonesia’s ecommerce race gets brutalAccording to a MoneyControl report, Shopee is clocking nearly 100,000 orders per day in India and selling products at rates as low as 9 rupees (US$0.01).

In 2020, the company felt the heat from rivals in Indonesia for alleged anti-competitive practices. However, no action was taken against Shopee after it clarified its approach.In Malaysia, consumer groups asked the Competition Commission to investigate Shopee for allegedly offering 3,000 ringgit (over US$700) in vouchers to sellers to shut down their stores on Lazada.See also: Shopee’s rivals cry foul over its aggressive tactics to win sellersShopee is also facing scrutiny in Southeast Asia.

But the past one and a half years have also led to contractions in the labor market, with many businesses either decreasing employee salaries or exercising layoffs.These staff cuts, however, have provided an opportunity for Sampingan, an Indonesian workforce management platform. Wisnu Nugrahadi, Sampingan’s CEO and a Gojek alum, reveals that the company now has over 1 million job seekers on its platform – a 3x increase compared to pre-pandemic times.The Sampingan team / Source: SampinganMore importantly, its revenues have grown 10x between 2019 to 2021.“Honestly, from a marketing perspective, we didn’t spend much effort to increase the number of workers,” Nugrahadi tells Tech in Asia. “Perhaps the name Sampingan itself is already well-known by job seekers.”As App Annie data shows, Sampingan’s downloads were sluggish at the end of 2019 but then rose rapidly in mid-2020. That was enough to attract US$5 million in series A funding earlier this year, which brought the company’s total investment to US$7.1 million.Digitizing the old waysSampingan – which translates to “side job” – was founded in 2018 by Nugrahadi, Dimas Pramudya Putra, and Margana Mohamad. It initially aimed to help companies find pre-vetted workers (primarily blue-collar workers) on demand, but it has since expanded to offer other services, including an end-to-end SaaS platform for enterprise and brand management.Nugrahadi and Putra are both Gojek alumni – Nugrahadi was an operations manager, while Putra was the decacorn’s head of product growth. The initial idea for Sampingan came from a problem that Nugrahadi encountered when he was with the super app: The company had a worker management system that was run completely manually.Sampingan also differs from freelance marketplaces like Fiverr and Upwork in a few ways. First, it is a closed enterprise platform. A client needs to sign up through Sampingan’s sales team – and do so with an official company representative – instead of just going through the usual online sign-up process.The platform itself is also enterprise-focused. Customers can carry out processes like recruitment, employee tracking and management, as well as payroll administration, all on Sampingan.“What we do at Sampingan is actually simplifying the [recruitment and worker management] process by automating most of it,” says Nugrahadi.(From left) Sampingan founders Wisnu Nugrahadi, Dimas Pramudya Putra, and Margana Mohamad / Source: SampinganBut perhaps a larger distinction between Sampingan and other services is its blue-collar focus. Where Fiverr and Upwork concentrate on white-collar tasks (like data entry and graphic design), Sampingan’s pool includes warehouse workers, couriers, field marketing representatives, and the like. While the company started by focusing on part-time or freelance workers, it has now expanded into full-time positions as well.There’s high demand for such workers from Sampingan’s clients, which include big names like logistics firms Paxel and Shopee Xpress, as well as the likes of Bukalapak and e-wallet LinkAja. In turn, there is also no shortage of supply, especially due to the pandemic. As of April 2020, a total of 70 million Indonesians work in the informal sector, a segment that has been directly affected by Covid-19.Of course, there are existing companies that serve this need, but they tend to be either SaaS startups – that provide just a system – or traditional workforce companies that supply workers without the tech.“At Sampingan, we provide both because we see the two as one package that can’t work without the other,” Nugrahadi explains. “What really differentiates us is that we are fully end-to-end.”10x revenue growthSampingan’s holistic approach appears to resonate with clients. Revenue has grown 10x in two years, Nugrahadi says, though he declined to reveal exact figures.The company generates income from businesses that use its platform for things like recruitment, management, and payroll services. A company spokesperson says it charges custom rates depending on each client.So far, more than 150 companies use its platform, and Nugrahadi says the startup targets big enterprises with more than 150 employees.The CEO ascribes much of Sampingan’s revenue growth to companies being more open to trying digital recruitment and management processes.For decades, businesses operated on traditional face-to-face methods, “but during the pandemic, there were many limitations,” he explains.(From left) Wisnu Nugrahadi, Antler CEO Magnus Grimeland, and Margana Mohamad / Source: AntlerThe hope is that these companies will see time and cost savings and that the solutions will stick.“Workers can take up a whole day in public transport just for interviews and screening, and if we think about that, it’s one whole day when they could’ve spent it earning money,” Nugrahadi says. “There’s a cost there, and not just from the company’s side, but also the jobseeker’s. That’s what we want to solve.”Not surprisingly, growth amid the pandemic has also attracted investor attention.“As a series A-focused VC, we invest based on growth potential, and the key areas we look for are team, market size, and product-market fit. On all three fronts, supporting Sampingan was a compelling and clear decision for us,” says Gavin Teo, general partner at Altara Ventures, which led Sampingan’s series A round. Other participating firms in the round include Golden Gate Ventures, Access Ventures, and Antler.A nascent spaceSampingan is not the only startup in Indonesia tackling the workforce sector. Other names that provide similar end-to-end platforms include Workmate (backed by Grab Ventures, Atlas Ventures) , MyRobin Indonesia (backed by Bamboo Sea Ventures), AdaKerja (backed by Beenext), and Job2Go (backed by Bansea).Workmate, previously known as Helpster, is a Singapore-based company that expanded to Indonesia in 2017. Similar to Sampingan, it lets customers automate recruitment, onboarding, and scheduling, as well as track time and attendance and conduct performance analytics processes. MyRobin, AdaKerja, and Job2Go also have more or less similar features.However, the space is ultimately still nascent. Out of these companies, Workmate has raised the largest amount of funding so far, with US$20.6 million. The others have altogether raised a total of less than US$10 million in disclosed funding, with Sampingan making up the bulk.But Altara Ventures’ Teo says the segment has huge potential, highlighting that half of Indonesia’s 250 million population is currently eligible for blue-collar and freelance jobs.“As a young startup, the biggest challenge for Sampingan is where to focus scarce time and attention to stay in the game,” Teo explains. “Indonesia is rapidly developing, and with that comes ever-increasing expectations from workers and employers to do more, faster.”While Sampingan is not yet profitable, Nugrahadi says that the company aims to get there by automating more of its internal processes, an area where it will focus much of the spending from its freshly raised funds. The firm is also targeting clients in other industries – its management platform is currently available for logistics firms, advertising agencies, and companies in the online-to-offline sector.The startup will also add new features like insurance benefits, earned wage access loans (i.e., salary advances), as well as professional networking for blue-collar workers. Indonesia will also remain its main market.“These offerings further deepen the network and drive value and retention beyond job placement, which we expect to be a game changer for Indonesian workers, their employers who use Sampingan, and the Indonesian blue-collar economy,” adds Teo.",Sampingan lets clients like Bukalapak and Shopee Xpress automate recruitment processes and worker management with an end-to-end system.,558171,Jofie Yordan,True,Putra Muskita and Jaclyn Tiu ,0,"['Premium Content', 'Profiles']","['altara ventures', 'Antler', 'Indonesia', 'Sampingan', 'startups', 'workforce']",False,,True,True,True,False,6

These are just some of the many grocery store items that consumers need to have within 1o minutes.Zepto is one of the players in a growing crowd of quick commerce apps that have become beneficiaries of a lockdown-fueled funding bonanza.Photo credit: ZeptoFounded earlier this year by Aadit PalichaandKaivalya Vohra – both dropouts from Stanford University – Zepto aims to deliver groceries in 10 minutes through a network of stores.The company has raised US$100 million in its series C financing round led by Y Combinator’s Continuity Fund, along with participation from Glade Brook, Nexus, Breyer Capital, Lachy Groom, Global Founders Capital, and Contrary Capital, among others.The latest investment, which comes 45 days after Zepto’s previous fundraise, lifts the company’s valuation to US$570 million, CEO Palicha told Tech in Asia.Zepto’s new capital will be used to expand its coverage across multiple cities in India and to ramp up hiring across functions including operations, supply chain, marketing, finance, product, engineering, and human resources.“Delivering groceries in 10 minutes is a game changing experience for customers and it reflects in our strong product-market fit metrics,” said Vohra, who serves as the company’s CTO. “This data has given us the confidence to expand the 10-minute model across the country.”Zepto said it has been tripling its user base every month. Its month-on-month buyer retention stands at 65%, with an 88-point net promoter score, a customer loyalty and satisfaction metric.Within five months of the company’s launch, it has set up 100 microwarehouses – each of which has the capacity to deliver over 2,500 orders per day. Zepto also plans to launch microwarehouses at a faster rate in the coming months.A quick pivotZepto initially kicked off with a slower delivery model, ensuring orders reached customers in about an hour.

This establishment of a micromarket helps delivery executives focus on specific areas, provides them with a stable flow of orders, and improves their delivery timing.Currently, the company has about 30 to 40 dark stores in every city in its coverage area, and it is hiring hundreds of delivery executives each day as part of its expansion plans.

We break down the big and messy topics of Asia’s tech and startup community. Get the newsletter in your inbox everyday with a Premium subscription.Hello reader,Timing is everything, not only in business, but also in life, love, career, and finance. Yet, the stars very rarely align for things to perfectly fall in place. Hence, the birth of AI, machine learning, data science, and any tool or field of study that can help us crack the code of the magic crystal ball. The best we’ve currently got is bite-sized insights of the future, based on predictive behavioral patterns.While a number of tech firms in Southeast Asia are either making their debut on public markets or well on their way toward an IPO, Vietnam’s startups are nowhere to be found. As you may have already guessed, timing has a thing or two to do with it. The country’s startup ecosystem is at a nascent stage compared to those in some of its Southeast Asian neighbors.Therefore, the dash toward the IPO goldmine for Southeast Asia’s startups just came a bit too early for Vietnam. It’s not a case of playing catch up for Vietnam’s startups – rather, it’s a case of arriving late.Today we look at,Why no VN startup showed up to SEA’s IPO partyThe startup known as the “Bloomberg for digital assets”Other newsy highlights such as lucrative funding for Singaporean and Indian startups as well as Byju’s closing in on US listingPremium summaryThere’s no need to hurryImage credit: Timmy LoenThis may shock you, but an IPO is not always the endgame for startups. No one is rushing to cash a smaller check (I know, so 2000s, right?). The time may not be ripe for Vietnam’s IPO hopefuls to jump into the stock market, but their founders are unlikely to be losing any sleep over it.Vietnam’s startups are bursting with potential and are privately well funded, with the total deal value in the country skyrocketing to US$1.3 billion in the first half of this year.More ways than one: In a report titled “SEA Exit Landscape 2.0,” Golden Gate Ventures, which has focused on Vietnam since the mid-2010s, forecasted a total of 468 exits between 2020 and 2022 for the whole region. About 80% of these exits will be driven by mergers and acquisitions, 15% by secondary sales, and only about 5% by IPOs.Not blessed with abundance: Vietnam doesn’t have a lot of high-value tech startups for now, with the list only consisting of three unicorns – VNG, VNLife, and Sky Mavis – and two soonicorns in Tiki and MoMo. Among these tech stars, Sky Mavis – developer of the globally popular blockchain game Axie Infinity – is an exception. The startup is technically considered a Vietnamese unicorn, though it is not incorporated in the country.A loophole: Regulations are a big factor in the race to go public, even for major corporations. For example, foreign shareholders are barred from owning more than 50% of a company in certain sectors in Vietnam. The listed entity must be approved by the State Securities Commission (SSC), even for an offshore listing. The SSC requirement, however, can be circumvented if a non-Vietnamese entity is listed.Read more: Why Vietnam is missing out on SEA’s IPO partyStartup spotlightBloomberg, is that you?The Nansen team/ Photo credit: NansenA classic case of mistaken identity. Nansen, which has been called the “Bloomberg for digital assets” by investors, recently picked up US$75 million in a series B financing round. Scams have been rife in the crypto world and this Singapore-based startup caters to the growing need for analysis and research into cryptocurrencies as investors look to secure their digital assets in a highly volatile market.One for all: Nansen is used by both retail and institutional investors, counting the likes of Three Arrows Capital, DeFiance Capital, Genesis Block Ventures, Not3Lau Capital, Polychain, YBS Capital, and Acheron Trading as its clients. The platform is also used by Polygon, Lido, and Sky Mavis.More than a collectible: The blockchain analytics firm anticipates an explosion of various use cases for non-fungible tokens (NFTs), going beyond just being collectibles. Large companies and brands may offer discounts to NFT owners, which could lead to a change in their advertising models. Case in point: Nike recently entered the metaverse with its purchase of RTFKT, an NFT collectibles and fashion startupNot just for the money: Nansen expects its backers such as Accel, GIC, Andreessen Horowitz, Tiger Global, and SCB 10X to help it improve its annual recurring revenue using their experience in dealing with startups in Southeast Asia. This will also allow the firm to reach institutional players who can have access to chain data.In partnership withData collection at your fingertipsI once had to coach a large group of students. While the actual coaching was fun, the admin work was not – collecting the phone numbers of almost 100 people was mind-numbing.But that’s nothing compared to the scale of admin work involved in enterprise data collection.

Who are the key decision-makers? How are the teams organized? What does it tell us about the company’s priorities? We kick off this new series with Southeast Asian super app Grab.The Grab story started in 2012 with its two co-founders, Harvard graduates Anthony Tan and Hooi Ling Tan, and their goal of creating a safer way to book taxis in their home country of Malaysia.By 2020, it became a decacorn with around 7,000 employeesspread across eight Southeast Asian markets. Its business has expanded from transportation to include logistics, digital payments, and financial services.Grab CEO Anthony Tan / Photo credit: GrabWhile Grab’s management team has expanded over the years, some things have stayed the same. For one, both Tans continue to helm the company. Joining them at the top is group president Ming Maa, who came on board in 2016 following stints at Goldman Sachs and SoftBank Group.See also: Uncovering Southeast Asia’s hidden Grab and Gojek mafiaWhat’s apparent from Grab’s organizational chart is the importance it places on its largest market. All country heads report to Russell Cohen – the group managing director of operations and head of mobility – except for Indonesia’s.Neneng Goenadi, the country managing director for Grab Indonesia, reports directly to the top level. She oversees three executives in charge of a specific region in the market: west Indonesia, east Indonesia, and Jabodetabek (the Greater Jakarta area).Aside from having a country lead, Indonesia is also the only Grab market that has its own president. Ridzki Kramadibrata, Goenadi’s predecessor, fills that role.This isn’t a surprise considering Grab’s outsized presence in Indonesia and its close relationship with the country’s government.Here are a few more observations:Cheryl Goh was offered the job before the app existed, and she continues to lead marketing today.Theo Vassilakis, an alum of Google, Facebook, and Microsoft, served as Grab’s group chief technology officer until June 2019. It’s unclear whether his role has since been filled.Linda Hoglund left Klarna – a buy now, pay later company based in Sweden – to become Grab’s first chief financial officer in 2016. She stepped down after a year and was replaced by Peter Oey.Two executives, Demi Yu and Michael Truong, came from Uber after the US-based firm’s Southeast Asian business was acquired by Grab in 2018. They currently serve as Grab’s head of deliveries and head of product, respectively.Reuben Lai started leading Grab’s digibank in late 2021 after previously being in charge of the company’s financial services vertical, which is now managed by Kell Jay Lim.See also: Grab shares may drop further as more stocks flood the marketThis article is sort of a prototype for us, and we hope to expand on this org chart and do similar pieces on other companies if people find it useful.You can also check out our coverage of Grab here.

Many fresh graduates have decided to eschew traditional nine-to-fives in favor of setting up their own tech companies, focusing on a variety of areas such as education and web security.However, while virtual solutions of all sorts have popped up, there remain problems that need to be solved. Sustainability issues continue to plague Asia Pacific, for example, with the region performing poorly in the environmental targets of the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Additionally, while borders are slowly beginning to open up, there’s still a lot of uncertainty over the future of the hospitality and tourism industries.Problems like these are what these fresh graduates turned tech entrepreneurs are aiming to solve, and it’s more important than ever to help them bring their tech solutions to fruition.“No market for these ideas”It’s clear that the need to innovate remains crucial, but fresh ideas alone won’t make a huge impact.According to Leo Jiang, Huawei’s chief digital officer for Asia Pacific, the pandemic may have accelerated adoption of existing technologies, but the missing key ingredient is the talent needed to build the next step.“With the pandemic, things changed so fast that the talent growth couldn’t keep up,” he says.Leo Jiang, Huawei’s chief digital officer for Asia Pacific / Photo credit: HuaweiThe talent crunch is a well-established problem in tech circles. Some research suggests that by 2030, there will be a shortage of 47 million tech talents in Asia Pacific alone. So where will the tech professionals of the future come from?An obvious answer would be the latest crop of students and young graduates. However, while many of them have grown up surrounded by tech, the ability to transform ideas into actual solutions is much harder without access to practical experience, opportunities, and connections.Jiang shares that he faced similar issues 20 years ago when he was in his final year of university. It was crucial to find a company that could sponsor students like him for projects, “but it was so difficult to find even a single company that could give us a project to work on,” he says.As a result, most students ended up building something on their own. For Jiang, it was a data capture software, but it wasn’t the most informed of processes. As a student, he says his innovations were stymied by a lack of opportunities to develop his skills on a practical level.“I didn’t have any commercialization opportunities, because there was no market for these ideas,” he recounts. “At the time, I just thought The Matrix was pretty hot, and I thought of hackers as great role models. That’s why I did it.”A lot has changed since Jiang’s time as a student, but there are new challenges for today’s innovators to overcome, such as selecting the right technology for their projects and figuring out how to access the resources needed for them.“I think that’s the first thing that young developers need to understand: which platform, which technology do I need to put my hands on?” Jiang says. “And once you do, then it’s about the cost of learning, the cost of commercializing that learning into a prototype.”Hacking for greatnessUnderstanding the need to support students and their ambitions to become tech entrepreneurs, Huawei will make a US$100 million investment to cultivate 10,000 developers, the company announced at its 2021 Spark Founders Summit.To make that vision a reality, the Chinese tech giant will host its inaugural Huawei Cloud Spark Hackathon Singapore in early 2022 to open up opportunities for students, aspiring entrepreneurs, and technology enthusiasts to gain experience and training. Through the program, participants will be invited to plan and build an original product on Huawei Cloud’s proprietary cloud computing platform. These solutions must be based on a number of categories, including sustainability, travel, education, and healthtech.Teams will then pitch their prototypes to a panel of judges for the chance to win a US$15,000 cash prize and potential job opportunities within Huawei and its portfolio companies.Photo credit: kzenon / 123RFJiang explains that the idea behind Huawei’s hackathon was to not just give young tech talents a chance at winning some cash or scoring a job, but also to connect them directly to players in the tech industry. To that end, startup founders from Huawei’s portfolio companies will also attend the hackathon.“Students will be coached by the industry leaders who have not only the technical background, but also commercialization experience,” Jiang says. “These are real-world startup founders and technical experts who can provide the training and know-how to guide you in the right direction.”Hackathon with a differenceHuawei’s event sets itself apart because of two core components: the underlying technology, and the emphasis on education.Participants of the Huawei Cloud Spark hackathon will build their prototypes on the Huawei Cloud platform with integrated features like the next generation GaussDB distributed database software, which offers no risk of data loss. Huawei will also give participants access to solutions that are already being used in the market, like Australian startup Pi Exchange’s AI/ML tool. With this, the event provides young talents the opportunity to play around and learn with otherwise inaccessible enterprise-grade software.The hackathon also emphasizes the education aspect. All event participants have the opportunity to be trained on Huawei’s cloud service via the Huawei Certified ICT Associate (HCIA) program, which can be accessed as either a self-paced learning module or a five-day course led by an instructor.Through the HCIA educational framework, Jiang says participants can also pursue certification that can improve their future career prospects.First stop: SingaporeFor Huawei, the hackathon represents something more than just a fun competition with a lucrative cash prize – it’s also about the resources needed for future innovations.“Cloud and AI are the most fundamental ingredients to build the digital future,” Jiang predicts. “I don’t think there’s anyone starting a company from scratch in the traditional way anymore, so these are essential tools and knowledge.”However, the hackathon is just one step in the long journey toward developing a robust cloud and technology ecosystem. Jiang describes a multi-pronged strategy where Huawei will continue investing in new product and service offerings to better serve startups, and it will also roll out more initiatives to develop talent.The first iteration of the Huawei Cloud Spark Hackathon is set to take place in Singapore in mid-January 2022, and is focused on giving HCIA certifications to at least 500 students. In the future, Huawei plans to hold hackathons in other countries like Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, and the Philippines.“We definitely want to train and educate as many students as we can, and help them find a job in order to contribute to the social and economic side of things in Singapore,” Jiang says. “Imagine if 20 years ago, someone said their hackathon would not only connect you with the industry, but educate you while also providing tools and training. Wouldn’t that be amazing for a student?”Huawei Cloud Spark Hackathon Singapore is currently open for applications until Jan 16, 2022. Students, technology enthusiasts, and aspiring entrepreneurs with fresh ideas for products in sustainability, finance, banking, education, hospitality, travel, and healthcare are welcome to sign up.Find out more about the hackathon and apply to participate on the competition’s website.This content was produced by Tech in Asia Studios, which connects brands with Asia’s tech community.

Get the newsletter in your inbox everyday with a Premium subscription.Hi readers,I’m not a sports fan, but I’ve dabbled in startups long enough to know that business is a team sport. And as with any team sport, not every player is going to stay when management changes hands.Some may depart because of a conflict of beliefs and egos. Others, whose contracts are about to expire, have more practical reasons to up and leave. Many in the Lazada mafia would likely resonate with these reasons.Although members of the company’s alumni network were behind several high-profile startups as early as 2012, the scale of the group truly skyrocketed after Alibaba’s acquisition of Lazada in 2016.Several characteristics distinguish the Lazada mafia from others. For one, the companies in the network are very young. Our analysis found that 73% of Lazada alumni startups were founded after the Alibaba acquisition. Most of them are also in the pre-series and series A stages.Second, the group is striking out on its own path. Unlike the Alibaba mafia which rode the same waves as the Chinese tech giant, most Lazada alumni startups are venturing into industries that Lazada does not have a presence in.These proteges may no longer play for team Lazada, but that doesn’t mean they’ve shaken off all ties with the ecommerce major. Some, like Una Brands and Branded Group, are leveling the ecommerce playing field for Lazada-affiliated merchants, and others may help realize the ecommerce firm’s bigger aspirations yet.— Tay Tian Wen, journalist at Tech in AsiaTop stories this weekImage credit: Timmy Loen1️.

I’ll be moving into my new house, so even as the year is ending, it’s also a time of new beginnings for me.(Side note: You never know how much crap you own till you have to haul all of it halfway across the country.)I suppose you could say that I’m undergoing a kind of exit, leaving my parents’ house and care to settle into a brand new world (of chores and bills).And hey, what do you know: today’s premium article takes a quick look at the 20 largest exits for Indian companies.

This reflects an absence of labor protections in the wider informal economy and the platform economy in the country.Photo credit: FairworkWhile Grab, Gojek, and Paxel offer accident insurance, emergency helplines, and access to health insurance for their workers, such initiatives were not taken up by Anteraja, Ninja Xpress, and Maxim.“Workers still face a lot of issues regarding working conditions,” the report said. “For example, long working hours are one factor behind the ‘success’ of most gig workers, representing a classic trade-off between income generation and quality of life.”See also: Ninja Van CEO talks profitability, deals with Grab, and pitfalls of the gig economyZoom in on GrabIn what Fairwork describes as “generally poor performance” by ride-hailing firms in Indonesia, Grab came out ahead of some of the other companies with a score of five out of 10 points (Gojek’s GoCar and GoRide offerings also had the same score).Photo credit: ShutterstockGrab has offered a handful of measures to its workers over the years. More than the accident insurance and emergency helpline, it also provides access to discounted goods and services such as health insurance and healthcare, an extensive training program, and Covid-19-related sick pay.The Fairwork ratings also took into account other aspects such as fair management. On this, Grab earns some points, as its contracts specifically discuss a zero-tolerance policy on sexual harassment, with a definition of what constitutes as an act of sexual harassment and the legal consequences of any violations.See also: Should gig platforms fear Singapore PM’s remarks?While Grab has acknowledged the challenging environment of labor relations and representation in Indonesia, the platform has yet to find a way to enable the independent and collective expression of worker voice or to engage in processes of collective bargaining and representation, the report said.A legal loopholeGig workers in Indonesia also face another challenge: They often aren’t considered employees due to a legal loophole in the country’s labor law.In Indonesia, the agreement between an employer and the worker must have at least three elements: work, command, and wages.Photo credit: Tech in AsiaHowever, ride-hailing firms claim they aren’t giving any direct command to these gig workers, as the demand is said to come from customers through the app.As a result, the absence of an employment relationship has excluded gig workers in Indonesia from receiving the worker rights and protections offered by labor law. This includes the rights to a minimum wage, overtime pay, and social security (e.g., medical, retirement, and unemployment benefits).See also: Lewd advances, unwanted touches: SEA women founders, execs speak outThis lack of protection also makes gig workers more vulnerable to employment termination.In a formal employment relationship, companies have an obligation to give severance pay and other benefits in the event of termination. But in the gig economy, which is said to operate on a “partnership relationship,” companies may easily suspend their workers temporarily or remove them permanently from the platform via algorithm-based decisions.Correction (Dec. 21, 6:00 p.m. SGT): The article earlier incorrectly stated that the report said Grab had not acknowledged the challenging environment of labor relations and representation in Indonesia.","Other ride-hailing firms in the country including Maxim, Anteraja, Ninja Xpress, and Paxel lie below the halfway mark of Fairwork’s maximum score of 10.",470877,Deepti Sri,True,Collin Furtado and Jaclyn Tiu,0,"['Landscape reports', 'News', 'Startups', 'Transportation']","['AnterAja', 'fair pay', 'Fairwork Foundation', 'gig workers', 'Gojek', 'Grab', 'Indonesia', 'maxim', 'Ninja Express', 'Paxel']",False,,True,False,True,False,4

He’s become a core part of the firm’s leadership team, helping the company to  list on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) in August this year. The listing made Bukalapak the first unicorn to go public on the archipelago’s home board and was the largest recorded for the bourse.Oetomo’s journey to this point, which involved moving from a traditional finance background to the startup sphere, has been one of learning and unlearning.From economics to ecommerceOetomo started his career as a research analyst in Australia. At the same time, he was pursuing his doctorate degree in economics and teaching at the University of Sydney.“I always knew I wanted to be an equity analyst and felt that the work involved with writing a thesis would help a lot with the foundations for that,” he says.After graduating, Oetomo landed a job at global financial services firm Credit Suisse. He was based in the Indonesia office and worked at the firm for eight years, climbing up the ranks to become the director of equity research. In 2014, he took a year off from his finance career, opting to help out with his family’s business, before joining asset management company Schroders as its head of intermediary business in 2015.Having achieved his initial dream of being an analyst, Oetomo was open to a change in pace. That was when Bukalapak came knocking on his door.“One of the Bukalapak shareholders is someone who I’ve known for over 15 years, and he approached me with this opportunity,” shares Oetomo. “Since I’d spent my whole life in the capital markets and asset management space, it enticed me to try my hand at something a little different.”What was also interesting was Bukalapak’s mission of empowering micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) in Indonesia and its drive to create significant social impact while fueling its own growth as a company.“Bukalapak is an example of doing good by doing well,” says the executive. “It’s not often that you get to do both at the same time.”A different cultureWhen Oetomo joined Bukalapak, the scope of his work was not too different to what he was doing before, but he was not prepared for the culture shock of going from a multinational corporation (MNC) to a fast-moving tech startup.The Indonesian offices of such MNCs typically had 50 people, and all of them came from similar backgrounds, says Oetomo. “When I joined Bukalapak, there were thousands of employees across so many different fields – sales, marketing, programming – it was a very large spread,” he adds.Photo credit: BukalapakAdditionally, the “move fast” approach that Bukalapak adopted with its working processes took him by surprise. In an MNC, there were “rules around everything, including buying a client a cup of coffee,” Oetomo says. At Bukalapak, decisions were often made over calls and chat apps, instead of structured meetings.Joining the startup also challenged a lot of his preconceived notions about what could be done in a company, forcing him to reevaluate a lot of his thought processes and perspectives.“You have to discipline yourself to be open-minded but logical,” he says. “Where I came from, we lived with a predetermined set of rules and have a predetermined perspective of what is doable. When someone comes up with an out-of-the-box idea, we often shut it down without really thinking about it.”Joining Bukalapak forced him to think logically about new ideas and opportunities in order to understand if something really was impossible or if he just wasn’t thinking about it in the right way. This applies to every aspect of the business, whether it’s developing new products or hiring to fill particular roles in the company.“When you’re in a tech startup, you’re going where no one has gone before,” shares Oetomo. “You need people to ask ‘why not?’ And that gets innovation going.”Milestones on the journeyIn the three years he’s spent at Bukalapak, Oetomo has been part of many milestones on the company’s journey, most notably the firm’s listing on the IDX.As an analyst, he spent plenty of time on the other side of the table, reviewing the IPO prospectuses of firms and analyzing them to determine valuations. However, being on the management team of a company looking to go public was a different game.Oetomo and the Bukalapak leadership team at the firm’s virtual Public Expose event in July 2021, where Bukalapak’s IPO plans were announced / Photo credit: Bukalapak“I never appreciated the amount of extra work and pressure you experience being on the management side,” explains Oetomo. “It’s like a house of cards, where you need to make sure everything is in the right place.”This was where his previous work experience came in handy. As Bukalapak geared up for its listing, Oetomo’s knowledge in forming narratives and running road shows made a difference. He helped Bukalapak connect to prospective investors and “sell” its story by bridging the gap between the banking and the management sides of the equation.Taking a company public is a once-in-a-lifetime feat, says Oetomo, adding that “it was a really interesting and rich experience.”Besides the tangible achievements, he is most proud of how the employees under his care – coupled with the opportunities provided by Bukalapak – have grown since joining the company.“When you see how far they’ve come from where they started, how much learning they’ve done, and how they’re now taking on new roles and challenges – that’s quite an achievement.”Making the switchWhile Oetomo’s switch from the corporate world into the startup realm has been a successful one, he’s quick to note that it’s certainly not something for the fainthearted.“It’s rewarding, but there’s a lot of late nights, high intensity, sudden moments where your heart rate starts spiking – it’s hard work, and there’s no free lunch,” he notes.His advice for anyone looking to make the leap is to be aware of what you’re getting yourself into and to be willing to keep an open mind in all situations.“You need to question everything that comes your way because by doing so, we innovate and we do better,” Oetomo shares. The executive believes that this mindset will help when navigating uncharted territory.Indeed, Bukalapak is adopting this approach as it enters its next phase of life as a listed company. In Oetomo’s view, the only way the firm can grow even further is to continue coming up with new solutions beyond what it currently offers.“We need to dare to disrupt ourselves because only by doing so can you go to the next level and really provide the next-level solutions,” Oetomo believes. “As the market evolves, we’ll need to evolve along with it to continue addressing the needs of our customers.”Bukalapak is a leading tech company in Indonesia that serves both online and offline markets, driven by their mission to empower SMEs through innovation and technology to create a fair economy for all.Learn more about Bukalapak on its website.This content was produced by Tech in Asia Studios, which connects brands with Asia’s tech community.

Even though its listing has performed below expectations, Grab’s achievement could still inspire other IPO hopefuls from the region, including those from Vietnam.Photo credit: GrabThe latest Internet Report from Asia Partners suggests that half of the current 39 unicorns in Southeast Asia could go public in the next decade. After Grab and GoTo, startups like Carousell, Carsome, Carro, Ninja Van may be next in line.But when will tech companies from Vietnam join the party?It’s worth noting that in 2014 – when Grab was still a two-year startup called MyTeksi in Malaysia – VNG and Garena were the only two unicorns in Southeast Asia.Their journeys couldn’t have been more different. Garena’s parent firm, Sea Group, has morphed into a New York-listed titan with a market value of US$140 billion. Shopee, Sea Group’s ecommerce arm, is aggressively growing its empire across India, Europe, and Latin America.See also: How Shopee can succeed in Poland, IndiaMeanwhile, VNG’s global efforts are still relatively nascent. Bloomberg recently reported that VNG was looking to raise up to US$300 million ahead of a potential listing in the US. In 2017, the company signed a memorandum of understanding with Nasdaq for an IPO but its much-anticipated overseas stock market debut has not yet come to pass.In response to questions from Tech in Asia, a VNG representative declined to elaborate on its listing plans.Hot but not there yetIn 2020, Tech in Asia reported that compared to Indonesia, Vietnam’s burgeoning ecosystem had fewer startups raising series A money and beyond.Since then, the landscape has changed significantly.In the first half of this year, the total deal value in the country skyrocketed to US$1.3 billion, according to the latest Google-led SEA e-Conomy report.Data tracked by Tech in Asia also shows that the ecosystem has begun maturing, with the amount of money from series B to C rounds and beyond shooting up considerably in 2021.However, only ecommerce major Tiki has declared its intention to tap the overseas public market before 2025.Tiki’s game plan makes sense as its valuation has reached US$850 million following its series E round. Meanwhile, MoMo’s valuation is expected to exceed US$1 billion as the payment app reportedlyhas bagged US$175 million in funding from Japan’s Mizuho Bank.But apart from these two soonicorns and the country’s existing unicorns (VNG, VNLife, Sky Mavis), Vietnam doesn’t have a lot of high-value tech startups for now. A report by Cento Ventures suggests that there are a few Vietnam-based companies valued at over US$100 million, such as edtech firm Topica, Batdongsan (owned by PropertyGuru), or Misa (which produces accounting software).Among these tech stars, Sky Mavis, owner of the globally popular blockchain game Axie Infinity, is an exception. The three-year-old startup, which is technically considered a Vietnamese unicorn, is not incorporated in the country while most of its users are outside Vietnam.Digital land in Axie Infinity / Image credit: Axie InfinityIn general, “we’re still relatively early in the tech cycle in Vietnam,” says Olivier Raussin, managing partner at FEBE Ventures, an early-stage VC fund based in Ho Chi Minh City. “The companies in Vietnam are privately funded very well and there is no urgent need for an IPO right now.”The sentiment is shared by Joel Shen, a partner at law firm Withers who also co-leads its tech team for Asia. He notes that Southeast Asia has come to the end of its first M&amp;A cycle just as the region’s most mature tech companies like Grab and GoTo reach an exit.Therefore, it’s too early for Vietnamese IPO hopefuls to join the public ride. “Vietnam is probably still behind the curve,” says Shen. “Don’t get me wrong – it’s hot now. Vietnam is like Indonesia in 2015 or 2016.”Regulations are a stumbling blockUK law firm Freshfields notes in this briefing that “an offshore IPO of a Vietnamese company with Vietnamese founders and with its roots in Vietnam would represent an exciting new chapter for Vietnamese enterprise.”The firm, which has been operating in the country since 1994, stresses that Vietnamese companies that are listed overseas “were predominantly foreign-owned prior to their listing and/or operate in other markets.” It also noted that “the listed entities are often holding companies incorporated offshore.”A recent example is US-incorporatedSociety Pass, which claims to be the first Vietnamese company to list outside its home market. The firm has lost nearly 90% of its stock value over the past month.This year, Vietnam has seen some corporations announcing plans to list offshore such as VinFast (an auto unit of VinGroup) and The CrownX (a retail platform of Masan Group).Flashback to 2017: Speaking to Bloomberg, Vietjet Air said that it wanted to be the first Vietnamese company to list overseas. That hasn’t happened yet, and with the Covid-19 pandemic, the budget airline’s goal might be a distant dream.Timing aside, regulations are a major factor in the race to go public, even for major corporations. For example, foreign shareholders are barred from owning more than 50% of the company in certain sectors in Vietnam. The listed entity must be approved by the State Securities Commission (SSC) even for an offshore listing.The SSC requirement, however, can be circumvented if a non-Vietnamese entity is listed.Ecommerce major Tiki aims to tap the overseas public market before 2025. / Photo credit: TikiIn May, Tiki established Tiki Global, a Singapore-based holding firm that owns more than 90% of its Vietnam-based business. The move to be incorporated in Singapore mirrors the approach of Grab, which was originally based in Malaysia. But unlike the super app, which has a regional foothold, Tiki only operates in Vietnam and is still headquartered in the country.Even then, the whole process is still “a very involved piece of work,” says Chris Milliken, an M&amp;A and corporate lawyer at Freshfields’ Ho Chi Minh City office. “If the company decides to list a non-Vietnamese holding company, it’s also about how you put the Vietnamese business into that kind of vehicle.”One of the complications is that Vietnamese businesses might be subjected to foreign ownership limitations in certain sectors, Milliken adds.In terms of onshore listing, he explains that it’s nearly impossible at the moment for most tech companies in Vietnam to make a domestic stock market debut. The country’s amended Securities Law 2019 requires companies to be profitable for at least two years and have no accumulated loss at the time of listing, which is a major challenge for most consumer tech companies, even worldwide.VNG was reportedly aiming to raise up to US$300 million ahead of a potential listing in the US. / Photo credit: VNGOver the past 15 years, only three local tech companies have made an onshore stock market debut: FPT Corporation (information technology, listed in 2006), Yeah1 Group (media network, 2018), and Clever Group (advertising, 2020).Is going public everything?“Vietnam is just at the start of its anticipated boom,” says Vinnie Lauria, founding partner at Golden Gate Ventures. “It’s a market investors will not be able to ignore in the next few short years.”Golden Gate Ventures, which aims to raise US$120 million for its fourth fund, has focused on Vietnam since the mid-2010s. In a report titled “SEA Exit Landscape 2.0,” the firm forecasted a total of 468 exits between 2020 and 2022 for the whole region, with about 80% driven by M&amp;A activity, 15% by secondary sales, and only about 5% by IPOs.Photo credit: Golden Gate VenturesGrab’s current tumble on the Nasdaq might be a wake up call for other IPO hopefuls. A public offering should not be treated as a final destination, and it’s definitely not a route that all companies must take, industry experts say.Still, Lauria is optimistic that the current flow of VC funding to Vietnam can set the stage for “a deep cadre of high-potential listings from Vietnamese firms” soon.But what kind of stories could the country’s IPO hopefuls sell to global investors? VNG, Tiki, and MoMo primarily serve the domestic market – a strategy that Asia Partners refers to as being “Vietnam-only.”“I don’t think it’s necessary for you to have an international business in order to go public but you need to have a story,” says Shen of Withers.For example, GoTo – the merged entity of Indonesian startups Gojek and Tokopedia – hasn’t really flourished overseas. Tokopedia is clearly Indonesia-only, and Gojek is not leading in any of its foreign markets, either.See also: Will GoTo’s SEA story entice enough investors?Nevertheless, GoTo has raised US$1.3 billion in its pre-IPO round.Photo credit: GoTo GroupGoTo serves as an inspiration to a generation of Indonesian entrepreneurs, and it receives much support from local regulators. Last week, Indonesia announced the amendment of rules to allow the issuing of multiple voting shares, rolling out the red carpet for GoTo to head to the public market. Malaysia also recently revised its SPAC framework to “facilitate greater access to fundraising” in the country.“If that’s something Vietnam wants to encourage, it will have to think about whether the IPO rules need to be changed,” says Freshfields’ Milliken. “However, the biggest tech companies may still want to look overseas because that’s where the biggest market is.”But the prestige of an offshore listing is not a given. Just look at the amount of negative headlines about Grab’s falling share price. Its current valuation is now around US$26.7 billion, which is a deep cut from its original price tag of nearly US$40 billion.See also: Grab shares may drop further as more stocks flood the marketWhile Vietnamese tech companies have lured big-name investors such as SoftBank, Goldman Sachs, Warburg Pincus, Goodwater Capital, they will face greater scrutiny and the pressure to perform on a quarterly basis if they list.“The risk of being one of the first few is daunting,” says Nam Le, a principal at Touchstone Partners, a Southeast Asia VC fund that focuses on Vietnam.“Many startups which were established years back do not have the easiest structure to list abroad. The next generation of startups might be more open to [an] offshore IPO, but time is needed for scale.”","Many homegrown tech startups dream of listing overseas, but the challenges are immense.",162517,Thu Huong Le,True,Terence Lee and Arpit Nayak,0,"['Analysis', 'Premium Content']","['goto IPO', 'Grab', 'grab ipo', 'Southeast Asia', 'Startup Funding', 'startups', 'tiki', 'Vietnam', 'VNG', 'VNG Corp']",False,,True,True,True,False,8

I’ve spoken to some of the biggest media companies in the world who are actively working on NFTs and have allocated hundreds of millions of dollars to get more active in the blockchain space,” Svanevik said. “They’re trying to figure out how NFTs can be a part of their strategies going forward.”The company also anticipates an explosion of various use cases for NFTs, apart from just being collectibles like we’ve seen this year. Large companies and brands may offer discounts to NFT owners, which could lead to a change in their advertising models.Recently, Nike entered the metaverse with the purchase of RTFKT, an NFT collectibles and fashion startup, whose flagship product is a hybrid NFT and physical shoe collectible inspired by the CryptoPunks NFT collection.SEA at the centre of the metaverseNansen said Southeast Asia has been forward-looking about technological development, with several people potentially leapfrogging the banking sector and going straight into cryptocurrencies.Photo credit: Tech in Asia“This leap forward could be similar to what happened in Vietnam, where people skipped the desktop and went from having no internet connectivity to using mobile apps,” Svanevik said.While several cryptocurrency companies, including KuCoin, CoinGecko, and Zilliqa, are headquartered in Singapore, the gaming scene is strong in Vietnam, where most of Sky Mavis’ team is based.Indonesia, Southeast Asia’s biggest economy, is also emerging as a large mobile-gaming market, with 80% of players in the country using gaming apps once to several times a day.On the other hand, Thailand’s oldest bank, Siam Commercial Bank (SCB), is betting on cryptocurrencies with the acquisition of Bitkub in a deal worth US$536 million. SCB said it will also work with Bitkub to develop new business models for digital assets.","Nansen, a Singapore-based blockchain analytics firm, counts Sky Mavis, Polygon, and Lido among its clients.",470877,Deepti Sri,True,Collin Furtado and Arpit Nayak,0,"['Blockchain', 'Fintech', 'Investments', 'News', 'Startups']","['blockchain', 'blockchain analytics', 'cryptocurrencies', 'ethereum', 'fundraising', 'nansen', 'polygon', 'Singapore', 'Southeast Asia', 'web 3.0']",False,,True,False,True,False,5

We break down the big and messy topics of Asia’s tech and startup community. Get the newsletter in your inbox everyday with a Premium subscription.Hello reader,When I was in school and looking for part-time jobs during the holidays, it was pretty common to see job postings with the phrase “join with your friends” appended to them, especially for places that were looking to hire temporary staff en masse. I’ll admit, it was pretty fun to be working with friends, even if we were just doing boring things like packing goody bags for an event.Much like how I took up jobs along with my buddies, VC firms also invest alongside other investors whose interests align with theirs. There are many reasons why a firm would choose to co-invest with several others – or to not invest with someone at all – but what’s interesting is uncovering the tangled web of these connections, which is what my colleague Tian Wen did.Today we look at,The state of VC alliances in Southeast Asia in 2021A startup that’s trying to make the morning after a night out less painful Other newsy highlights such as what the future could hold for Grab and Cars24’s entry into Southeast Asia  Premium summaryHey buddy!Image credit: Timmy LoenIt’s no secret that VCs invest with peers all the time. What’s interesting, though, is taking a closer look at these connections and exploring the networks that these firms have built. Here’s a look at the state of VC alliances in Southeast Asia in 2021.At the top of the leaderboard: There’s been a significant reshuffling over the past year in the top 20 most active VCs in Southeast Asia in terms of deals made, although the top five most active investors have mostly kept their previous positions.Expanding the circle: According to our analysis, the top five VC firms appear to have become less agnostic over the past year. In this timeframe, VCs have opened their doors to more co-investors and appear to be deepening relationships with new ones.Welcome to the gang: These new co-investors are a varied bunch, ranging from institutional investors to government-linked firms. However, co-investments in Southeast Asia are coming from an increasingly diverse crowd, such as Chinese corporations and VC firms like Kuaishou, ZhenFund, and Boyu Capital, as well as startups-turned-investors like Traveloka and Ovo.Read more: The hidden alliances between SEA’s VCs, uncovered (2021 edition)Startup spotlightCall me when you’re soberPhoto credit: BouncebackHangovers are no fun. The last time I had one, I spent the better part of the day lying in bed feeling very sorry for myself. That’s why some former senior executives at Grab have come together to launch Bounceback, which produces an anti-hangover pill to help folks get back up on their feet after a late night of drinking.All-natural: Launched in September this year, Bounceback’s pill is made of natural substances, with dihydromyricetin (DHM) as its “hero ingredient.” DHM helps metabolize alcohol faster by decreasing blood alcohol concentration and promoting alcohol clearance.Cash in the bank: The firm raised an undisclosed sum in a seed round from investors in September. It’s currently looking to raise another US$3 million in its pre-series A round by January 2022 to get approvals from various health regulators, complete its compliance process, build its inventory, and ramp up hiring.Some lessons from Grab: According to Bounceback co-founder Roy Ang, Grab pushed companies to build communities similar to that of its own. Bounceback has also adopted this approach by distributing its pills at concerts hosted by local disc jockeys, instead of selling them through traditional pharmacies.Quick bytes1️⃣ The journey ahead for GrabGrab‘s first few days on the public market haven’t been the easiest, with its shares ending last week at US$7.12 apiece, which is roughly a 45.5% discount to its opening price on December 2. However, analysts see an easier road ahead for the firm, especially if its mobility segments pick up.2️⃣ Rebel with a causeRebel Foods, an India-based cloud kitchen unicorn, has committed US$150 million in strategic brand investments and acquisitions globally. The amount will be used in the next few quarters to scale up existing and new partnerships with over 40 Indian and international brands. Rebel Foods is currently present in 10 markets, where it operates over 4,000 cloud kitchens.3️⃣ Battle of the used-car marketplaces?India-based used-car marketplace Cars24 is set to compete against Singapore’s Carro and Malaysia’s Carsome as it launches its operations in Indonesia in 2022, marking the start of its expansion into Southeast Asia. Cars24 will invest US$100 million to fuel its expansion plans into newer international markets, after its entry into Australia and the United Arab Emirates earlier this year.4️⃣ Uber charts Didi exitUber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has said that the company is planning to sell its stake in Chinese ride-hailing company Didi. The US-based ride-hailing firm exited China in 2016 after it failed to make a breakthrough in the market and encountered fierce competition from Didi. Eventually, Uber sold its China operations to its local competitor in exchange for a stake.5️⃣ Three-in-one, just like my coffeeThe Hong Kong unit of Singapore-based online classifieds giant Carousell has teamed up with app-based logistics platform GoGoX and buy now, pay later (BNPL) firm Atome to provide services to local businesses via Carousell for Business. Carousell and GoGoX have been working to provide logistics support to sellers through the latter’s GoGoVan and GoGoDelivery services, while Atome helps Carousell’s merchants offer BNPL payment to customers.6️⃣ No FOMO about cryptoSingapore-based payment firm Fomo Pay is joining the DBS Digital Exchange (DDEx) by DBS Bank to enable merchants to accept payments in cryptocurrency from consumers “in a safe and risk-free manner.” Fomo Pay was granted three licences by the Monetary Authority of Singapore for its merchant acquisition, domestic money transfer, and digital payment token services in September.",We uncover the alliances between Southeast Asia’s VC firms and look at a startup that’s making a hangover cure.,242465,Stefanie Yeo,True,Jaclyn Tiu,0,['Newsletters'],"['Atome', 'bounceback', 'Boyu Capital', 'Carousell', 'cars24', 'Didi', 'Didi Chuxing', 'fintech', 'fomo pay', 'fomopay', 'gogox', 'Grab', 'hangover cure', 'hangover pill', 'kuaishou', 'Ovo', 'Rebel Foods', 'southeast asia fintech', 'southeast asia vc landscape', 'Southeast Asia venture capital', 'Traveloka', 'uber', 'VCs', 'zhenfund']",False,,True,False,True,False,5

Delivered every Thursday via email and through the Tech in Asia website, this free newsletter breaks down the biggest stories and trends in ecommerce. If you’re not a subscriber, get access by registering here.Hi there,As tech writers, we are often intrigued by companies that don’t broadcast their every move.Chinese online retailer JD.com has an impressive market value of about US$122 billion. At home, it has weathered the prolonged tech crackdown well, with its US-listed shares rising nearly 10% in the last six months. In comparison, shares of Alibaba and Pinduoduo have fallen about 40% and 50%, respectively, during the same period.Unlike Alibaba, JD.com generally keeps a low profile in Southeast Asia. Its subsidiary in Indonesia, JD.id, has been opening more offline stores in the archipelago even amid the pandemic. In 2018, the Chinese retail giant made an early bet on Vietnamese ecommerce major Tiki, which has become one of the country’s rare soonicorns.JD.com, unlike Shopee and Lazada, adopts a hybrid marketplace and direct retail model powered by an in-house logistics system. Much like its domestic competitors, the company is also looking to get a bigger slice of Southeast Asia’s booming digital economy.Similar to Amazon, JD.com also wants to tackle the higher-quality segment of products. But Amazon hasn’t really cracked Southeast Asia, while Lazada is splurging to keep up with market leader Shopee.Does JD.com have any room left to play in the region? Tech in Asia’s Tianwen attempts to answer this question in this week’s Big Story, which is also our last for this year as we take a two-week break to celebrate the year-end festivities.With the festive season upon us, some of you might be pondering what to wear. Please allow me to add another option: digital fashion. They’re not real clothes but can guarantee that you’ll look fit and cool on social media.Like what we’ve put in this week’s Hot Take, virtual clothes might be able to solve the fashion industry’s long-term waste problem.Cheers,— HuongTHE BIG STORYCan JD.com make a splash in SEA?Image credit: Timmy LoenAs China’s JD.com ramps up its regional push, its first-party logistics play could be a gamechanger.THE HOT TAKECan digital fashion save the planet?Photo credit: amoklv / 123RFHere’s what happened:SoftBank has recently invested US$150 million in Zepeto, a metaverse platform from South Korea that allows users to dress their avatars in high-fashion items.These include pieces from luxury brands such as Gucci, Dior, and Ralph Lauren, as well as items sold exclusively by K-pop group Blackpink. A Zepeto creator has made US$8,500 a month selling virtual clothes.Luxury brands are already jumping on the metaverse bandwagon, making millions of dollars by producing the digital version of clothes that will likely never be worn physically.“You’re going to have a wardrobe of virtual clothes for different occasions, designed by different creators and from different apps and experiences,” said Mark Zuckerberg at the rebrand of Facebook to Meta in October.Here’s our take:The fashion industry’s sustainability problem is deeply ingrained, accounting for 8% to 10% of global carbon emissions and 20% of wastewater. To further illustrate, it takes about 2,700 liters of water to produce one cotton T-shirt.The boom of fast fashion, and more recently ultra-fast fashion brands like Shein, have made things even worse. Tech in Asia previously chronicled the quiet rise of Shein here.The Chinese brand reportedly churns out 30,000 fashion designs each week. The negative environmental impact is enormous if we quantify the number of items produced based on these designs.Photo credit: Wirestock Creators / ShutterstockAnd it’s not just the environment that suffers – exploitation of garment workers is a major issue. Reports about dire working conditions at Shein, H&amp;M, and Zara are common, and these extend to other fast fashion brands.Recommerce, or resale, has been touted as a driving force toward sustainability. But digital fashion can potentially elevate sustainability to the next level.So what exactly is digital fashion? It refers to virtual versions of fashion items – everything from clothing to shoes and accessories. These items can be worn not only by avatars but also by real people – though not physically.DressX, launched in August 2020, is a retail platform for digital clothes that has raised US$3.3 million in venture capital. On the platform, users can buy digital clothing, have that item weaved into their photos, and make a splash on social media.But what’s the point of doing all this? Some users say digital fashion, which can take on designs that aren’t possible in the physical world, allow them to better express their individuality.It could also digitalize the fashion industry by allowing models and influencers to don clothes for photoshoots without needing to wear the actual items physically.DressX even offers a subscription model and works with Crypto.com to release limited-edition designs.Screenshot from DressX’s InstagramFancy some digital couture? Head to Auroboros, a digital fashion house based in the UK that has the tagline “wear the future now.” The firm uses 3D scanning and augmented reality techniques to create its sci-fi designs, which are then applied to photographs of clients (just to note, clients are real people).While the concept of digital fashion might be strange to some people, enthusiasts believe there are some clear benefits: no production, no oversupply, and no stocks, as well as no boundaries on creativity since designers deal with pixels instead of garments. “The fact that you can create something out of nothing really intrigues me,” Stephy Fung, a 3D designer based in London, told Refinery29.It’s fair to assume that the cost to produce virtual fashion would be lower, which can potentially make luxury items more accessible. However, it’s apparently not the case for now. The digital version of a Gucci bag was recently sold for over US$4,000 – exceeding the price of the actual bag.Skeptics are also wondering whether virtual clothes really can save the planet, given the intense electricity usage that comes with crypto mining. That argument, however, is outdated, as blockchain networks are moving to a far less intensive proof-of-stake model of verifying transactions.For this concept to take off, we reckon it’ll need to look surreal (or bizarre)in some cases. Other users would demand natural look, and it is unclear how high the technical hurdle is to meet these expectations. Finally, there’s the issue of how scalable it is, given that each clothing item will need to be stitched into each photo. To what extent can this be automated?It’s perhaps more likely that digital fashion will take off within the fashion industry first before making its way to consumers.— HuongNEWS YOU SHOULD KNOWCheck out Tech in Asia’s coverage of the ecommerce scene here.1️⃣ Grab is buying Malaysia-based grocery chain Jaya Grocer, which operates 40 stores in the country, for an undisclosed amount.2️⃣ Cars24, a used-car marketplace based in India, plans to launch its operations in Indonesia in 2022, competing against Singapore’s Carro and Malaysia’s Carsome.3️⃣ Flipkart is in discussions to lead a US$100 million round in fresh-produce startup Ninjacart.4️⃣ Temasek Holdings is among the global investors joining Vietnam-based retail platform The CrownX’s latest US$350 million fundraise.FYI1️⃣ Sea could be massive in the metaverse if it wants to beImage credit: GarenaSea’s dominance in gaming and ecommerce, its big bet on finance and payments, and its wager on crypto make it a potentially formidable metaverse player.2️⃣ A closer look at the Lazada mafiaLazada alumni have founded hundreds of startups, but it’s questionable how well the ecommerce firm can tap into this network.That’s it for this edition – we hope you liked it!

724720,2021-12-16T04:00:07,2021-12-16T02:34:01,3 startups spearheading AI growth in South Korea,3-startups-spearheading-ai-growth-south-korea,post,"In a world driven by AI, the jobs we know today may no longer exist in a few years. But with this change comes the creation of new jobs, greater convenience, and possibly an answer to the societal problems we wrestle with today.According to McKinsey &amp; Company, at least 70% of businesses worldwide would have adopted at least one type of AI technology by 2030.However, South Korea aims to be one step ahead of the rest.Photo credit: sepavo / 123RFIn line with its national strategy for artificial intelligence, the government is supporting the nation’s thriving AI startup scene to give those with innovative ideas a platform to bring these to fruition.Likewise, the country’s software industry has come together with Naver Cloud, one of the leading cloud solutions providers in the country, to create an ecosystem to drive growth in the sector. Aside from the cloud data analysis platforms it offers, Naver Cloud also provides consulting on AI solutions, enabling companies to leverage new technologies effectively. It’s expanding its services into Southeast Asia, with the goal of bringing its cloud AI solutions to the global market.Thanks to an abundance of innovation opportunities, generous funding, and a competitive landscape, we’ve seen more South Korean businesses prosper. The country’s startups have raised US$870 million in the first half of 2021 alone – an all-time high for its startup scene.Taking a closer look at this space, we’re featuring three South Korean startups powering new innovations in AI.1. FutureMain: predictive maintenance solutions for smart factoriesWith 36 years of experience as a machine diagnosis engineer, Lee Sun-Hwi, the CEO of engineering company FutureMain, has a clear view of the numerous problems that heavy-industry companies grapple with in machine management.Lee Sun-Hwi, CEO of FutureMain / Photo credit: FutureMainOne such issue is a reliance on outsourced talent to fix machine faults, which Lee says has led to fewer in-house experts having the skills to analyze and detect early problems.“Instead of cultivating analyst talent within their own ranks, most chose to use external experts when faults occurred,” Lee explains. “Because of this, basic faults have snowballed into major repair costs and damages for companies – many of which could have been dealt with in house with the right training.”Combining the big data he collected through his own extensive work history with his mechanical engineering expertise, Lee launched FutureMain to build safer and more comfortable industrial sites for workers.The company’s predictive maintenance solution, ExRBM, leverages AI to automatically diagnose early-stage faults, alert operators, and suggest corrective measures. This helps companies address these faults at low cost and removes the need for them to manually analyze machine data each day.Lee knows that the data collected by ExRBM from organizations’ machines is one of the most important resources for their clients. “To allow for the integrated management of multiple factories and facilities in different locations, we decided to migrate to a cloud-based data collection system,” he says.With Naver Cloud’s support, FutureMain upgraded its solution from being purely “on premise” to also having the capability to be used as a software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform that can be accessed via the cloud, depending on the preference of its clients.The cloud firm also provided systematic training support to help FutureMain launch its cloud service and acted as an extension to the engineering company’s operations, helping FutureMain with buyer discovery and its expansion into overseas markets.FutureMain has grown significantly since its early days – it has received over 12 patents, more than eight certifications, and is the only South Korean-made machine management solution to be certified by the government. And the company is only just getting started.“Through research, development, and global market expansion, we hope to attain an even higher level of growth,” shares Lee.2. TentuPlay: bringing personalized experiences to gamersEvery gamer is unique. Put two of them side by side, and you’ll see that both have different playing styles and motivations, even when they play the same game. Despite this, most titles don’t tailor their gaming experiences to the individual needs of their players.That’s where Kwon Hye-yon saw an opportunity for her startup, TentuPlay.Kwon Hye-yon, CEO of TentuPlay / Photo credit: TentuPlay“We wanted to increase user satisfaction in the gaming world and make games generally more fun by creating personalized gaming experiences, so that every user’s needs and wants are satisfied,” she says.TentuPlay uses an AI-powered behavioral economics platform to identify the motivations of users. Depending on these motivations, it can then send recommendations to the player on the best way to level up or even provide different options to play the game. This leads to increased user engagement, retention, revenue, and lifetime value for the game in question.But TentuPlay hasn’t had the easiest of journeys.“One of the biggest issues with being a small B2B startup is that it’s difficult to meet with larger corporate customers,” says Kwon.What changed this was working with Naver Cloud. The cloud fim “helped us connect with various foreign customers despite being a smaller startup,” she recalls.Since then, TentuPlay has been invited to speak at international game conferences and has been nominated as a finalist in the best tool provider category at the PocketGamer Mobile Game Awards 2021.And as the concept of a metaverse gains traction, the company is making big plans for the space.“The metaverse allows users to partake in various activities such as attending concerts, playing games, and shopping. This can lead to users getting trapped in the ‘paradox of choice,’ leading to churn,” says Kwon.By analyzing user behavior data to identify what they enjoy, need, and want, the firm can recommend content, allowing more users to enjoy the metaverse and participate in the space.3. Monitor Corporation: efficient medical image diagnosisAs a graduate of computer vision technology, Lee Kyong-Joon (no relation to FutureMain’s Lee Sun-Hwi), CEO of AI-powered radiology tech company Monitor Corporation, saw a pressing need in the medical industry. Every year, the number of medical images that are taken increases significantly, while the number of radiologists with the skills to read these images remained low. This phenomenon became more evident as Lee traveled to the rural provinces of South Korea and to other developing economies in the region.Lee Kyong-Joon, CEO of Monitor Corporation / Photo credit: Monitor CorporationTo address this talent shortage, Lee launched Monitor Corporation. Its signature product, LuCAS, uses AI algorithms to analyze chest CT scan images and automatically identifies the location and type of disease. These results allow doctors to provide accurate diagnosis for patients more efficiently.While Monitor Corporation is based in Seoul, it has worked with businesses around the globe, including in places as far away as Brazil, using Naver Cloud’s servers.“At the end of last year, a company in Brazil contacted us saying that they wanted to try our service, but we were not ready at the time,” shares Lee. “In the process of preparing for the demo, we encountered many technical challenges. Naver Cloud provided quick responses so that we could successfully open the overseas service demo.”Building solutions on Naver Cloud’s SaaS platform has helped Monitor Corporation establish partnerships with over 20 domestic and foreign organizations – a number that is set to grow.“​​Based on high-quality medical infrastructure, South Korea is applying cutting-edge AI technologies to the medical market most actively in the world,” Lee says. “We aim to bring these high-quality AI services to the global market.”Naver Cloud operates the global IT infrastructure and enterprise solution service for South Korean tech giant Naver and its subsidiaries while providing its public cloud service, Naver Cloud Platform, to a myriad of companies and organizations in diverse industries.Find out how you can scale your business overseas with the power of Naver Cloud by visiting its website.This content was produced by Tech in Asia Studios, which connects brands with Asia’s tech community.

725150,2021-12-16T01:55:50,2021-12-16T01:44:08,Can JD.com make a splash in SEA?,jdcom-splash-sea,post,"Earlier this year, shoppers at Aeon Mall Sentul City in West Java were treated to the grand opening of JD.com’s first overseas E-Space store, which primarily sells electronics and home appliance products.It’s not the Chinese ecommerce major’s first foray into Indonesia, where Tokopedia and Shopee are the dominant players. Local subsidiary JD.id has been up and running since 2015, and it opened five other physical retail outlets in key cities across the archipelago even amid the pandemic.Photo credit: ShutterstockCompared to its rivals like Alibaba and Pinduoduo, JD has fared better in China despite the tech crackdown spearheaded by the country’s regulators. The company also reported US$34.3 billion in revenue for the third quarter of this year, exceeding analyst estimates by a slight margin.For years, JD.com has been perceived as less ambitious than other Chinese firms when it comes to international expansion.But that might be changing. Recently, a top JD executive told CNBC that the firm is looking to ramp up investments abroad. Vietnam and Europe have been singled out as potential expansion locations.JD, which has a market capitalization of about US$122 billion, generally keeps a low profile in Southeast Asia. Soon Sze Meng, its chief for the region, also recently left to join a cloud kitchen startup.Given these circumstances, is JD serious about Southeast Asia? And is there any room for it to play here?A sleeping dragonFor sure, JD’s presence in the region is not as clearly seen as Alibaba’s.Two years after launching JD.id in 2015, the company entered into a joint venture with Thailand’s Central Group and opened brick-and-mortar stores in Indonesia.Beyond expanding its physical footprint, the company also beefed up its online presence by rolling out JD Central in 2018. At the same time, it has invested in regional leaders like Vietnam’s Tiki Corporation and Thailand’s fashion ecommerce Pomelo since 2017.It’s safe to say that JD’s regional thrust has largely been driven by joint ventures and strategic investments into local ecommerce players.Meanwhile, Alibaba – its closest Chinese competitor – has injected about US$4.4 billion into Lazada between 2018 and 2020, with more than US$2 billion in 2020 alone. It’s not clear, though, how much of that money was spent on operations.See also: Alibaba and Tencent’s growing tentacles in Southeast AsiaJD is “not moving fast enough” in Southeast Asia, and that lack of speed is the company’s biggest challenge in the region, says Jeffrey Towson, a professor at Bangkok’s Sasin School of Management. “It’s not building consumer engagement at the same level of its competitors … nor [is it] making big enough capital commitments,” he explains.The firm’s sluggish pace may also be a deliberate choice, explains Towson, who studiesdigital trends in China. It’s likely that JD wouldn’t engage in the spending war between rivals Shopee and Lazada, opting to wait for a more opportune moment to strike, he adds.Josh Gardner, CEO of Beijing-based ecommerce consultancy firm Kung Fu Data, echoes this view. “JD has been waiting until its model is perfect for Southeast Asia,” says the executive, who has been watching China’s ecommerce and retail scene for more than seven years.Unlike Lazada and Shopee’s marketplace commerce model, JD adopts a hybrid marketplace-direct retail model that’s powered by an in-house logistics system.Gardner points out that it would be “strategically very smart” for JD to make bigger bets in the region now. Domestic pressures, which include the Chinese government’s ongoing tech clampdown and slowing online spending in China, means that JD needs to act on its international ambition before it’s too late.China’s current situation is a stark contrast to Southeast Asia, where ecommerce is expected to be the main driver of the region’s US$174 billion gross merchandise value in 2021, according to the latest Google, Temasek, Bain &amp; Company e-Conomy SEA report.JD.com currently holds about 17% of China’s retail ecommerce market, according to estimates by eMarketer. That’s a sharp drop from 24.7% four years earlier, and it’s mostly due to social commerce heavyweights like Pinduoduo – the pioneer in community-group buying – breathing down its neck.Can O2O win the day?Tech in Asia reached out to JD for this story but did not receive a reply.However, Eyvette Tung, head of offline business at JD.id, told TIA that the online-to-offline (O2O) business remains an important component to the company’s Indonesian operations.Physical retail sales have taken a hit due to pandemic lockdowns, but offline channels still comprise nearly 80% of Indonesia’s retail market. Niche ecommerce startups like beauty-focused Sociolla have also found success in adopting a similar strategy.See also: The next phase of SEA ecommerce: niche “super-verticals”By complementing physical retail with a digital platform, JD.id can generate more offline sales and attract more walk-in customers, Tung says. The firm plans to open and develop more O2O outlets in office and residential areas across Indonesia.Image credit: Timmy LoenIn Thailand, JD’s joint venture with local conglomerate Central Group also gives the Chinese firm “online assets” and a “massive retail footprint” across the country, says Sasin’s Towson. The professor adds that this partnership could be a catalyst for JD to rapidly expand its O2O retail in Thailand.On top of its network of offline retail outlets, JD’s logistics expertise also bolsters its O2O strategy.Unlike Alibaba’s hands-off approach to and its logistics arm Cainiao, JD is directly involved with fulfillment and order deliveries. In May, JD Logistics debuted on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.In Indonesia, the firm has distribution centers in every major island, says Leo Haryono, chief marketing officer at JD.id. He adds that the company’s delivery arm J-Express (not to be confused with J&amp;T Express) also offers 24-hour delivery, covering 85% of areas nationwide and 95% of the Jakarta Metropolitan area.Meanwhile, both Shopee and Lazada have just started warming up to the idea of in-house logistics, as shown in this Tech in Asia’s analysis. In particular, Shopee still outsources the bulk of deliveries to third-party logistics providers.Just how effective JD.id’s O2O play is not clear yet. The company placed sixth among Indonesian ecommerce players in terms of average active users, according to App Annie. JD.id also trailed in ninth place in terms of visitor traffic in the first quarter of 2021.There could also be limits to how well JD can tap its strengths in logistics and offline retail. Scaling and replicating its logistics and offline retail footprint could be difficult, given Southeast Asia’s geographical constraints.JD’s advantages are also unwieldy in the early stages of expansion, cautions Towson. “The firm’s edge in quality control, cross-border ecommerce, and logistics are important in the long term,” he says. “But initially, it’s going to be all about consumer adoption and engagement.” And in Southeast Asia, that will require spending and innovating on the customer experience as well as training and onboarding the region’s merchants, who are still mostly offline.Still, JD isn’t without a few tricks up its sleeve. Its dominance in selling computer, communication, and consumer (3C) electronics could be a game-changer for its O2O play.“JD traditionally has been strong in this sector in China,” Towson observes. “If they pull off the same standard in Southeast Asia, they’re going to own that category.”More importantly, JD’s vast supply chain of high-quality Chinese merchants and manufacturers – which regional players can’t easily replicate – could also tip the scales in its favor.Going forwardIt’s likely that JD’s main thrust in Indonesia will be centered on O2O.JD.id’s Haryono says the firm will invest more in its supply chain. It’s also expanding its O2O efforts by developing JD Hubs, which refer to company-owned facilities in the Jakarta Metropolitan Area that offer self-pickup services.How far will that expansion go? Towson suggests that JD likely isn’t looking to wrap its tentacles into every Southeast Asian market. A targeted approach is “probably well-suited to their higher quality positioning,” he notes.It’s unclear as well whether JD will make more bets elsewhere in the region. One option is Vietnam: JD currently holds about 13% of Tiki, which is one of the country’s rare tech “soonicorns.”Still, some factors could derail JD’s renewed offensive in Southeast Asia.For one, its ecommerce competitors pack serious firepower. Sea Group’s Shopee spent US$6.6 billion growing its business between 2018 to 2020, and it boasted a war chest worth nearly US$13 billion in October. Similarly, Alibaba injected US$4.4 billion into Lazada during the same period.JD may also have to deal with super-app contenders like AirAsia and Grab, which also want to carve a niche for themselves in Southeast Asia’s ecommerce and logistics sectors.AirAsia reported that revenue for its delivery unit Teleport has recovered to pre-pandemic levels, and its newly launched air freight service may pose a challenge to JD’s edge in logistics. Grab’s partnership with Ninja Van, which began 2019, also places the Singapore-based super app directly in JD’s crosshairs.As part of its “new retail” strategy, close competitor Alibaba is also venturing deeper into the O2O space. In May, it co-led a US$400 million funding round into The CrownX, the retail subsidiary of Vietnamese conglomerate Masan Group. Alibaba has also led a US$100 million funding round into supermarket chain T11, which operates under a similar model to the Chinese tech titan’s Freshippo.To win, JD could take a leaf from its playbook for China, where the company rose to the top not being the first mover, but by being the most aggressive player instead.A few years ago, JD waged a series of price wars with competitors and traditional retailers in China that saw the firm’s annual sales soar from US$6.6 billion in 2012 to an estimated US$25.2 billion in 2015. Its 2020 net revenue stood at US$34.4 billion.Ultimately, there’s going to be a lot of space for more players in Southeast Asia, says Kung Fu Data’s Gardner. “I’m not sure JD needs to compete with other companies, and it’s likely they’ll still be able to carve a good 20 to 30% of the pie,” he says.","As China’s JD.com ramps up its regional push, its first-party logistics play could be a gamechanger.",530158,Tay Tian Wen,True,"Thu Huong Le, Terence Lee, and Eileen C.

We break down the big and messy topics of Asia’s tech and startup community. Get the newsletter in your inbox everyday with a Premium subscription.Hello reader,My grandmother is a straight-talking woman born in the pre-independent India of the 1930s. She delights in telling me stories of her past – about how she navigated an uncertain political landscape or how she is in awe of all this technological advancement.Her face lights up as she fondly recalls the first time she came across a radio set: It was a gift from her uncle and she remembers how she would sit with her family by the radio set for hours, listening to the news, vibing to music, and laughing over comic skits. How times change, right?By now, you’ve probably realized my grandmother is not really tech-savvy and hardly uses the internet. She still reacts with a child-like chuckle of wonder every time she gets a WhatsApp message. The prospect of explaining the metaverse to her ties my stomach in knots.On that note, today we probe whether Sea Group is ready to dip its toes into the metaverse. Also, if you are an entrepreneur looking for funding, fill in this form to get your company featured on our list of fundraising startups.Today we look at,Sea Group’s prospects in the metaverse worldZoomcar’s aggressive expansion through SEAOther newsy highlights such as Grab settling with ex-staffers in Vietnam and Good Glamm’s acquisition of MissMalini EntertainmentPremium summaryCarpe Diem: Seas the dayImage credit: Timmy LoenIf you look closely, you’ll notice that bits of the metaverse are already around us. As we stand on the cusp of a technological revolution, it is important to realize that the metaverse will not spring to life all of a sudden. For the metaverse to well and truly take off, it’s crucial that companies collaborate with each other. That’s why Tech in Asia took a deep dive at whether Sea Group has the necessary tools to become a key player in this space.Leaving a trail in the dark: Does Sea have any plans for the metaverse? It hasn’t given any indication of this yet. However, the firm’s recent actions provide some food for thought. Sea has already achieved a form of interoperability – a key concept that some say is critical in the metaverse – by ensuring players of its gaming titles, Free Fire and Free Fire Max, can play together seamlessly.Advantage, Sea Group: Sea’s core businesses, Shopee and SeaMoney, are focused on ecommerce and payments, respectively, which are important building blocks of the metaverse. Shopee, which started out selling physical goods, is already branching out in various directions, offering digital vouchers, food delivery, and more. Adding virtual items to the mix wouldn’t be far-fetched.All clues point toward the metaverse: Sea Capital, the company’s investment arm, has made a couple of relevant investments in the crypto assets space. One of them is Forte, which helps gaming publishers incorporate blockchain technology into their games. This allows non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which are crucial to the metaverse, to be minted and sold within games, allowing players to freely trade goods and services with each other.Read more: Sea could be massive in the metaverse if it wants to beStartup spotlightVroom Vroom! Accelerating through SEAPeople standing next to a car rented from Zoomcar / Photo credit: ZoomcarWithin a fortnight of announcing plans to launch in Vietnam, Zoomcar, an India-based car rental startup, is already driving its services into the Philippines. This launch is part of its aggressive expansion plan to capture a sizable chunk of the Southeast Asian markets. Zoomcar will invest US$25 million over the next 12 months to fuel its expansion in the Philippines.Local businesses key to growth: Zoomcar aims to have 1,000 cars available for rent in the Philippines by January 2022. The figure will likely touch 20,000 cars by the end of next year. In order to reach those figures, the company will partner with individual car owners and SMEs with multiple vehicles.Branching out from the capital: Zoomcar will start its Philippine operations in Metro Manila, and it is set to launch in Cebu and Davao next year. The company plans to cover 20 cities in the archipelago by 2023.An IPO to keep in mind: The firm’s aggressive expansion into other countries comes ahead of the company’s plans to go public in the US by around August 2022. Zoomcar is looking to raise a “nine-digit million number” in US dollars from its listing.PodcastDark stores – more widely known as microdistribution hubs – have been gaining prominence in India and Southeast Asia, with grocery delivery startups like Dropezy and Zepto raising millions of dollars in funding and setting up hundreds of centers across the region.The future of this segment is brighter than its name suggests: By 2025, the size of India’s consumables market is projected to hit roughly US$1 trillion, while Southeast Asia’s online grocery market is expected to reach US$11.9 billion – which opens up a prime opportunity for operators of dark stores.In this episode of Deep Dive, Tech in Asia’s Nikita Puri discusses the ins and outs of this rising phenomenon, its key players, and how dark stores can change the way we buy groceries – or anything else for that matter.Listen here: Spotify | Apple PodcastsQuick bytes1️⃣ The dust settlesGrab said it reached a settlement with most ex-staffers in Vietnam following a dispute over their shares in the company.

Here’s what we learned",minted-sold-nft-1100-heres-learned,post,"Our announcement that we were going to sell an NFT artwork generated a bit of buzz, though it wasn’t all positive.One person thought it was “lame AF,” while a couple of others thought it goes against our green ethos (more on this in a bit).Still, we were having too much fun to care.We changed the theme of the artwork at the last minute – after realizing that Grab’s IPO was just around the corner – and then we worked late into the night and over weekends to get everything ready. (Apparently, the “996” work culture is common in the crypto world, I later learned.)Image credit: Timmy LoenAfter the auction launched, I nervously refreshed the page one too many times while on a staycation to see how it was going.10/10 I will do this again.Who wonIn the end, after getting three bids, we sold the piece for US$1,100. And the winner was… anonymous.This person, it seems, used a dormant wallet to buy this artwork and clearly knows his or her way around crypto.We sent out a blast to our mailing list asking the buyer to come forth, but alas, maybe the person had buyer’s remorse already. (We’re still waiting.)Still, congrats to anon for owning a piece of history. We hope you’ve found the purchase worthwhile.Where did the proceeds go?We found out that Ethereum gas fees (essentially transaction fees) took a huge bite out of our proceeds, leaving us with US$731. Still, that’s not too bad. We used all the money to buy carbon credits. We also topped upanother US$7,204.51 to purchase a total of 1,000 carbon credits.This makes us carbon neutral for the year 2022. It also offset the legacy carbon emissions we put into the atmosphere during our founding years in 2011, 2012, and 2013. Thank you Cool Effect for making this possible. You can check out our carbon reduction and offset progress here.What did we learn?Running this experiment certainly got us thinking a lot more about NFTs – what its implications are for the creator economy, what it could mean for Tech in Asia, and so on. We do believe this won’t be the last NFT we’ll create.Finding a new foundationFor this auction, we used Foundation, a sleek NFT marketplace built on top of Ethereum that is suited for edition-of-one digital artworks.What wasn’t sleek about it was the gas fees for minting and listing the NFT, which was surely a deterrent to potential buyers.When we auction our next NFT, we’ll check out other marketplaces that are much more friendly on the wallet – and the earth.Bad for the planet?Bitcoin and Ethereum have been criticized for consuming too much electricity.See also: Why China’s crypto exodus is a boon for green bitcoin miningHowever, we believe that this argument is outdated.First, Ethereum will soon move to a proof-of-stake model, a method of verifying blockchain transactions that doesn’t require intense computations and, therefore, consumes far less power.Second, a number of NFT marketplaces support “layer 2 networks” as well as alternative blockchain networks that are much less energy-intensive.OpenSea, for example, supports Polygon, a layer 2 network built on top of Ethereum. SolSea, meanwhile, is built on Solana, a proof-of-stake Ethereum competitor.We believe minting and selling NFTs on marketplaces like these is the way to go.Tactical lessonsOn the execution side, we picked up a few things, too.We’d definitely want to give ourselves more time in the next go-round to create a stunning piece of work.NFT art pieces are fundamentally different from PFP (profile pic) NFTs. Both are meant to be eye candy, but while PFP NFTs are essentially expensive Twitter profile pictures, NFT art pieces are something you’d want to print and frame up on your wall or display on a large screen.We might also play around with the auction’s timing (weekdays instead of weekends) and its length (is 24 hours the right amount of time?).We’ll also find ways to better remind interested parties about our auction, such as allowing them to set up calendar reminders.All in all, we’re happy we did this. I can’t speak for the others, but I came away from this no less enthusiastic about NFTs (though I think there are way too many Bored Ape Yacht Club copycats around).In my view, NFTs have the potential to:Easily verify ownership and provenance, which prevents art scams like thisImbue utility into ownershipImprove liquidity of the content marketSeamlessly reward content creators with a cut of secondary salesWhile NFTs have been criticized for being worthless because the underlying asset can be easily copy-pasted, that argument was so yesterday.After all, the abundance of forgeries has not stopped an original Kooning or Rothko from fetching millions of dollars in the art market. Owning counterfeits defeats the purpose of owning an art piece: bragging rights.In the meantime, we’re happy to join the ranks of this group of pioneers – modest as our results may be.Want to be the first to know about our next NFT artwork?

Delivered every Wednesday via email and through the Tech in Asia website, this free newsletter breaks down the biggest stories and trends in fintech. If you’re not a subscriber, get access by registering here.Hello there,This is the last issue of The Top Up for 2021, as we’re pausing for our year-end break starting next week.With 2022 around the corner, I’ll be treating myself by purchasing a yoga mat and a skipping rope from Amazon – the items are already sitting in my cart.In all likelihood, I’ll be making the transaction via UPI (unified payments interface), a payment system developed by the National Payments Corporation of India. It’s my choice for online transactions over debit or credit cards whenever I’m in the country. In fact, since I got my credit card three years ago, I have never used it.With a boom in UPI payments in India, credit card transactions are on the decline, and I assumed that this was true in the rest of the world, too.But that’s apparently not the case. Cards continue to be the dominant payment method for many others globally, and stakeholders including merchants, card companies, and banks are fighting it out to make the most of it.Financial services firms like Mastercard and Visa set the fees that retailers must pay for processing card payments, which they revise from time to time. While small businesses can do little to negotiate this fee, big players like Amazon can easily turn the tables on card companies.In this week’s big story, my colleague Melissa Goh breaks down Amazon’s upcoming ban on Visa credit cards in the UK, signaling that the power balance is shifting between merchants, banks, and payment firms.This could also be an opportunity for other payment providers such as digital wallets and buy now, pay later players to gain more traction. As for Visa, it still has until early next year to resolve its issues with Amazon. Read on to know more.This week, analyst Simon Huang also breaks down Brazil-based Nubank’s success in Latin America following its stock debut on the New York Stock Exchange and what Southeast Asia’s digital banks can learn from it.A Happy New Year to all of you in advance! We’ll see you again in January.— SamreenTHE BIG STORYThe Amazon-Visa standoff: What’s the endgame?Image credit: Timmy LoenAmazon’s ban on Visa credit cards in the UK is a sign that the power balance between merchants, banks, and payment firms is shifting.THE HOT TAKEEmulating Nubank’s success in Southeast AsiaHere’s what happened:Nubank, the Brazil-based digital bank, had a successful stock market debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).Nubank grew by prioritizing user experience and focusing on markets that have large unbanked populations and inefficient legacy banks.In Southeast Asia, Indonesia is the most attractive market for digital banks, but it also has no restrictions on the number of players that can operate in the country.Here’s what it means:Nubank made its stock market debut last Thursday (December 9) on the NYSE.Initial investor interest has been ecstatic: Shares opened 25% over the offer price, giving the company a market value of almost US$52 billion.What lessons can Southeast Asia’s fledgling digital banks learn from Nubank?First, it’s important to serve a large market with low banking penetration. Currently, Nubank has a presence in three Latin American markets – Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia. Combined, these countries have a total population of 393 million people, with 134 million unbanked adults in 2017, according to the World Bank.A large population is a prerequisite to achieve the scale necessary to build a sustainable digital banking business in the long term. This was the basis for Nubank’s 12x customer base increase – from 4 million in the first quarter of 2018 to 48 million as of the third quarter of 2021.Aspiring digital banks in Southeast Asia cannot confine themselves to smaller, well-banked markets like Singapore and Malaysia. Instead, they must find ways to reach out to consumers in places like Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam.Second, it helps to have competitors that have large workforces, legacy systems, and existing bank branches, which are costly to operate.For example, Brazil has 17.9 commercial bank branches per 100,000 adults, which is above the global average of 14.1. The costs involved in maintaining these physical locations means incumbents spend more serving each active customer – approximately US$15.70 in Brazil. With no physical bank branches, Nubank’s equivalent costs are 85% lower.Again, this points to Indonesia as an attractive market for disruption. The archipelago has the highest number of commercial bank branches per 100,000 adults in Southeast Asia, at 15.2. Thailand has 11.2 bank branches per 100,000 adults, making it the runner-up.Third, it’s crucial for digital banks to prioritize user experience. Nubank started out with a single product (credit cards), but it achieved a net promoter score (NPS) of over 90. The average for banks globally is only 32.This resulted in strong word-of-mouth recommendations, which reduced Nubank’s customer acquisition costs to US$5 per customer and cemented its position as the primary bank for over 50% of its active customers who have been with the bank for more than 12 months.In comparison, the market leaders in Indonesia and Thailand currently have an NPS of 45 and 39, respectively.As a market for digital banks, Indonesia would appear to have a lot going for it. However, unlike in Singapore and Malaysia, which limit the number of their digital banks, Indonesia’s Financial Services Authority does not have a cap on the number of digital banks that can operate in the country, as long as certain minimum requirements are met.This will undoubtedly lead to more intense competition in Indonesia and may make a pan-Southeast Asian strategy more likely for many players. But it also introduces complexity, as banks have to deal with different regulators, languages, and cultures.No one said the road to success would be easy.— SimonNEWS YOU SHOULD KNOWCheck out Tech in Asia’s coverage of the fintech scene here.1️⃣ Sequoia co-leads $48m round of Indonesian fintech startup: Flip offers financial services including interbank transfers, overseas transfers, e-wallet top-ups, and salary transfers to employees of small and medium-sized businesses.2️⃣ India’s banking revolution has started without the banks: The country’s licensing policy for financial institutions is past its sell-by date.

A couple of drinks while closing deals and networking came within territory for him.But the issue was staying clear and productive the next day. He sought for hangover cures in the region, but none were truly effective. He turned toward US-based products, but only a few were able to work their magic well.In a bid to address hangovers, Ang, along with another former Grab executiveMinghao Teoh, launched Bounceback to help Asian white-collar professionals get back up on their feet after a late night of drinking.Photo credit: BouncebackLaunched in September, the Singapore-based firm’s anti-hangover pill is made of natural substances, with Dihydromyricetin (DHM) as its “hero ingredient.” Derived from the Japanese raisin tree, DHM helps metabolize alcohol faster by decreasing blood alcohol concentration and promoting alcohol clearance.The pill is made of 22 vitamins, antioxidants, and herbal extracts, which replenish the depleted nutrients caused by drinking. It is currently priced at S$49.90 (US$36.43) in Singapore and 109 ringgit (US$25.80) in Malaysia.While the product is available in Singapore, a pilot test is currently underway in Malaysia. The company aims to launch its product in 10 markets by the end of 2022.Investors take a shotIn September, Bounceback raised an undisclosed sum in a seed round from investors including SparkLabs Ventures, Farquhar Ventures, Paragon Capital, and Bonjour Holdings.(From left:) Bounceback founders Roy Ang and Minghao Teoh/Photo credit: BouncebackThe company is looking to raise another US$3 million in its pre-series A round by January 2022. It will use the funds to get approvals from various health regulators, complete its compliance process, and build its inventory.Bounceback will also use the new capital to ramp up hiring in its firm to a total of 25 employees. The company currently has eight full-time employees.Workday blues“White-collar workers are often subject to instances of drinking as they interact with people outside of a professional setting,” said Ang. Research also backs Ang’s statement: Regular drinkers make 10% to 14% more money than those who do not drink.Photo credit: lightfieldstudios / 123RFHowever, their recoveries after a late night drinking comes at a cost to companies and economies. For example, in Australia, sick days taken in the last two weeks of the year cost up to A$2 billion (US$1.6 billion) in lost productivity, with nearly 10% of employees opting for up to three sick days off before going back to work.Southeast Asia has witnessed a 34% increase in the consumption of alcohol between 2010 and 2017, driven by growing demand among countries in the low- and middle-income categories. Additionally, road traffic deaths due to alcohol consumption was among the top concerns in all countries and territories in the Asia-Pacific region in 2016.Lessons from Grab“Anthony [Tan, group CEO and co-founder of Grab] has a clear direction in what he wants to do. He has a strong mission-driven approach toward customer safety,” said Ang. He added that the Grab experience helps young professionals get a chance to learn a spectrum of skill sets.Photo montage by Tech in AsiaGrab has pushed companies to build communities similar to that of its own, which includes drivers and merchant partners, Ang said. Bounceback has also adopted this approach by distributing its pills at concerts anchored by local disc jockeys, instead of selling them through traditional pharmacies.Bounceback has also laid adequate emphasis on the design and layout of its product, which is in line with Grab’s strategy to create a strong brand.Photo credit: Bounceback“When a driver performs well, Grab gives them workshops on financial literacy and teaches them to manage their financial goals better,” Ang said. During his stint at Grab, he helped the company launch programs for drivers including investment savings and loan-related facilities.See also: Grab’s financial health in 8 chartsAng also noted that Tan believes in giving constructive feedback to his employees regarding the execution of plans and broader strategies. “He is always involved in ground-level work and talks to all the stakeholders.”Currency converted from Singapore dollar, Malaysian ringgit, and Australian dollar to US dollar: US$1 = S$1.37; US$1 = 4.23 ringgit; US$1= A$1.41.","While the product is available in Singapore, a pilot test is currently underway in Malaysia.

The platform, which is scheduled for a public launch by the end of the first quarter of 2022, will feature multi-format content and communities around women-centric issues, along with elements like social commerce, ecommerce, and brand stores. The app will be accessible from anywhere in the world.The platform will also have a layer of Web 3.0, allowing users to earn rewards from content creation, engagement, and curation, among other activities. These rewards will be available in the form of virtual tokens that can be used for purchasing in-app services and items. The company is also considering a feature that would let users exchange their tokens for real cash.While this feature will be available upon the platform’s launch, the company told Tech in Asia that it has not yet finalized the blockchain technology it will use. It has also not yet decided on whether it will use a crypto token due to uncertainties around cryptocurrencies and government policies.This is a similar model used by Philippine social media platform Lyka, which rewards users with GEMS (gift cards in electronic mode) that can be used to buy real-life goods and services – ranging from basic needs to luxury automobiles – within the Lyka ecosystem.See also: How social media app Lyka took the Philippines by stormFor privacy, Eve World says that it will have a safe onboarding process, including two-factor authentication and facial recognition.The Eve World platform is currently in its alpha stage, and it is being tested with a few thousand users, the company’s co-founder and CEO Tarun Katial told Tech in Asia.Katial comes with two decades of experience in the Indian media industry.

This is generally a recommendation to buy Grab’s stock, with the expectation of strong future performance.The investment bank attributes this rating, in part, to Grab’s massive presence in Southeast Asia. “In our view, Grab’s super-app ecosystem gives it a structural competitive advantage over peers with fewer services and limited geographical presence,” the JP Morgan report read.Starting out as a with ride-hailing service, Grab has since entered fintech, logistics, and food delivery, among a number of other spaces. It also recently secured licenses for digital banking in Singapore and Malaysia. This makes Grab one of the most active startups in Southeast Asia in terms of the number of verticals it operates in.According to JP Morgan, its wide regional net allows Grab to hold on to customers longer, with its one-year retention numbers climbing as consumers use more of its services.Consumers may also step up their in-app spending as they continue to use the company’s services. According to the report, users of the super app spent roughly 3.6x more in 2020 than they did when they first set up their accounts in 2016.See also: Grab’s position in SEA’s startup landscapeNirgunan Tiruchelvam, the head of Tellimer’s consumer sector equity research, agrees with the analysis.

Meanwhile, Tiruchelvam expects Grab’s gross merchandise value from the delivery segment to clock a compound annual growth rate of 32% from 2020 through 2024.JP Morgan also sees the delivery segment – which recently became the company’s biggest cash cow – bringing in over US$1 billion in revenue for Grab by the end of 2024.See also: Grab’s financial health in 8 chartsIn its most recent quarterly financial report, Grab saw its revenues from deliveries see a 58% year-on-year growth, while its mobility business saw a further 26% decline from last year.However, Shifara Samsudeen, part of LightStream Research’s team in Sri Lanka, previously told Tech in Asiathat while deliveries have helped Grab greatly in offsetting a slump in its mobility business, the GrabMart and GrabSupermarket services have recently been facing heightened competition from companies such as GoTo and Sea’s ShopeeFood.See also: Examining Grab’s incentive-fueled growth“Moreover, we think with resurgence of Covid cases and emergence of Omicron variants, it will be unlikely for Grab to pursue overseas expansion (for deliveries) anytime soon,” Samsudeen added. “So, if Grab’s mobility segment could make a meaningful recovery over the next couple of quarters, it will be one key catalyst for Grab’s future share price performance.”","Grab’s market price is expected to be volatile in the first half of 2022, but analysts see a smoother road ahead for the Singapore giant.",270460,Miguel Cordon,True,Collin Furtado and Arpit Nayak,0,"['Analysis', 'News', 'Transportation']","['deliveries', 'Grab', 'grab ipo', 'Grab shares', 'mobility', 'Singapore', 'startups in singapore']",False,,True,False,True,False,3

The payment giant’s UK-issued credit cards won’t be accepted on the ecommerce juggernaut’s local platform (amazon.co.uk) starting January 19, 2022, as it aims to encourage consumers to use better, lower-cost payment methods.Photo credit: 123rf.comThe move is the latest escalation of a years-long sticking point between merchants, payment networks, and banks. It comes after Visa raised fees for cross-border credit and debit card transactions between the UK and European Union. Amazon, however, said the ban was not about any one rule or fee, and that high costs of payment acceptance are a global problem that isn’t exclusive to the UK.“The cost of accepting card payments continues to be an obstacle for businesses striving to provide the best prices for customers. These costs should be going down over time with technological advancements, but instead they continue to stay high or even rise,” an Amazon spokesperson tells Tech in Asia.The fees in contention are known in the industry as interchange fees, or what a customer’s card-issuing bank charges a retailer for every transaction. This is just one – though significant – component of the merchant discount rate (MDR), which refers to the fees shouldered by retailers for processing card payments.Image credit: Timmy LoenSee also: Visual: The hefty cost of credit card paymentsPlayers in the Asia Pacific are reacting to the fee revisions more subtly. In Singapore and Australia, Amazon customers who shop on local sites have to pay a surcharge when they use Visa credit cards at checkout.Beginning in October, GrabPay users in Singapore who make top-ups to their e-wallet via Visa credit cards have to pay extra after Grab imposed a surcharge of S$1 (US$0.73) on such transactions. (For top-ups worth over US$292, the super app absorbs the fees.)The Amazon-Visa stand-off, however, is significant for a few reasons, though it’s unclear why the payments firm was singled out. In an interview with the Financial Times, Visa CEO Al Kelly said it was “inaccurate” to call the cost of accepting payments in the UK as high and described the Amazon ban as “odd.” Fellow payment titan Mastercard reportedly also charges similar fees in the UK.Amazon holds considerable sway by virtue of its size: It commands 25% of the UK ecommerce market – or US$29 billion in volume, according to Euromonitor estimates. However, that figure is just 0.26% of Visa’s total.This scuffle also comes at a time when alternative payment methods such as digital wallets and buy now, pay later programs are growing popular.As these alternative methods proliferate and consumers get comfortable with having more options, merchants become less reliant on any one mode of payment.Amazon has little to lose from its move.Should Visa concede, Amazon benefits from more preferential rates, setting a precedent for other major retailers. If Visa doesn’t, the move is Amazon’s first step towards weaning itself off the payments network in the UK, as the e-retailer experiments with other payment options including BNPL and direct bank transfers through Venmo.The popular votePayment companies bumping up their fees isn’t new: Mastercard and Visa typically revise their fees twice a year.“It is a fairly common business practice for card schemes to make adjustments in interchange fees for various commercial reasons,” Aung Kyaw Moe, CEO of payment gateway 2C2P tells Tech in Asia. This might include compensating card issuers for the benefits – such as more attractive rewards or travel miles – that they offer to signature cardholders.There’s also a bigger price to pay for convenience. To make up for the higher fraud risks, for instance, interchange fees go up for “card-not-present” online checkouts compared to those made at the point of sale. Requiring less customer information might reduce friction for users at the checkout process, but it also cost smore in interchange fees due to the risk of bad debt.Despite the rise of QR code payments, credit card transactions remain dominant in Singapore. And in a highly carded market like Singapore, merchants have little choice but to offer card acceptance despite its costs, or risk losing customers.Spencer Wong, director of business development at local womenswear and lifestyle brand The Editor’s Market, says that credit and debit card payments account for most of its income. Apart from operating an online storefront and four retail outlets in Singapore, the company also has shops in the United Arab Emirates, Thailand, and Cambodia.By Invite Only, a Singapore-based jeweler, says it spends “close to 4%” of its annual revenue to accept electronic payments via credit and debit cards, which account for 86% of its transactions at its retail stores. GrabPay contributes 6%.While BNPL options and GrabPay make up a larger percentage – about 35% combined – of By Invite Only’s online transactions, credit card payments still make up for an overwhelming 65%. While offering as many options as possible is ideal, merchants have to avoid overcrowding the checkout process, Trixie Khong, the company’s founder and CEO, tells Tech in Asia.Khong believes local MDR rates aren’t competitively priced. “My estimate is that a fair price to transact would be between 0.5% to 1.5% depending on the service offered and if currency exchange was involved … [but] we are far away from that,” she adds.Opaque feesInterchange fees are a closely guarded trade secret. Set them too high and merchants are less likely to support card payments; set them too low and issuing banks have little incentive to market cards to users.In Singapore, this opaqueness has spurred calls for banks and payment firms to disclose what they charge as interchange fees. However, there’s no existing mandate for the disclosure of such fees.While a fee increase on ecommerce transactions (among other revisions) looms large in the US, Wong says he isn’t aware of similar fee hikes in Asia.But with the blended price plan that The Editor’s Market pays to an intermediary payments processing firm, Wong says it’s impossible to know if revisions have already been factored in.Like Amazon, super app Grab has encouraged users in Singapore to explore different options when topping up their wallets to avoid incurring the Visa-related fee. These include using credit cards from other payment networks, bank transfer service PayNow, or funds transfers from other GrabPay users.A customer using GrabPay at a store / Photo credit: GrabPayWhile the surcharge was initially set to take effect in June, it was postponed by four months to “ensure that more GrabPay top-up options would be in place” so that consumers could choose the most suitable option, Chris Yeo, managing director and head of GrabPay and GrabRewards at Grab Financial Group, tells Tech in Asia.Similarly, neobank YouTrip is set in December to begin imposing a 1.5% service fee on users adding funds via Visa credit cards. The company declined to be interviewed for this story.Of course, choosing which payment providers to work with isn’t always about prices.Aside from the method’s popularity, Wong also considers the ease of accounting, perks offered, and the scope for marketing collaborations.That view is echoed by Lenskart, a direct-to-consumer eyewear retailer based in Southeast Asia. “We look at aspects such as reach and user experience, which not only includes the user interface but also overall experience aspects, such as ease of handling refunds,” says Kaushal Bhalotia, the company’s chief digital officer for the region.Lenskart, which operates over 800 physical stores in Southeast Asia and South Asia, says it also considers ease of technical integration, account management or support provided, fraud handling, and also the ability to scale as the company expands to new markets.Is the end of credit cards nigh?Visa’s fee hike may be an opportunity for other payment providers to gain more traction.“Inevitably, any increase in interchange fees will be carried over to the merchants. Merchants who are cost-sensitive may decide to prioritize certain types of payment options,” 2C2P’s Aung adds. Ultimately, it is up to “merchants and their consumers to decide which payment option to choose at the point of check out.”Because payment gateway companies like Adyen and 2C2P support an array of methods – from those offered by card schemes to local e-wallets – they’re largely agnostic towards the types of payments that merchants use.Visa did not respond to Tech in Asia’s requests for comment on this story. Mastercard declined to comment on a list of questions sent by Tech in Asia.To be sure, Visa isn’t putting all its eggs in one basket. It’s investing aggressively beyond its fee-dependent core payments network, which may be usurped by new payment methods and crypto-based payment infrastructure.The payments company has also been investing in open-banking capabilities. With these features, consumers can connect their bank accounts directly to apps, potentially eliminating the need for cards entirely.In line with that, Visa recently acquired Sweden-based Tink and Australian-based Basiq, an API platform that lets fintech customers access data from their bank accounts.In addition, Visa is letting financial institutions add BNPL as an option for credit card holders. Acquirers on the network can also enable installments for retailers that accept Visa via a new solution.Mastercard has a BNPL program of its own as well. The company is working with digital asset exchange Bakkt to allow merchants, banks, and fintech firms on its network to accept payments in cryptocurrency.Ultimately, consumers will vote with their wallets, so retailers and the entire payment ecosystem have to follow. But as more people warm up to digital payments, BNPL, crypto, and other new means of payment, everyone wins.Currency converted from Singapore dollar and British pound to US dollar: US$1 = S$0.73; US$1 = £1.32.","Amazon’s ban on Visa credit cards in the UK is a sign that the power balance between merchants, banks, and payment firms is shifting.",300605,Melissa Goh,True,Terence Lee and Eileen C.

724791,2021-12-15T01:50:38,2021-12-14T08:07:56,Visual: The hefty cost of credit card payments,visual-hefty-cost-credit-card-payments,visual-story,"Interchange fees – the rates set by companies like Visa and Mastercard for processing card transactions – have long been a flashpoint between the merchants who pay them to accept card payments, the banks that enable them, as well as the networks they ride on.These fees recently made the news after Amazon said it would ban UK-issued Visa credit cards next January, owing to Visa’s “high fees.”Interchange fees vary between geographies. In Europe, these can range from 0.3% to 0.4% of the transaction, while in the US, they average at 2%. In Singapore, interchange fees can range from around 2.5% to 2.8%, according to one retailer that Tech in Asia spoke to.While interchange fees are usually a relatively small percentage of the transaction, they can add up with the various other fees that apply to card payments.The fees are largely opaque, and in many markets, including Singapore, payment companies aren’t required to disclose publicly what they charge. In the European Union, the US, Australia, and Malaysia, there are caps to how much payment companies can charge.Interchange fees vary depending on a few factors, including:Card type: Fees are higher for credit cards compared to debit cards due to its associated credit risks.Premium vs basic card: Fees are higher for premium or signature cardholders, to compensate banks for providing more attractive rewards (e.g., miles).Online or offline transaction: Compared to physical checkouts, online or “card-not-present” transactions have larger fees due to the higher fraud risk.They’re also just one of many fees that a merchant has to fork out before they can accept card payments.To process card transactions, merchants pay their banks (“acquiring banks”) what’s known as a merchant discount rate (MDR). Interchange fees are just one component – albeit a significant part – of the MDR, and these are set by payment networks.To complicate things further, fee hikes are a fairly common business practice – Mastercard and Visa typically revise their fees twice a year for commercial reasons.Sometimes, these fees can be negotiated one-on-one depending on the size of the retailer and the volume of transactions they process, a practice that favors large marketplaces like Amazon. Small and medium-sized merchants, on the other hand, have comparatively little wiggle room in negotiating preferential rates.“Visa and Mastercard charge a consistent amount that is hard to negotiate because it really depends on transaction volumes,” Spencer Wong, director of business development at womenswear and lifestyle brand The Editor’s Market, tells Tech in Asia.“I believe it’s every retailer’s intention to negotiate for the lowest MDR where possible, and Visa [and] Mastercard could be more liberal in their pricing strategies,” Wong says. While “channels are open” with payment companies like Visa and Mastercard, “there’s little room to negotiate better rates,” he adds.With Amazon’s UK ban due to come into force in January next year, observers say there’s plenty of time for both parties to work toward a resolution. Whatever the eventual outcome, Amazon’s latest move sends an implicit signal to other retailers: diversify.CreditsEditing: Terence Lee and Lorenzo Kyle SubidoGraphics: Timmy Loen",Ever wondered what goes behind the three seconds it takes for your card transaction to be approved?,300605,Melissa Goh,True,Terence Lee and Lorenzo Kyle Subido,0,"['Fintech', 'Visual Stories']","['AmEx', 'credit cards', 'interchange fees', 'mastercard', 'MDR', 'merchant discount rate', 'payment processing', 'payment-gateway', 'visa']",False,,True,False,True,False,3

We break down the big and messy topics of Asia’s tech and startup community. Get the newsletter in your inbox everyday with a Premium subscription.Hello reader,I was never able to speak Mandarin well. Back in school, I remember questioning why it was important for me to learn the language. One of the most common responses I got was that as China becomes a global business giant, just speaking English alone won’t cut it.For today’s story, we see just how big of a powerhouse it’s become through the lens of the country’s largest exits. It’s an impressive list, to say the least. From giants in ecommerce to fintech companies, the amount of money involved in these exits could make anyone’s eyes water.Today we look at,20 Chinese companies that got the biggest payouts from their exitsAn India-based logistics company getting more fuel in the tankOther newsy highlights such as Binance’s possible move in Indonesia and T11’s US$100 million round led by Alibaba. Premium summaryIn the midst of the Middle KingdomImage credit: Timmy LoenTo me, one of the most fascinating things about China is how the country’s businesses have effectively created their own ecosystem for everything from social media to streaming. For every Western company, there always seems to be a Chinese counterpart to serve the country’s users. Many of the companies on this list are responsible for providing these ecosystems.Who else…: Number one on the list is none other than Alibaba Group, following its US$21.8 billion IPO in 2014. This figure is more than the combined total value of exits for the next six companies on our list. It’s not the only time Alibaba makes an appearance either – its acquisition of mobile browser company UCWeb for US$1.9 billion places the latter at the number nine spot.Youku and chill: Video-streaming companies make three appearances in our top 10: Youku, Kuaishou, and iQiyi. Combined, these companies’ exits have netted them a juicy US$9.5 billion, a testament to the strength of the video-streaming market in the country.No victory too small: Rounding off our list is Qudian, an installment payment and investment management platform that was founded in 2014. Even though it comes in at 20th place, it still made US$900 million from its IPO in 2017.Read more: 20 largest exits in ChinaStartup spotlightTo infinity and beyondPhoto credit: ShiprocketIndia-based logistics aggregator Shiprocket is looking to blast off with the additional US$185 million raised during its series E funding round, led by Zomato, Temasek, and Lightrock India. Other participants in the round included existing investors InfoEdge Ventures and March Capital, as well as new investors Moore Strategic Ventures, 9unicorns, IndiaMart co-founder Brijesh Agrawal, and Lenskart founder Peyush Bansal.Shipping out goods: Founded in 2017, the startup provides tech-shipping and fulfillment services to SMEs, direct-to-consumer retailers, and social commerce sellers. Some of the items that it helps ship out include apparel, footwear, healthcare, and electronics, among others.Playing with the big boys: Apart from these services, it also helps retailers integrate their digital stores with large platforms such as Zoho, Shopify, and Magento. Through these integrations, retailers can manage orders, workflow, and inventory.Adding value: Shiprocket plans to use these new funds in several ways. First, it’s looking to expand its core product, conduct research and development, hire new talent, and improve its suite of services. Additionally, it will invest in hyperlocal delivery services for lower turnaround times on deliveries and put some of the new funding toward global expansion.Quick bytes1️⃣ Giving it a passShares for Society Pass, a Vietnam-based tech firm incorporated in the US, dipped 10% last Thursday amid weak Q3 results. According to the company, losses from operations grew by over 5x to reach US$8.4 million. This marks an overall loss of almost 90% of its stock value since last month, when the company first went public on the Nasdaq.2️⃣ Cashing outEmployees of Singapore telco firm Circles Life will soon be able to sell off their company stock options. The telco is currently planning to buy back US$5 million worth of these stocks, which are awarded to employees each year as part of its employee stock ownership plan. Staff members who have been with the company for a few years can expect to earn up to six figures in cash from this, according to Rameez Ansar, co-founder of Circles Life.3️⃣ Exploring Indonesian shoresCryptocurrency exchange Binance is in talks to open up an exchange in Indonesia, according to a Bloomberg report. It is currently discussing the move with state-owned Telkom Group and Indonesian financial institution Bank Central Asia (BCA), the latter of which may partner with Binance through another related firm.4️⃣ More excuses to play gamesAdoption of play-to-earn gaming in Southeast Asia got a boost after Yield Guild Games Southeast Asia raised US$15 million across two rounds of financing.

Best viewed on larger screens.Built with d3.js. Modified from Mike Bostock’s original les Misérables Co-occurrence.Data: Tech in AsiaInfographics: Ivan TanLast year, we dug deep into the relationship dynamics that drive Southeast Asia’s VCs.Peeling back the layers of the enigmatic VC scene, we uncovered how investors aligned themselves with each other and the different approaches they had toward co-investments.A year on, we’ve updated our matrix diagram. The graph is a visualization of startup co-investments over the past three years, and each colored cell represents two entities that co-invested in the same round. The darker the cell color, the more frequent those two entities co-invested together.This time, we’re curious to find out: Did the same alliances hold true? Are VCs sticking with the same buddies or growing their circles? Are there also new entrants that may potentially disrupt existing relationships?To answer these questions, we’ll examine Tech in Asia’s data on Southeast Asia’s funding rounds in 2021.A look at the leaderboardFirst off, we’ve noticed a significant reshuffling over the past year in the top 20 most active VCs in Southeast Asia in terms of deals made.New entrants in the roster include institutional investors like the Singapore Economic Development Board’s venture arm EDBI and Temasek Holdings, as well as VCs like Global Founders Capital, which previously focused more on other regions such as Europe.Temasek, in particular, has co-invested with Insignia Ventures Partners, Jungle Ventures, Sequoia Capital, and Wavemaker Partners. Some of its investments went to Indonesia’s GoTo, online fashion unicorn Zilingo, as well as a range of greentech startups such as alternative protein developer Growthwell Foods and waste management firm Lumitics.Deals that saw government-linked entities as co-investors also soared. Enterprise Singapore’s venture arm Seeds Capital, for example, nearly doubled its deal count for co-investments from 18 to 34.Although the top five most active investors have mostly kept their previous positions, the gap between each of them has significantly narrowed. Case in point: fifth-place Insignia Ventures Partners, which injected new capital into some of its portfolio companies via a recently closed investment vehicle, has reduced the gap with front-runner Sequoia Capital by nearly fivefold.VC circles got biggerIn our previous analysis, we identified different types of VC pairings and then labeled the ones with three co-investment deals or more together as intentional, rather than coincidental.This time, we wanted to investigate whether VCs have doubled down on their earlier co-investment buddies or teamed up with new ones.To do so, we calculated the standard deviation between the number of times a VC firm has co-invested with each of the other companies on the list. The higher the standard deviation, the deeper the relationships they’re likely to have.Here’s what we found among the top five most active investors.Compared to our previous analysis, the standard deviations of the top five VC firms suggest that they have become less agnostic over the past year.First off, the number of intentional VC pairings among the top five has skyrocketed from 19 to 75. This tells us that, over the last year, VCs have opened their doors to more co-investors.There’s also a higher number of pairings with more than three co-investment deals across the board, indicating that VCs also appear to be deepening relationships with new co-investors.On the whole, we found that the top five most active VCs made 42.4% more co-investment deals in 2021, adding up to 269 this year from 155 in 2020.Newcomers to the partyWho, then, are the new co-investors among the group? Here, government-linked entities are making a splash: Sequoia Capital partnered with EDBI the most, and the number of co-investments that Wavemaker Partners made with Seeds Capital is twice as many as the deals it made with its next highest co-investor.It isn’t just government-linked entities that are entering the fray, though. From what our data tells us, co-investments in Southeast Asia are coming from an increasingly diverse crowd.One such group of newcomers is Chinese corporations and VC firms like Kuaishou, ZhenFund, and Boyu Capital.With predominantly China-focused portfolios, their arrival in Southeast Asia could hint at their desire to look for investment opportunities abroad in industries that have been denied at home due to regulatory pressures.Another segment that’s making waves is the startup-turned-investor group like Indonesian fintech firms Payfazz and Ovo, as well as travel unicorn Traveloka.Payfazz has co-invested with Insignia Ventures Partners, while Ovo and Traveloka have co-invested with East Ventures. This could hint at the growing trend of VC-funded startups increasingly making their own bets in other startups in the region.As more investors enter Southeast Asia’s VC scene, being open to making new friends might be the way forward.","Southeast Asian VCs are buddying up more, but newcomers look set to disrupt their relationships.",530158,Tay Tian Wen,True,Terence Lee and Jaclyn Tiu ,0,"['Premium Content', 'Visual Stories']","['investments', 'Southeast Asia', 'VC', 'venture capital']",False,,True,True,True,False,4
