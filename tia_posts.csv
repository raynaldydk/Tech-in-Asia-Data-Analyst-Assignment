Loco has onboarded popular Indian streamers like Sc0ut, Mavi, Jonathan, Villager Esports, and more onto its platform. The company says it has built communities across games such as Battlegrounds Mobile India, Call of Duty Mobile, Clash of Clans, and Grand Theft Auto.
Since January 2021, the company‚Äôs daily active viewers have experienced a 15x growth. The firm also saw an 8x jump in monthly active viewers, a 5x increase in active streamers, and a 78x surge in live watch hours over the same period.
The streaming platform is run by Anirudh Pandita and Ashwin Suresh, co-founders of Pocket Aces, a digital studio that creates streaming content. Pocket Aces acquired Loco, which was then known as Showtime App, in 2018.
Loco plans to use the fresh capital to invest in the development of the Indian gaming ecosystem and cement its position in the streaming space.
‚ÄúWe believe this new investment round will enable Loco to solidify its dominant position in game streaming and eventually provide the Indian gaming community with cutting-edge Web3 products and services,‚Äù Ethan Kim, co-founder and partner at Hashed, said in a statement.

What it means to be a woman in the Southeast Asian tech and startup ecosystem

Image credit: Tech in Asia

For better or worse, being a female founder or entrepreneur brings with it some unique experiences. And there‚Äôs no better way to learn about these experiences than from the women themselves.


Making a mark: In our survey of female entrepreneurs in the region, five key themes emerged around the best part of being a founder: innovation, freedom, impact, inspiration, and passion. A majority of our respondents cited how satisfying it was to innovate and create, while some expressed how much they enjoyed the freedom that comes with being an entrepreneur.


Hurdles: Broadly speaking, the most common stumbling blocks for participants were talent, leadership, bias and doubt, and funding.


A woman‚Äôs touch: Over 77% of respondents felt that being female has made a difference in their entrepreneurial journeys. They regard it as a positive element, particularly crediting how women can tap into empathy to produce results and propel their companies to success.

ElevationSpace, a Japan-based spacetech startup, has raised US$2.7 million in seed funding from Genesia Ventures, Plug and Play Japan, and Tohoku University Venture Partners, among others. Including its pre-seed funding, the company has raised a total of about US$3 million to date.


She packed my bags last night, pre-flight: Originating from Tohoku University in Japan, ElevationSpace is developing a space environment utilization and recovery satellite to replace the International Space Station (ISS).


I miss the Earth so much, I miss my wife: The company has built more than 10 small satellites and is developing a unit called ElevationSpace-Recovery (ELS-R), which can conduct space experiments, tests, and manufacturing inside the satellite. The company says that its ELS-R satellites are much cheaper and easier to use than the ISS because its service doesn‚Äôt require crew members and is smaller.


It‚Äôs just my job, five days a week: ElevationSpace‚Äôs first launch of the ELS-R satellite is planned for 2023 and will use atmospheric reentry technology. The company is aiming for six launches per year by 2030.

In total, the company has raised US$77 million in funding to date. VentureCap Insights pegged the firm‚Äôs valuation at around US$230 million.

(From left) Cialfo founders Stanley Chia, Rohan Pasari, and William Hund / Photo credit: Cialfo

Founded by Rohan Pasari, Stanley Chia, and William Hund in 2017, Cialfo is a software-as-a-service firm that simplifies the career exploration and college search process by connecting high schoolers, counselors, and colleges. It charges annual subscriptions for education institutions, while keeping the platform free for students.
The firm currently has 270,000 active students on its platform, with around 70% of them coming from India, Southeast Asia, and China. It also has more than 1,000 colleges in 50 countries using its platform.
Cialfo plans to use the fresh funding to develop its product, enhance its marketing initiatives, hire new employees, and explore strategic acquisition opportunities.
Investor interest
When Pasari signed the term sheet for the initial US$40 million series B funding, which was led by Square Peg and Seek Investments, he said Tiger Global quickly approached him to join the round.
‚ÄúI said, the round is over. The round is also oversubscribed, as we initially only wanted to raise around US$20 million. I told them to enter the next round in the next six to 12 months,‚Äù Pasari told Tech in Asia.
However, Tiger Global insisted on investing in the same round, so the co-founder accepted the request and signed another term sheet after a ‚Äúquick‚Äù due diligence process from the VC firm.

While Cialfo isn‚Äôt profitable right now, Pasari said it has healthy gross margins and unit economics and that the company ‚Äúcan be profitable as soon as next year if we want.‚Äù
In 2022, the company plans to add more features, such as direct application capabilities in mobile devices, and career journey path that can help students in determining their future. It also wants to capitalize on its historical data on student acceptance at various universities and turn it into career suggestions for new users.
Cialfo currently has more than 200 employees ‚Äì a third of them work in product development, another third in marketing, and the rest in customer support and operations. Of its headcount, Pasari said 51% are women.
Inspired by experience
Having been born and raised in Calcutta, Pasari said that he had no idea how to apply for universities in other countries when he was a student. Fortunately, two universities from Singapore ‚Äì Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and the National University of Singapore ‚Äì came to his high school. He ended up getting a scholarship from NTU and becoming an engineering major.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a life changing impact for me, and that‚Äôs the main idea of Cialfo,‚Äù Pasari explained.

Cialfo co-founder Rohan Pasari / Photo credit: Cialfo

At NTU, he met Chia when they both took an entrepreneurship course. The two were part of different teams and ended up competing against each other, which Pasari said built their respect for one another.
‚ÄúWe decided that if we wanted to build a company, we should team up,‚Äù he said.
The duo then built Cialfo and marketed the product to a large education company in Shanghai, where Hund was working as head of product. He asked to join the company instead, and two months later, he was already in Singapore as the firm‚Äôs chief product officer.
According to Pasari, the biggest challenge for Cialfo right now is hiring the best talent and keeping the company focused.

Delivered every Thursday via email and through the Tech in Asia website, this free newsletter breaks down the biggest stories and trends in ecommerce. If you‚Äôre not a subscriber, get access by registering here.
Hi there,
Sometimes the best way to let something grow is to let it go.
When Alibaba bought Lazada in 2016, expectations were sky-high. The Chinese ecommerce giant injected about US$4.4 billion into Lazada between 2018 and 2020. At the time, Lazada was poised to dominate Southeast Asia‚Äôs ecommerce scene.
But things didn‚Äôt pan out that way ‚Äì Shopee‚Äôs early days coincided with a period of turmoil at Lazada, marred by culture conflicts between headquarters and local teams, as well as frequent leadership changes.
However, recent developments suggest Alibaba is no longer looking to tighten its grip on Lazada. The Chinese group is now working on potentially spinning off its Southeast Asian ecommerce arm through an IPO, Bloomberg reported.
For Alibaba, intensifying regulatory pressure at home and weaker consumer spending have spurred the need to expand in overseas markets. The growth runway is still pretty long in Southeast Asia, where online shopping could generate US$234 billion in GMV by 2025.
For this week‚Äôs Big Story, I write about why all signs point toward an IPO for Lazada. It‚Äôs even more timely now that competitor Shopee is stretching thin in new markets and a public listing could give Lazada much-needed ammunition.

THE BIG STORYWhy Alibaba should spin off Lazada

Image credit: Timmy Loen

As Alibaba faces challenges in its home court, a Lazada IPO could unlock massive runway growth for its ecommerce ambitions in Southeast Asia.

THE HOT TAKEBehind Shopee‚Äôs quick exit from France
Here‚Äôs what happened:

Shopee bid adieu to France just a couple of months after launching its localized platform in the country.
Shopee told Tech in Asia that its operations in France were a short-term preliminary pilot.
Investors are concerned about the rising costs of Shopee‚Äôs expansion into new markets like Latin America and Europe.

Here‚Äôs our take:
Tech in Asia previously analyzed why Latin America makes a lot of sense in Shopee‚Äôs global quest. The average ecommerce penetration in Latin America is 6% ‚Äì similar to that in Southeast Asia. Garena‚Äôs Free Fire has been one of the top-grossing mobile games in Brazil, so it can provide players rewards for using Shopee.
The French market has always been an outlier, but the Sea Group‚Äôs startup DNA means that it has to test the waters. Analysts have noted that Shopee‚Äôs performance in France had underperformed from the start.
France is among the top 10 countries worldwide in its share of retail ecommerce sales, which came in at 11.2% in 2021, according to eMarketer estimates. An estimated 76% of its population are already shopping online. Besides general marketplaces like Amazon and Cdiscount, France has some notable niche ecommerce players or online-to-offline retailers like Vestiaire Collective, Veepee, Auchan, and Sportamore.
In Southeast Asia, Shopee‚Äôs model has been seen as enabling small merchants to sell online, and most of these sellers focus on sourcing low-price products from China. However, a growing number of consumers in developed European markets are shifting to affordable but high-quality goods from resale platforms.
It‚Äôs not a coincidence that Paris-headquartered Vestiaire Collective, a luxury resale marketplace has raised more than US$660 million so far, according to Crunchbase data. At the helm of Vestiaire Collective is Max Bittner, who co-founded Lazada in 2012 and served as its CEO until 2018. Bittner also recently invested in Singapore‚Äôs Reebelo, a marketplace for pre-owned devices.
No doubt, Shopee‚Äôs breakneck expansion is costly.

Shopee‚Äôs investors are getting impatient, and competitors ‚Äì especially in the ecommerce firm‚Äôs core markets ‚Äì are not sitting still: TikTok Shop has entered Southeast Asia, Grab is piloting a live commerce feature, and Lazada could be refueled if Alibaba can get the right valuation for a potential spin-off.
And what about the shift in the consumer mindset? At the moment, Shopee shouldn‚Äôt have to worry about Southeast Asia‚Äôs consumers pulling back from buying its marketplace‚Äôs low-cost offerings and new goods. But that can change down the road as income levels rise alongside a greater awareness for sustainability and the environment.
While Shopee decided to back out of France on its own, in India ‚Äì where Free Fire was recently banned ‚Äì Shopee may not be in control of its future.

736138,2022-03-10T06:00:59,How remote work can level the playing field for women in the workplace,"This article is part of ‚ÄúBreak the Bias,‚Äù Tech in Asia‚Äôs campaign for International Women‚Äôs Day 2022. Through this initiative, we‚Äôre shining the spotlight on the women who are breaking barriers and achieving success in Asia‚Äôs tech and startup ecosystem.

Since the pandemic upended traditional working arrangements, companies all over the world ‚Äì from Facebook to LinkedIn ‚Äì have recognized the importance of enabling people to work remotely.
As much of the business world leaves physical offices behind in favor of better employee productivity and engagement, it‚Äôs clear that remote working is here to stay.
But while these benefits for the general workforce are apparent, one demographic could stand to gain even more: women.
The importance of mobility
Remote work and its associated technologies ‚Äì such as video conferencing ‚Äì are so powerful for women in particular because these tools can help level the playing field in work arrangements, says Jess Dodge, chief growth officer at global employment platform Globalization Partners.

Jess Dodge, chief growth officer at Globalization Partners / Photo credit: Globalization Partners

This is important because women face several disadvantages in the business world. For instance, even if women are employed, they are still likely to care for household members at the same time, spending more than 1.1 trillion hours doing so each year, while men clock in less than 400 billion hours.
‚ÄúWomen are often called upon first to be caregivers for either elderly parents or their own children,‚Äù explains Dodge. ‚ÄúThose women need to be close to their parents [and children] to take care of them, so their ability to move and get jobs in different states or countries becomes even more difficult.‚Äù
This leads to labor immobility for women. According to a study by researchers at Dortmund University, male workers are anywhere from 5% to 15% more mobile than women, which means they are more likely to travel frequently for work or take up opportunities that require them to relocate.
While this could be a personal downside for men, it opens up more job options for them. Conversely, the fact that women are less mobile for work also means that career advancement can be trying.
Based on her own experience, Dodge says women with caregiving duties often won‚Äôt even bother applying for a job that requires them moving far away.
Solving the core issue will take time ‚Äì cultural norms will need to shift before such a systemic change can occur. But Dodge acknowledges that remote work can give women opportunities to pursue their career aspirations beyond geographical location, while also allowing them to carry out caregiving duties.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really opening people‚Äôs minds to what they could potentially do,‚Äù Dodge adds.
Equal access, equal opportunities
Another major advantage that remote work brings for women is providing them with access to opportunities in companies or countries with practices and environments that have less gender biases.
Within the wider East Asia and Pacific region, a study from the World Economic Forum (WEF) showed that at the current rate of progress, it would still take another 100 years to completely close the workplace gender gap. This stands in contrast to other regions such as Eastern Europe, which according to the WEF will take another 54 years to achieve workplace gender parity.
While regions such as Southeast Asia have made some progress toward greater workplace equality and diversity ‚Äì 17.1% of board seats in the region were held by women in 2021, a 2.8% increase from three years prior ‚Äì there is still room for improvement.
In the meantime, remote work opens up more choices for women held back by the social or cultural norms in their locality.
‚ÄúCompanies will be driven to change if they are not attracting top talent. Values, pay, time off, and benefits are the main priorities of candidates who now have more choices to not only work for companies headquartered close to them but also companies anywhere in the world,‚Äù says Dodge.
Working remotely can also free women from certain workplace pressures. In an office, for example, women might feel discouraged from doing certain things like speaking up in a meeting.

Photo credit: diego_cervo / 123RF

‚ÄúWith technologies like video conferencing, women are now in the same size box as everybody else on that screen, and so is every person at every level of the organization who happens to be in that meeting,‚Äù Dodge shares.
Without a physical representation of the power structures within an organization, remote work conditions can give women the metaphorical space and confidence to speak their minds.
Evolving dynamics
In the coming years, remote work is set to have far-reaching effects in promoting greater equality. For instance, Dodge points out that men who take care of household members will also stand to gain the same advantages from remote working opportunities as women.
The more flexible setup could also create ways for both men and women to take on responsibilities in caregiving and allow companies to offer equal benefits, such as parental leave. With this, men and women can take on an equal share of household tasks without affecting their jobs.
Beyond that, remote setups could also help people with disabilities, especially those who struggle with physical movement.
Ultimately, companies themselves will have to learn to accommodate their workers‚Äô various needs.
Businesses can provide tools for an employee who doesn‚Äôt have the right equipment to work from home, for instance, or they could also forgo centralized offices in favor of renting out smaller satellite workspaces, allowing their staff to separate their work and rest environments.
‚ÄúThe reality is, companies are going to have to evolve to accommodate lots of different remote work situations. And those that excel at this will also excel at attracting the best talent to build a successful remote global team,‚Äù Dodge foresees.

The ecommerce platform, which has offices in the US and Hong Kong, was founded in 2008 by Johnny Mak. The new round is also the company‚Äôs first-ever fundraise since its establishment.
Kicks Crew is looking to tap into the booming global footwear market, which is estimated to be worth nearly US$400 billion. The company is also eyeing the US‚Äô footwear apparel and accessories market, which it estimates to be worth US$200 billion.
The ecommerce firm did not disclose financials but said its gross merchandise value grew 15x year-over-year in FY 2021.
Its web traffic has grown more than 5x since January 2021, driven by growth in its key markets. Traffic from Canada rose 20x while visits from US and Australia grew 19x, Kicks Crew co-founder and COO Ross Yip told Tech in Asia.
Yip previously served as director of business development at Goat, a US-based sneaker marketplace.
He further revealed that Gen Y and Gen Z make up 60% of the company‚Äôs customer base, the largest market in terms of age groups. Meanwhile, female customers account for 40% of the platform‚Äôs sales.
‚ÄúWe have also noticed significant growth in repeat customers over the past year. With new product functions such as livestreaming, we will enhance our interactions and engagement with our customers and expect growth in our increasingly loyal customer base,‚Äù Yip added.

Home Credit is reportedly seeking between US$2 billion and US$2.5 billion for the assets. While some of the bidders are interested in acquiring all of the company‚Äôs businesses, others are only looking to buy its assets in Southeast Asia, according to the source.
Founded in 1997 by Czech entrepreneur Petr Kellner, Home Credit has operations in nine countries across Asia and Europe. It allows users to do online and offline transaction, and pay for it in installments.
The acquisition may strengthen Grab‚Äôs financial services segment, which is set to become one of the company‚Äôs focuses this year. The super app‚Äôs revenue slumped 44% to US$122 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 due to a downturn in its mobility and enterprise and new initiatives segments.

This startup is betting on it and seeking $15m,"SmartClean Technologies, a Singapore-based B2B cleaning automation startup, tells Tech in Asia that it is raising US$15 million in a series A round. The fundraise is a mix of equity and debt, with US$12 million in equity and US$3 million in venture debt funding.
The company is closing its debt fundraise this month, while the equity funding is expected to be secured by June.

SmartClean‚Äôs team in Singapore / Photo credit: SmartClean

Founded in 2017, SmartClean has built artificial intelligence of things (AIoT) and SaaS cleaning management products to monitor, measure, and manage commercial real estate facilities.
RealSense is the AIoT product consisting of hardware sensors installed in a facility that can sense if something is dirty and notify cleaning staff in real time. It can also measure the level of cleanliness in commercial buildings through CleanScore, a standardized metric created by the company.
The SaaS product, Matrix, is an operating system for cleaning companies and facilities management firms that enables them to digitize backend processes and track the hygiene level of their locations.
SmartClean says that it will use 60% of its series A funding to add 30 more partners to its network ‚Äì the company‚Äôs primary sales channel ‚Äì in the next 12 months. It will also be used to start operations in Australia, the US, and the Middle East.
The rest of the funds will be allotted for hiring, as the firm looks to grow its engineering, product development, and business teams by 3x. The company currently has 45 employees based out of Singapore and India, and it looks to scale its team to 120 employees globally.
SmartClean is already in eight markets via partnerships and plans to launch in over 30 countries by the end of this year. Some of its partners include Integra in the Philippines, Active Telematics in Malaysia, Ecocare in Indonesia, Powerful in Hong Kong, Verteco in the United Arab Emirates, and a robotics firm in Japan.
Hard to get a little VC money
Prior to its current fundraise, the company secured about US$3 million from three rounds of funding. In September 2021, SmartClean raised US$2.7 million in a pre-series A round co-led by Seeds Capital.
While SmartClean is in talks with several VC firms on its series A funding, CEO Lav Agarwal shares that it wasn‚Äôt easy for the company back in 2017 as it had only developed its hardware product ‚Äì the sensors ‚Äì at that time.

An employee holding SmartClean‚Äôs RealSense sensors / Photo credit: SmartClean

‚ÄúBack then, even less than 5% of the VCs were actually interested in investing in a hardware startup. More than 95% of the VCs would straight away say ‚Äòno‚Äô if they heard that hardware was a main product of the company,‚Äù recalls Agarwal.
Despite that, Agarwal realized that the company was getting more interest from strategic investors such as companies in security automation, cleaning, and hygiene. After its pre-seed funding from CapitaLand‚Äôs accelerator program AIRmaker, SmartClean‚Äôs next investment came from the co-CEOs of OneBerry Technologies, a security automation company in Singapore.
Other strategic investors in SmartClean include Chye Thiam Maintenance, a cleaning company in Singapore, and Ecocare, a hygiene firm in Indonesia.
Since SmartClean currently has a SaaS product as a major part of its offering, Agarwal says that it is now being approached by major VC firms. The founders, with their stakes combined (including a small ESOP pool), own about 54% of the firm, according to VentureCap Insights.
Sweeping past Covid-19
The company had commercially launched its products in late 2019, two years after it was founded. It partners with real estate facility management firms such as Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL), CBRE, and Sodexo, among others.

SmartClean offers its sensors as well as its SaaS platform on a subscription basis to facilities management firms, commercial property owners, and cleaning companies. The startup signs a minimum three-year contract with its clients, who pay them a monthly fee. These long-term contracts, Agarwal says, ensure that there is less churn unlike other B2B firms.
However, shortly after its commercial launch, the firm was hit by the Covid-19 pandemic, with many clients freezing their contracts due to work-from-home mandates.
‚ÄúCovid helped us as well as disrupted our growth,‚Äù Agarwal tells Tech in Asia.
In 2020, SmartClean signed a contract with JLL‚Äôs facilities management team for its Accenture portfolio of around 60 office buildings across India. However, the three-year contract, worth S$60,000 (US$44,000) in monthly recurring revenue, was suspended after the pandemic hit.
Despite these setbacks, SmartClean‚Äôs revenue hit S$250,000 (US$183,000) in 2020 and S$1 million (US$733,000) in 2021. This year, it is on track to reach S$4 million (US$2.9 million) in annual recurring revenue, shares Agarwal.
‚ÄúAlmost 80% of the revenue came from Singapore, given the lockdowns here were only two months, and only 20% came from India,‚Äù he says. The CEO adds that the company‚Äôs Indian operations are looking to bounce back this year, as it already has ‚Äúa pipeline of 200 buildings with JLL.‚Äù
With companies around the world opening up their offices, SmartClean hopes to capitalize on the rising need to keep workplaces clean to protect employees from the spread of Covid-19.
‚ÄúBefore the pandemic, there was never a clear thought of standardization or even a demand from users to know how clean the office space is. However, the mindset has shifted in the last two years, which has given more importance to the type of systems offered by SmartClean that digitizes cleanliness. People started to ask how clean is clean,‚Äù Agarwal shares.
The CEO estimates the company‚Äôs overall addressable market today to be around US$50 billion globally.
The global cleaning services market is expected to reach US$88.9 billion by 2025 from about US$60 billion in 2019, according to a Beroe report.
From robots to sensors
In its early days of trying to get investors, SmartClean received feedback that led to a dramatic pivot for the startup.
SmartClean‚Äôs journey began in 2015 as a robotics startup. Its two engineer founders ‚Äì Agarwal and Abhishek Mishra ‚Äì met while pursuing their Ph.D.s at the National University of Singapore, and their initial idea was to create a robotic security system that would replace the need for human guards to patrol an area.

But while they were pitching to several investors, they realized that they needed two to three years of development and heavy investment to take a robotics system to the market. Agarwal says that this is the main reason why they pivoted toward sensors, which would only take under a year to develop.
Shortly after this pivot, Agarwal met the third co-founder, Stella Aw, who used to run a cleaning company called Spotless. This pointed them to the cleaning industry, which was almost entirely manual.
‚ÄúThe biggest pain point for the industry was ‚Äì and even is today ‚Äì that there is virtually no data,‚Äù says Agarwal. ‚ÄúIf you look at any infrastructure, private, or commercial property, when anyone says that a property is clean, there is no data point to even refer to or standard on how clean is clean.‚Äù
However, the company‚Äôs initial ambitions of getting into the robotics space isn‚Äôt over. It‚Äôs creating an autonomous cleaning division that integrates third-party cleaning robots with its existing products. With this, the new platform will not only detect dirty spots, but also direct a robot to clean it up.
Agarwal says that the team‚Äôs plan is to make SmartClean an aggregator for the cleaning industry, much like what Uber did for the taxi industry. It looks to pass on work to various cleaning companies, which Agarwal says will eventually adopt cleaning robots as a norm. Currently, labor accounts for 80% of the total operational costs in the cleaning industry.
‚ÄúIf SmartClean becomes the standard of cleaning, we can then directly work with a property and subcontract the cleaning manpower portion to a cleaning company,‚Äù says Agarwal.

But if robots will replace cleaning staff, why can‚Äôt SmartClean create its own cleaning robot instead? To this, Agarwal says the company would rather acquire a robotics firm down the line that will be integrated into its products. However, he stressed that the company at the moment would want to keep its aggregator platform open to third-party cleaning companies.
US headquarters in mind
SmartClean, which is now also incorporated in the US, plans to eventually move its headquarters to the country. Agarwal expects to do so by the time of its next round of funding.
The company is looking to raise about US$30 million to US$35 million in its series B round, for which it will start the process by the middle of next year.

The startup will first enter the US by creating a strategic partner network to mitigate the high cost of launching in the country. It expects to set up an office in either New York or Chicago ‚Äì which are the biggest proptech markets in the US ‚Äì by the end of this year.
The US is one of the largest markets in the proptech and cleaning services space. While the global cleaning services market size is expected to reach US$111 billion by 2030, the US is set to take a dominant share of the revenue.
SmartClean is also looking to leverage the relationships it currently has with facilities management companies that are headquartered in the US.
‚ÄúWithin the Manhattan and Chicago area, there are thousands of commercial buildings. If we can just crack a few of these ecosystems, that itself will give us hundreds of buildings at one time,‚Äù concludes Agarwal.

733452,2022-03-10T04:00:35,"QuickBytes: Changing the edfintech game with Carmina Bayombong, InvestEd‚Äôs CEO","As part of Tech in Asia‚Äôs 2022 International Women‚Äôs Day campaign ‚ÄúBreak The Bias,‚Äù we conducted a survey of female founders in Southeast Asia to learn more about their experiences. We also sat down with some founders from the region to dive deeper into their stories. Here‚Äôs one of them.

Carmina Bayombong is the co-founder and CEO of InvestEd, an education and fintech startup in the Philippines. In January this year, she was named by the Cartier Women‚Äôs Initiative as one of its nine ‚ÄúImpact Awardees.‚Äù

In this interview, Bayombong talks about what InvestEd hopes to achieve, her experiences as a Filipino startup founder, and what she envisions for the Southeast Asian startup scene in the future.
The following interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.
What does your startup aim to do?
Today, there are about 30 million college-age youths and early-career professionals in the Philippines who can‚Äôt afford upskilling and therefore can‚Äôt move up in life, especially in the pandemic. InvestEd exists to change this reality by trying to help these young people overcome these barriers to success.
We provide success essentials for under-resourced youth through our program, which offers services covering what we call ‚Äúthe three Cs‚Äù ‚Äì capital, coaching, and community. We provide capital for education and upskilling, such as tuition fee loans. We also provide skills coaching to young people to navigate challenges they face with education and adulthood, as well as a community to provide social and emotional support to youth on this journey.
To date, we‚Äôve done about US$1 million in loans to about 1,500 students, with a very good repayment rate, and we‚Äôve raised more than US$2 million in funding.
What are the best and worst things about being an entrepreneur?
I would say the best thing about being a founder is that ability to execute a unique vision. I‚Äôve always had this vision to reduce the barriers to success for young people because when I was growing up, I saw first-hand how challenging it can be. If they aren‚Äôt able to get access to capital, coaching, and community support by the time they‚Äôre 30, their potential is often forever capped. I also hated redundancy in the sector and wanted to execute my own unique vision to really tackle this problem. Being a founder has allowed me to create this new version of the world that I imagined.

The worst thing would be the burnout. To me, innovation is fundamentally changing the way something is done, like what Uber did for transportation. At InvestEd, we‚Äôre trying to change the status quo. We‚Äôre trying to change up how parents understand success, how employers understand success, and how schools understand success because now it‚Äôs all credentials-based. We‚Äôre trying to change how financial institutions see students because students are seen as unbankable and risky, even more so if they‚Äôre from low-income backgrounds. You feel like a broken record, and you can get pretty run-down as a founder doing that ‚Äì trying to talk to all the stakeholders and get them to see things from a different point of view.
What‚Äôs the biggest challenge you‚Äôve faced on your journey so far?
That the playing field is not equal for Filipino startup founders, especially for the founders who aren‚Äôt from affluent families and don‚Äôt have Ivy League educations. Most of us don‚Äôt have that kind of pedigree that investors are looking for, and we always have to try three times harder to get a meeting, three times harder to get funding. Our networks aren‚Äôt as large, and the quality of advice we receive is not the same as that of founders who were able to go abroad and develop those connections.
Additionally, seed funding in the Philippines has been so small. It‚Äôs only recently that it‚Äôs becoming decent. As late as last year, seed funding here was something like US$10,000. What can you do with that? As a result, many founders have to work side jobs, and they can‚Äôt focus fully on their startups.
Have you faced any biases on your journey, be it from yourself or others?
Aside from the biases shared above ‚Äì around preconceived notions of what a startup founder should be ‚Äì I‚Äôve also faced bias as a female entrepreneur. As a female founder, there‚Äôs more doubt about the numbers you present. When you‚Äôre presenting your business plan, male founders would be asked things like, ‚ÄúOK, so how much funding do you need to do that?‚Äù Females more often get asked, ‚ÄúCan you actually do that?‚Äù There‚Äôs a lot of unconscious bias in that skepticism.
Also, female founders are perceived to be less aggressive about their goals as male founders. I‚Äôve found that when I go into a meeting and I act ‚Äúaggressive,‚Äù just being super no filter, super confident, telling investors that they‚Äôre wrong ‚Äì it‚Äôs been more effective. But then sometimes, you get called out and told that you‚Äôre too bitchy ‚Äì you really can‚Äôt catch a break.
There‚Äôs also an added layer of bias being an impact entrepreneur. I asked an investor recently about what their value add was, and they got mad. Isn‚Äôt that a basic question I can ask about what you‚Äôre bringing to the table? As an impact startup founder, people immediately assume your business isn‚Äôt doing well and expect you to not be selective about funders.
There‚Äôs an unconscious bias when you‚Äôre female. There‚Äôs another layer of unconscious bias when you‚Äôre an impact entrepreneur. I experience double that bias.
Has being a female founder made a difference to your entrepreneurial journey? How so?
I think in terms of leadership, it has been very helpful in guiding and empowering the women in our team. We all face the same challenges like imposter syndrome in overcoming challenges in our personal and work lives.

Additionally, it‚Äôs also helped me be able to understand the unique problems of our customers and develop products that can benefit them. For example, one of the top reasons for dropping out of school in the Philippines is teenage pregnancy. We get a lot of single mothers applying for our financing program because they had to drop out when they got pregnant. They‚Äôve had to work full-time, and now they want to go back to school and upskill so that they can have income progression.
Being a female founder, I know how difficult that situation can be, and I understand that there are so many misconceptions about being a single mother, having previously dropped out, or having a kid, and being seen as unbankable. This has allowed me to design customer-centric products to meet their needs.
What‚Äôs been the most rewarding part of being a female founder?
Being able to inspire fellow female founders and aspiring female founders and allowing founders to see that it is possible to really grow a company, to really start something and pursue a unique vision. It‚Äôs no longer just about my mission at my startup ‚Äì I think that‚Äôs the best part ‚Äì it‚Äôs about representation, it‚Äôs about seeing more women entrepreneurs and more visibility ‚Äì being a role model.
What do you think needs to be done to drive more female entrepreneurship in Southeast Asia?
I think there needs to be holistic support. It‚Äôs not just funding; it‚Äôs mentorship, it‚Äôs emotional support. We need a greater quality of training and mentorship that‚Äôs available to female founders, and investors who really understand and support women entrepreneurs, who understand the unique barriers we face and aren‚Äôt in it just because it‚Äôs a ‚Äúsexy‚Äù thing to do.
What is the future you hope to see for female entrepreneurship in Southeast Asia?
That female entrepreneurs have no barriers to success. And that should be the case, right? It doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôll succeed, but the barriers they face should be equal to all the other people‚Äôs barriers, if they exist at all.

736802,2022-03-10T01:55:21,Why Alibaba should spin off Lazada,"With additional analysis by Simon Huang and reporting by Tay Tian Wen
A day before Alibaba released its latest earnings on February 24, a Bloomberg report suggested that the Chinese ecommerce giant had to shelve talks with investors to raise US$1 billion in a pre-IPO round for Lazada. The report cited a disagreement over the Southeast Asian firm‚Äôs valuation.

The potential spinoff of Lazada from Alibaba shouldn‚Äôt come as a surprise.
There have been some indications that Alibaba wants to empower its ‚Äúmini-CEOs‚Äù to cope with rising competition, according to the Wall Street Journal. The paper notes that Alibaba‚Äôs overseas ecommerce platforms ‚Äì Lazada and Trendyol ‚Äì could be among the units that are ‚Äúripe for spinoffs in the future.‚Äù
For its December 2021 quarter, Alibaba posted its slowest revenue growth since going public in 2014. Its stock price has been reeling from the ongoing tech crackdown in China.
Lazada, despite being overtaken by Shopee in Southeast Asia, might hold the key to unlocking the Chinese group‚Äôs future growth prospects ‚Äì but only if it can stand alone.


Higher expectations for Lazada?
Lazada is celebrating its 10th anniversary this month, and half of those 10 years have been under Alibaba. The story of how Lazada has been surpassed by Shopee in Southeast Asia has been well-covered.

Following the 2016 acquisition, culture conflicts and frequent top executive changes contributed to Lazada‚Äôs slowed momentum. But efforts have been made to correct that.
In late 2021, Alibaba appointed Jiang Fan to lead its new international digital commerce division that includes Lazada, Alibaba.com, and AliExpress. He was previously in charge of the Taobao and Tmall divisions, two of Alibaba‚Äôs most successful ventures.
Before Jiang officially took the helm on January 1 this year, Alibaba‚Äôs overseas businesses were ‚Äúscattered,‚Äù according to Chinese media reports.

Tech in Asia previously calculated that Alibaba injected about US$4.4 billion into Lazada between 2018 and 2020. A significant sum, but it trailed behind Shopee‚Äôs US$6.6 billion warchest in the same period.
That injection was also before China‚Äôs nationwide tech crackdown, which hit Alibaba the hardest. In recent quarters, the need to rely on overseas growth has become more obvious.
Last December, Alibaba revealed some important numbers for its Southeast Asian ecommerce business for the first time. The Hangzhou-headquartered¬†company said that its operations in the region clocked in US$21 billion in gross merchandise value (GMV) during the one-year period ending September 2021.
At the same time, Lazada Group CEO Chun Li has committed to boost the company‚Äôs GMV from US$21 billion to US$100 billion. However, he didn‚Äôt specify a timeframe for this fivefold growth.
A potential boost to valuation
In the latest earnings call, Alibaba chairman and CEO Daniel Zhang reiterated that ‚Äúthe market has not placed sufficient value on Alibaba‚Äôs business in terms of how it‚Äôs being driven by a multi-engine strategy.‚Äù
At its peak market value in October 2020, Alibaba was valued at around US$840 billion, or about 12x its revenue for 2020. Since then, the company has lost over US$560 billion in market value, according to Tech in Asia‚Äôs calculations. Currently, it is trading at a market value to revenue multiple of just 2.1x, far lower than its Southeast Asian counterparts.

Investors are likely to assign a higher multiple to a separately-traded Lazada entity, since ecommerce in Southeast Asia is growing at a faster rate than in China. Alibaba‚Äôs most recent results for the quarter ended December 31, 2021 revealed that Lazada saw year-on-year order growth of 52%. Both Taobao and Tmall only saw single-digit increases in the same period.
The regulatory environment in Southeast Asia toward big tech companies is also more benign than in China.
Lazada should attract a valuation higher than 2.1 times revenue ‚Äì a multiple equivalent to Sea‚Äôs 6.1x would unlock significant value for Alibaba and its shareholders.
It should be noted that Trendyol, Alibaba‚Äôs Turkey-based ecommerce arm, also reportedly has plans to go public as soon as this year, though this was before the current Russia-Ukraine conflict broke out.

Alibaba has about US$80 billion of cash and cash equivalents, which is around 10x of what Sea has, and it hasn‚Äôt done much fundraising. With a more nimble management team, could it now deploy more capital at greater speed and efficiency?
Rui Ma, founder of the Tech Buzz China podcast and an expert on Chinese tech, agrees that one of the benefits of spinoffs is faster capital deployment.
‚ÄúI think spinoffs in general are a common tactic for Chinese companies,‚Äù she adds. ‚ÄúSpinoffs can potentially accomplish many things, allowing for business-specific fundraising and dilution and different segments to be valued more exactly.‚Äù
She cites the case of JD as being the most successful in that sense, with both of its subsidiaries ‚Äì JD Health and JD Logistics ‚Äì making public debuts in Hong Kong in 2020.
But uncertainties abound
At home, Alibaba‚Äôs regulatory woes have seen no end in sight, with signs pointing toward potential new laws to tighten the grip on China‚Äôs tech sector.
The war in Ukraine is also adding more uncertainties for Alibaba as it is expected to affect AliExpress Russia, which was Russia‚Äôs most visited marketplace in 2021. Analysts are already noting¬†how the Chinese group is ‚Äúwalking a tightrope between Russia and Ukraine.‚Äù
That, however, can also mean that Southeast Asia is a safer bet for Alibaba.

‚ÄúCapital has dried up for China tech stocks in traditional Hong Kong and US markets. Alibaba might want to unlock value from business units in Southeast Asia and tap on alternative funding sources such as Singapore‚Äôs new SPAC listing framework,‚Äù Jason Yap, an independent analyst on Smartkarma, told Tech in Asia. ‚ÄúLazada is a familiar enough name that can attract regional investors in Southeast Asia.‚Äù
Yap‚Äôs base case is that by 2025, Lazada could be contributing US$626 million to Alibaba‚Äôs operating earnings. His key assumptions are set out below.

Assuming a market value to revenue ratio of 6.1x, Lazada might be valued at nearly US$21 billion if these projections pan out. Tech in Asia understands that the company was valued at around US$4.3 billion a couple of years ago and could be worth around US$9 billion currently. Another doubling in the next three years seems reasonable.

Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam ‚Äì September 27, 2018: Grab driver on the streets of Ho Chi Minh City, otherwise known as Saigon

The company will raise prices of its GrabCar services in Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi by 2,000 Vietnamese dong (US$0.088). Currently, GrabCar charges US$1.27 for the first two kilometers in four-seater vehicles, and US$1.49 for seven-seater vehicles. After that, the service costs US$0.022 per additional kilometer.
In other cities, GrabCar will hike the fare for the first two kilometers by between US$0.088 and US$0.11, while the fare for each additional kilometer will be hiked by US$0.026.
The increase in fares comes amid a rise in fuel prices in Vietnam. Petrol prices hit a new record of nearly US$1.18 per liter last week after authorities raised them for the sixth time in a row.
Meanwhile, fares for the company‚Äôs GrabBike services will be raised by US$0.55 to US$0.59. Each additional kilometer will be charged at US$0.19.

Hello reader,
Mythology has captured the imagination of millions since the dawn of human civilization. Classic Greek and Norse tales passed down through generations are probably the best known globally, but every culture in every country has its own unique folklore.
Yet, mythologies rarely ever share the same characters. You‚Äôd never see Thor, a popular Norse god, feature in the battle between the Titans and the Olympians ‚Äì a series of battles that shaped Greek mythology ‚Äì and this piques my creative interest.
The thought of powerful characters from different mythologies brawling on the big screen (or gaming universe) would probably send fans of mythology around the world into pandemonium. However, given how complex and sensitive these mythologies can be, such crossovers have rarely been attempted.
But our premium story pick today draws the battle lines in something akin to a modern-day, cross-cultural mythological tussle: the race between the tech titans of two major economic powers of the world.
Tech in Asia not only digs into the difference between India‚Äôs and China‚Äôs tech behemoths, but also explores the underlying factors behind the gap between the countries‚Äô respective tech ecosystems.
Today we look at:


How India‚Äôs tech titans stack up against Chinese peers

Not a level playing field

Image credit: Timmy Loen

There are more than 60,000 startups based in India currently ‚Äì significantly higher than the 500 startups it had in 2017. Last year, the country also welcomed 42 new unicorns and has been minting new unicorns almost as quickly as China. Yet, there remains a gulf between the startup ecosystems of the two neighbors.
From regulatory constraints to slow-growing legacy businesses, there are many hurdles that India‚Äôs tech firms have jump over to catch up with their Chinese counterparts.


Key differences: India sets itself apart from China in two ways: a leaderboard dominated by stalwart tech spinoffs and a late boom in significantly smaller unicorns. Large spinoffs like Tata Consulting and Tech Mahindra have been slow to pivot away from low-value legacy businesses that scale linearly, while India‚Äôs public sector also appears to trail China‚Äôs in supporting startups.


Turning point?: The good news is that India has already doubled down on backing its startups. Last month, the government allocated US$37.8 million to the flagship Startup India Seed Fund Scheme. Unlike many past initiatives that targeted specific demographics or industries, the country‚Äôs latest slew of support schemes for startups are founder and sector agnostic.


In a different league: The combined valuation of the top 10 Chinese tech firms is over fourfold that of their Indian peers. The contrast is even more stark when we look at the fifth to tenth largest Indian tech companies. Here, Chinese tech companies‚Äô combined valuation is more than sevenfold that of their Indian counterparts.

No need to save up for gas: The startup‚Äôs platform can process 9,000 transactions per second with zero gas fees. It currently counts prominent companies such as GameStop, TikTok, OpenSea, and VeeFriends as its clients. Immutable also develops and publishes NFT games such as Gods Unchained and Guild of Guardians.


New joinees: The startup also named four new C-level hires: Airtree Ventures partner Gill Findlay as COO, former IfOnly CEO John Boris as chief growth officer, former Riot Games executive Justin Hulog as chief studio officer, and former Culture Amp executive Katherine Rau as chief people officer.


Sight set on growth: Immutable aims to use the fresh funds to expand globally, further develop Immutable X, scale its gaming arm, tap new verticals, and explore M&amp;A opportunities. It also plans to hire 200 new employees over the next 12 months, adding to its current headcount of 165.



The female founders of Southeast Asia

What‚Äôs it like being a female founder in Southeast Asia? What are the challenges they face in running and growing their businesses? What do they think needs to be done to step up entrepreneurship among women in the region?
In honor of International Women‚Äôs Day this week, we here at Tech in Asia present to you the answers to these questions.

736718,2022-03-09T07:30:01,Reflections of a female founder-turned-VC,"Growing up, I was taught that self-reliance is the ultimate mark of success.
My father dropped out of high school to start working in his late teens and became a business owner in his late twenties ‚Äì around the time I was born. My mother graduated high school and had a stint as a tutor before spending the better part of her twenties and thirties as a stay-at-home mom.

Photo credit: Pikisuperstar

Both my parents came from large families with seven siblings each and grew up in a small town in Sumatra in the 1950s and 1960s, when schooling was basic and opportunities were limited. Most of my uncles became small-business owners themselves, and the women of my mother‚Äôs generation, by and large, either worked alongside their husbands or were full-time homemakers.
As the oldest of four children, I was the first in my family to complete a university degree. My siblings have since eclipsed me in their academic achievements, but I remember thinking on my first day at Yale that my life‚Äôs trajectory was about to diverge from what my parents experienced. A university degree opened up a world of possibilities for me, and I wanted my fellow Indonesians to experience the same.
It would be another 15 years before the idea for ErudiFi (the startup I co-founded) came to be, but unbeknownst to me, the seed of entrepreneurship had already been planted. Today, ErudiFi is enabling students in Indonesia and the Philippines to pursue higher education and is backed by investors such as Y Combinator, Monk‚Äôs Hill Ventures, Qualgro Ventures, Patamar Capital, Intudo Ventures, and AC Ventures.
Not many women are as lucky as I was to have turned a desire into a reality. It‚Äôs the year 2022 and yet only 2% of last year‚Äôs record-breaking US$330 billion in VC funds went to all-female founding teams. Dig a little deeper and a range of thought-provoking statistics surface. A 2018 study by Boston Consulting Group showed that businesses helmed by women deliver higher revenues than those founded by men, returning more than twice as much per dollar invested.
While every entrepreneurial journey is challenging in its own right, there is compelling evidence that women can do just as well if not better than men in this arena. Moreover, women represent a significant half of the consumer base and play a critical role in driving innovation in areas such as femtech, a US$40 billion opportunity in 2020 that is projected to reach US$75.1 billion by 2025.
So why don‚Äôt we see more female tech founders?
One might argue that there‚Äôs an implicit bias in the investment process that often leaves strong women-led businesses bereft of adequate funding. After all, tech has largely been seen as a male domain, and as archaic as that philosophy is, it is going to take some time to shake off that belief.
A lot has also been said about carving out a gender-balanced space in the VC universe, and yet the needle hasn‚Äôt moved much. Most conversations talk about the lack of female founders being a result of few limited partners backing female VCs, funds not offering women the same scope as men, and not enough female VCs being promoted to partnerships.
An article in the Harvard Business Review reports that since 1990, only 8% of VC investors in the US are women. This figure is not much more encouraging in emerging markets.
On the founder side, experiential studies point to evidence that pitches delivered by men are 60% more likely to receive funding than those presented by women ‚Äì even though the pitches may be indistinguishable. Of course, we need more data to conclude the root cause ‚Äì including whether this is indeed a result of systemic bias or a ‚Äútop-of-the-funnel‚Äù problem, with fewer female founders than male counterparts from the outset.
Regardless, the lived experience of many female founders suggests that these challenges are very real, albeit nuanced.
That said, not all women experience entrepreneurship the same way, just as not all men (or insert any other qualifier here) experience entrepreneurship the same way. Some have been extraordinarily successful, while others have found it more challenging, regardless of their gender.
Ultimately, I believe that the sum of our identity extends beyond any singular trait, be it gender, race, socioeconomic background, belief systems, and so on. However, as social creatures, women have had to grapple with self-limiting beliefs that are often perpetuated by our environment, both socially as well as in professional settings.
My own struggles stemmed from not having many role models at times when I needed guidance or someone to talk to.
I could fundraise or hire as effectively as my male co-founder, so my struggle was not as much with gender bias as it was to do with the stage of my life. When I became a mother, I looked around for those who had walked the founder-mother path, and I found very few.
In my fundraising experience, I never had the chance to pitch to a female VC partner and didn‚Äôt feel I could speak to any woman within the investment community about navigating parenthood and helming a startup.
Eventually, I did find one startup founder who was going through the same life-stage struggles as I was, but we truly do not have enough of those examples even today. The point here is not whether motherhood is compatible with being a founder, but rather that we need more women to model the different paths and possibilities in entrepreneurship.
To overcome this, I hope to see more role models and examples of successful women founders and senior women investors in the startup world, particularly in Southeast Asia. At Monk‚Äôs Hill Ventures (MHV), we support diversity across all our initiatives in programs such as Generation Girl, a nonprofit that aims to introduce women to STEM fields to help nurture the next generation of tech founders. We also track gender representation across all levels of our portfolio companies as part of our ESG efforts, which I lead.
Part of my motivation to become an investor at MHV was to pay it forward and be a resource to female founders in their journey, as well as connect founders with each other through introductions, founders‚Äô events, office hours, and more.
There has never been a better time to be a founder in Southeast Asia. Female founders should seek to build peer relationships within the startup community and find mentors ‚Äì male or female ‚Äì who can help them grow as individuals and as a company. These can be founders, senior operators, angels, advisors, and VC investors, ideally someone who has had similar experiences or knows the industry vertical well.
As a female founder and now a VC partner, I hope to see more senior women investors come to the fore to support the Southeast Asia tech ecosystem for all entrepreneurs. By enriching the diversity of perspectives and experiences, we can begin to rewrite the narrative for success to not only be inclusive but also provide better returns for all.",Susli Lie,Jaclyn Tiu and Arpit Nayak,0,"['Community', 'Opinion']",True,False,5

Hello there,
A gripe that I have with loyalty points, which are offered as a reward on so many different apps, is their lack of convenience in real-life situations. They‚Äôre often basically worthless outside the platform that issues them, and most expire before I can even get around to using them.
In a similar vein, what xSpend is doing for Axie Infinity token holders could be a game changer for the hundreds of thousands of Filipinos who play to earn on the blockchain-based game. The platform allows users to spend their smooth love potions (SLPs) ‚Äì Axie‚Äôs in-game currency ‚Äì on ordinary purchases such as mobile phone top-ups, electricity bills, or even flight tickets.
As it is, crypto users can swap their digital assets for fiat money by using centralized cryptocurrency exchanges. By using a service like xSpend, token holders can do transactions even without an exchanger wallet. And when it comes down to payments, a small convenience goes a long way. (You can read more of our coverage on Axie Infinity here.)

We explore how this aggregation service ties in with the budget carrier‚Äôs super-app ambitions in this week‚Äôs Hot Take.

THE HOT TAKEAirAsia‚Äôs latest take on financial services
Here‚Äôs what happened:

The Malaysian carrier recently rolled out financial marketplace AirAsia Money in Indonesia.
This is its second market after Malaysia, where it launched last year.
AirAsia Money aggregates various financial products such as insurance, investments, and money transfers.

Here‚Äôs our take:
For many, travel remains a relic of the pre-pandemic past. But assuming AirAsia used to be your airline of choice for budget flights, what are the chances that it could also be your destination for finding the best credit card, personal loan, or insurance plan in town?
AirAsia Money, the latest of a seemingly endless list of cards that AirAsia has up its sleeve, is a financial marketplace similar to comparison sites like MoneySmart, Seedly, SingSaver, and Finder (which acquired GoBear).
Financial comparison sites direct traffic to their partners ‚Äì which can range from commercial banks to insurance companies ‚Äì and generally earn fees from lead generation upon successful referrals. AirAsia Money says its revenue model will be a combination of commissions and revenue sharing.
In Indonesia, the platform offers general insurance through local startup PasarPolis, investments through wealth management app Bareksa, and remittances¬† via money transfers service Wise.
Breaking the Indonesia market ‚Äì where AirAsia Money will go up against players like Cermati and C88, which operates as CekAja ‚Äì will likely be tough.
For one, AirAsia Money faces structural hurdles. ‚ÄúMany banks have operationally intensive processes, like filling physical application forms that require a wet signature from the customer and manual evaluation,‚Äù Vinod Nair, CEO of Singapore-headquartered MoneySmart tells Tech in Asia. This limits the extent to which referrals can be made and completed digitally. (We previously covered MoneySmart‚Äôs pandemic recovery.)
‚ÄúWhile consumer demand for such products might be high, approval rates are poor because many Indonesians lack credit history. The referral fee or commission rates from the customers who do get approved are also relatively low compared to other markets,‚Äù Nair explains. The CEO would know: MoneySmart once operated in Indonesia but eventually sold its local business to LifePal, a Jakarta-based insurance marketplace.

AirAsia Money will get more partners on board as it expands. After all, the company has described the business model as being ‚Äúmodular‚Äù and scalable through collaboration with other fintech players. That puts AirAsia Money in line with other financial comparison sites, where it‚Äôs common for a platform to forge multiple partnerships per product type.
The platform plans to introduce unsecured products such as loans, credit cards, and game top-ups in the future, Mohamad Hafidz, chief fintech officer of AirAsia‚Äôs super app, tells Tech in Asia.
While the firm teamed up with comparison site RinggitPlus in Malaysia at its launch, it has since added partners such as Policystreet, a Kuala Lumpur-based insurance marketplace, to offer motor insurance.
AirAsia is certainly betting that user traffic on its main app ‚Äì amid and after the Covid-19 era ‚Äì will funnel down into its many complementary services such as banking, grocery delivery, and food delivery, which is scheduled to launch in Indonesia this year.
As far as AirAsia Money goes, that traffic could go both ways.
Financial comparison sites are in the business of drawing in traffic, whether through facilitating community reviews or creating personal finance content. It‚Äôs why financial institutions rely on these platforms to distribute their products. Some have even gone as far as to acquire such a site.
Going forward, AirAsia Money could even distribute the products of the airlines‚Äô other products, such as BigPay, a fintech firm run under the Capital A brand that offers money transfer and digital payments services. Last week, BigPay added personal loans to the mix and is being eyed as one of AirAsia Money‚Äôs unsecured product offerings, Hafidz says.
The company is also giving out flight vouchers for purchases of car insurance on AirAsia Money as well as loyalty points to users who pay their bills through the platform. ‚ÄúWe plan to always offer discounts for any purchases on AirAsia Money,‚Äù Hafidz adds.
That said, with the financial comparison space already saturated with players, AirAsia Money will need to set itself apart in the consumers‚Äô eyes to successfully draw traffic.
Launches in the Philippines and Thailand are in the works, though a firm date has not been fixed.

733440,2022-03-09T04:00:01,"QuickBytes: Breaking through barriers with Tessa Wijaya, Xendit‚Äôs COO","As part of Tech in Asia‚Äôs 2022 International Women‚Äôs Day campaign ‚ÄúBreak The Bias,‚Äù we conducted a survey of female founders in Southeast Asia to learn more about their experiences. We also sat down with some founders from the region to dive deeper into their stories. Here‚Äôs one of them.

Tessa Wijaya is the COO and co-founder of Indonesian payment gateway startup Xendit. In September last year, the company joined the unicorn club after raising US$150 million in series C funding.

In this interview, Wijaya shares how her entrepreneurial journey unfolded, the challenges she faced along the way, and her aspirations for the future of Southeast Asia‚Äôs female founders.
The following interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.
Did you always want to be an entrepreneur? How did you get started on this journey?
I‚Äôve always been fascinated by the idea of being an entrepreneur. There are a lot of people in my family who are entrepreneurs who ran small canteens and hawker stalls. I thought it was quite interesting and a much more exciting thing to do rather than going to work as a regular worker.
I did start a few side businesses before Xendit. I started a restaurant, which failed, and a batik brand with one of my closest friends, but we had to discontinue it to focus on our full-time jobs. I started a jewellery business as well with some friends, where I‚Äôm a silent partner right now. So when Xendit came around, I thought, ‚ÄúThis is the time to really take the plunge into the world of entrepreneurship, and while I‚Äôm at it, why not do something in tech?‚Äù
What are the best and worst things about being an entrepreneur?
The best thing would be having our hard work ‚Äì not just the founding team, but that of everybody at Xendit ‚Äì appreciated by the investors who have put their trust in us to allow us to expand to where we are now. When we first started out, we were extremely nervous and excited to process US$10,000. To process 100 transactions a day, we were like, ‚ÄúYes, we‚Äôre winning!‚Äù And now we process more than 150 million transactions per year to the tune of US$12 billion dollars a year. Looking at the company and what we‚Äôve built today ‚Äì that‚Äôs really one of the most exciting parts of the journey.

For the worst thing‚Ä¶ I wouldn‚Äôt say they were bad parts of the journey. I think it all comes as a package. Obviously, building something from scratch, all the things we have to go through, the growing pains ‚Äì everything from finding the right people to all the fires we‚Äôve had to face and having to get through so many hurdles in our lifetime as a startup ‚Äì that‚Äôs been tough.
What‚Äôs the biggest challenge you‚Äôve faced on your journey so far?
The most challenging aspect has been for me to scale as a manager, as a leader. I think what people often don‚Äôt realize is a startup with that much pressure to grow reinvents itself every six months, every year. They say when you hit 50 people you become a totally different company. 100, 500, 1,000 ‚Äì with each milestone, you become a whole different company. And for me, this is a first ‚Äì I‚Äôve never run a company before, I‚Äôve never even been a manager, I‚Äôve never built and run big operation teams before. There have been a lot of firsts, and it‚Äôs been extremely challenging to keep up as the company grows and changes.
Have you faced any biases on your journey, be it from yourself or others?
As a woman, whenever you want to jump into something new, people are going to be a lot more skeptical. What I realized is that for my male counterparts, whatever it is that they want to jump into, everyone‚Äôs like, ‚ÄúYeah, of course you can do it.‚Äù For me, I‚Äôve experienced a ton of ‚Äúnos‚Äù in my lifetime, and a lot of doubt gets sown in your mind.
I‚Äôve also been underestimated at times or not been taken seriously. There have been meetings where I say something, and I have to call in Moses, our CEO, and be like, ‚ÄúHey, can you say the same thing again?‚Äù And then people listen. There was also one incident when someone told me, ‚ÄúOh, you‚Äôre running operations, so you‚Äôre not a Sheryl Sandberg.‚Äù And I was a little insulted ‚Äì I may not be a commercial COO, I may not run the sales organization, but at the same time, I don‚Äôt think he would have told someone like Moses, ‚ÄúOh, you‚Äôre not a Mark Zuckerberg.‚Äù
These are the kinds of microaggressions you get as a female founder, but you have to just grow a thick skin and shrug them off.
Has being a female founder made a difference to your entrepreneurial journey? How so?
I‚Äôve found that what a woman can bring to the table is empathy. Empathy is underestimated, but it allows you to be able to understand the other side and get to the finish line, to get to that agreement.
Additionally, at Xendit, we‚Äôve built up a workforce that‚Äôs 45% women. Being a woman gives me a better perspective on the challenges that women face with staying in the workforce, which is something an all-male leadership team might not understand.

For example, one of the members of our finance team had left the workforce for a period of time in order to focus on her children, which is amazing. However, when she wanted to go back to work after that, she had difficulty getting hired despite having an incredibly strong resume. At the time, we were still very small, but I was like ‚ÄúHey, her resume is amazing, let‚Äôs get her in.‚Äù
We‚Äôve also rolled out some cool initiatives to support our staff working from home during the pandemic, such as by sending them food so that they don‚Äôt have to cook. For many women, working from home means they actually have two jobs ‚Äì their day job and the job of taking care of the house and family. So being a female founder allows me to understand that and put in policies that make a difference.
What‚Äôs been the most rewarding part of being a female founder?
What‚Äôs really rewarding has been being a manager to a team. As I‚Äôve shared, this is something that was really new and something that I‚Äôve never experienced before. I manage a lot of young women, and I‚Äôm extremely proud of how they‚Äôve grown.
Having that female perspective, I know what it‚Äôs like to be young, to be new to the workforce, to be fearful, to have lower self-esteem. Women are scared, women are doubtful about sitting at the table, and it‚Äôs been rewarding to have mentored a bunch of young women to push them to know their worth, to dare to speak up, to ask for a raise, to know that it‚Äôs not overstepping boundaries. If you‚Äôve got the skills, you should be able to ask for more, to be able to sit at that table. Mentoring in that way has been extremely rewarding for me.
I‚Äôve also been able to inspire and help develop young female tech talent in Indonesia through the Women in Tech Indonesia initiative.
What‚Äôs your advice for aspiring female founders?
You‚Äôre going to hear a lot of ‚Äùnos,‚Äù so you just need to get that one ‚Äùyes.‚Äù Just focus on that one ‚Äùyes,‚Äù and have that thick skin when you hear those ‚Äùnos.‚Äù Also, don‚Äôt be afraid to just reach out to people for advice or help ‚Äì you don‚Äôt have to do this alone.
Also, as a female founder, you may be underestimated. So make sure you‚Äôre the most prepared at the table. Nothing beats preparation, nothing beats having done your homework so you‚Äôre knowledgeable about a subject that you‚Äôre going to be sitting down having a meeting about. We‚Äôve all been there, we‚Äôve all experienced this doubt, this bias. Be prepared, and I think you‚Äôll do fine.
What is the future you hope to see for female entrepreneurship in Southeast Asia?
I would love to see more female founders in tech and especially more female CTOs. If you look at the statistics, even at Xendit itself, out of our 45% female workforce, most are still sitting on the business operations side ‚Äì there aren‚Äôt many at all on the engineering side. I‚Äôm proud to be the first female co-founder to bring a company to unicorn status in Indonesia. Maybe one day, there‚Äôll be the first female CEO and CTO, not just COO.

736086,2022-03-09T02:00:08,20 years in tech: how Infobip‚Äôs regional manager fell in love with the industry,"This article is part of ‚ÄúBreak the Bias,‚Äù Tech in Asia‚Äôs campaign for International Women‚Äôs Day 2022. Through this initiative, we‚Äôre shining the spotlight on the women who are breaking barriers and achieving success in Asia‚Äôs tech and startup ecosystem.

When Vivien Ang first entered the tech industry 20 years ago, she came from a different world.
As a fresh engineering graduate, Ang had initially begun her career as a quality assurance engineer. However, she soon realized that the industry was not her cup of tea and that she preferred a different working environment.
‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to talk to machines, and I‚Äôd rather talk to people instead,‚Äù she says.
That desire for human interaction eventually led her to a customer service role at a telecommunications firm in 2003. Little did Ang know, this would be the first step of a 20-year journey in tech.
Opening a new door
As someone who came from a non-tech background, Ang initially took on a customer service role because it gave her an opportunity to interact more with people. Because of this, she acknowledges that she had some initial misconceptions of what the tech world would be like.

Vivien Ang, regional manager for Asia Pacific at Infobip / Photo credit: Infobip

‚ÄúBack then, I knew nothing about tech,‚Äù Ang says. ‚ÄúAll I knew [about communication tech] was just telephones, the internet, and nothing else.‚Äù
It was through this role that Ang learned more about the various technologies and solutions used by telcos such as frame relays and satellite services, which opened her eyes to what tech could be like.
This, however, was just a small taste of the industry for Ang. The moment that kickstarted her interest in tech was when she was promoted to the role of global account manager in 2005.
In her new role, Ang often found herself selling solutions to large enterprises. Through this, Ang realized that tech wasn‚Äôt just limited to the communication solutions that she was used to seeing.
‚ÄúI got to know that beyond the communication [services] I was providing to them, there were also a lot of things backing those services up,‚Äù she shares, bringing up examples such as the IT network and the technology used to set up communication services. ‚ÄúThat was what really got me interested, knowing that there‚Äôs a lot more to tech.‚Äù
Ang set her sights on uncovering more about this new world, but it was also intimidating with all the jargon that she wasn‚Äôt familiar with. Fortunately, help came from a client who offered to guide Ang in her learning journey and teach her the basics.
Under the client‚Äôs guidance, Ang was able to learn more about the solutions she was selling and the underlying reasons behind why companies were seeking such technologies, giving her a wider look at what the industry was after. She also capitalized on her interactions with other clients to learn more about different solutions within the tech scene.
‚ÄúThat was when I decided that this is where I want to be, because it‚Äôs an industry that‚Äôs never going to fade away. It‚Äôs just going to keep developing with more and more technologies to come,‚Äù she says.
A continuous journey
Ang eventually left the telecommunications company in 2006 to pursue more opportunities in the industry and had the chance to work for other tech giants along the way.
While she‚Äôs happy with the progress she‚Äôs made in the last 20 years, she‚Äôs also acutely aware that it wasn‚Äôt all smooth sailing. One major hurdle that she‚Äôs had to overcome is the struggle between work commitments and the obligations she felt as a wife and daughter.
This comes as no surprise, as studies have shown that women are more likely to adjust their career paths for the sake of their families. But in the fast-paced world of tech, doing so meant she faced the risk of being left behind.
Because of the amount of specialized knowledge required in tech, spending time with her family could leave her with less time to research and keep up with the latest trends in her day-to-day work. In sales roles such as Ang‚Äôs, this could mean potentially losing out on a selling point, with clients moving on to competitors‚Äô solutions instead. Ang recalls how some work days would stretch up to 14 hours as she tried her best to close deals with prospective clients.

In this regard, striking the right balance is key. For Ang, that meant having the support of her family through open communication and letting them know about her busy periods at work. With such an arrangement in place, Ang was able to alleviate some of the pressures from familial obligations while still being able to keep pace in the workplace.
Today, Ang serves as the regional manager for Asia Pacific at global cloud communications platform Infobip, a role that she‚Äôs held since May 2020. Since joining the company, she‚Äôs helped to grow its Singapore sales team from scratch, starting with two members to six today. She has also secured more than 70 new customers for Infobip from the Asia Pacific region, including firms based in Singapore, Malaysia, and Vietnam.
Giving back
It‚Äôs been a long journey for Ang in the tech world, but it‚Äôs apparent that her love for the industry has not waned. The regional manager says that she often keeps herself up to date with the latest technology so that she can continue having meaningful conversations with clients.
‚ÄúI have a lot of friends who are very into tech, and I make it a point to catch up with them very often because they give me insights about what‚Äôs going on out there,‚Äù she shares. ‚ÄúHaving this knowledge helps me have conversations with my clients to let them know that it‚Äôs all about the technology and not about what I sell.‚Äù
But at this stage of her career, Ang highlights that all the work she‚Äôs put in and the knowledge she‚Äôs gained over the last two decades now serve an additional purpose: to help her give back and educate junior members of her team who are now in the same position she used to be in.
‚ÄúI believe in succession planning,‚Äù she explains. ‚ÄúI want to bring up the people in my team to the next level so that they can go beyond what they‚Äôre good at and guide them to break out of their comfort zone.‚Äù
As for the wider tech industry, Ang hopes to see more women in higher positions in the coming years, especially within more technical roles such as solutions architecture. In this regard, she points out that companies can also do their part by recognizing women‚Äôs achievements to spur more confidence in them.
‚ÄúI hope more women will take up technical architecture roles where they can be pivotal in helping companies design solutions. That‚Äôs something I would really love to see in the next couple of years,‚Äù she says.

However, that‚Äôs changing. A platform called xSpend, which launched in December 2021, is letting players directly use Axie Infinity tokens (and other cryptocurrencies) to pay for goods and services.
‚ÄúI can use on average 5,000 SLPs (smooth love potions) monthly ‚Äì at a rate of 1.5 to 3 Philippine pesos ‚Äì for services such as mobile phone credits and paying electricity bills,‚Äù CryptoMahalay, a Philippines-based Axie Infinity manager, tells Tech in Asia.
Of course, that rate has since dropped. SLP, which is the in-game currency players earn to play Axie Infinity, is also prone to price fluctuations ‚Äì its price currently hovers below US$0.02 apiece, compared with US$0.23 in July 2021.

That said, behavior trends appear to be on xSpend‚Äôs side. Valeri Inting, chairman and CEO of XLD Tech Labs, a key partner of the company behind xSpend, says the platform had 7,500 new users within a week of its launch. She also points out that 77% of the members of crypto gaming guild Yield Guild Games (YGG) currently use their tokens to pay for real-life necessities or monthly bills.
‚ÄúThis is different from people‚Äôs traditional conception that crypto involvement simply means HODLing tokens and waiting for price appreciation,‚Äù she explains.
Ambitions for financial inclusion
Axie Infinity players mainly earn money by winning in-game battles between digital monsters called Axies.
To use SLPs for daily necessities, players would need to convert them to fiat money through the usual cryptocurrency exchanges. However, xSpend allows players to connect their crypto wallets to its platform, and choose to pay for services with SLPs or other cryptocurrencies.
Apart from SLPs, xSpend also accepts other tokens such as USDT, USDC, DAI, BNB, and YGG.
For instance, Juvar Abrera, a co-manager of an Axie Infinity team uses USDC to pay for his internet bills and GrabPay wallet via xSpend.
‚ÄúSome of my money [is] in crypto and sometimes I don‚Äôt want to use the money on my bank account,‚Äù Abrera tells Tech in Asia. But he says it‚Äôs different with xSpend: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need to cash out my crypto from centralized exchanges like Binance.‚Äù
Each conversion from cryptocurrency to fiat currency and every withdrawal from an exchange to a bank account involves paying fees.
This means users might save on fees by using xSpend and find it easier to spend their cryptocurrency.

Besides paying for phone credits and settling utility bills, xSpend users in the Philippines have also used the platform for charity donations and paying for insurance, education, credit card bills, and even flight tickets.
Meanwhile, in Indonesia, Malaysia, India, and Bangladesh, only prepaid phone credits are available on xSpend‚Äôs platform for now, but XLD Tech Labs‚Äô Inting says xSpend plans to launch globally in 2022.
‚Äã‚ÄãWhile users pay with SLPs and other cryptocurrencies, merchants receive fiat money, explains Inting. She adds that the company maintains pools of both fiat and cryptocurrency on the back end.
‚ÄúWe transact with a user directly with SLP, [but] we pay merchants in fiat,‚Äù Inting explains. ‚ÄúAnd the SLP will not return to the Axie Infinity treasury.‚Äù
There are multiple reasons XLD Finance, the company behind xSpend, started with the Philippines. For one, XLD‚Äôs founders are Filipino, and at the same time, a large chunk of Axie Infinity‚Äôs players are based in the Philippines.
About 35% of traffic to Axie Infinity ‚Äì and its biggest share of its 2.5 million daily active users ‚Äì comes from the Philippines, according to the game‚Äôs Vietnam-based developer, Sky Mavis.
‚ÄúFilipinos play Axie Infinity the most because they can speak English. That explains the rapid adoption rate,‚Äù adds Irene Umar, co-founder of YGG SEA. ‚ÄúIn Indonesia, the game needs to be translated first into Indonesian so that they can understand.‚Äù
Another consideration for xSpend was the population of unbanked Filipinos. About 36.9 million Filipinos ‚Äì or 48% of the country‚Äôs adult population ‚Äì do not have a bank account, according to data from the country‚Äôs central bank.
Platforms like xSpend could indeed help improve financial inclusion ‚Äì a core vision for XLD Finance. Crypto wallets, in essence, could become a sort of replacement for bank accounts.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very different from your typical conception of all people are in crypto: they want to hold onto assets and then get rich to the moon,‚Äù Inting says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not really the case [here]. Regardless of the SLP price, they have to cash out, because about 85% of them are coming from households that earn less than US$400 a month.‚Äù
YGG SEA‚Äôs Umar points out that even for people already in the banking system, the know-your-customer (KYC) process of signing up to use a crypto exchange is already a hassle.
‚ÄúWhat XLD does is to make it easier for people without an exchanger wallet to transact,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúPlus, the tokens do not have to leave the wallet until you need it.‚Äù
Indeed, Inting quotes data from Sky Mavis that estimates that 25% of all Axie Infinity users count their Ronin wallet as their first introduction to financial services.
‚ÄúIf you really think about it, the reason why DeFi (decentralized finance) and Web3 are taking off is because 1.1 billion people in the world can‚Äôt prove who they are,‚Äù Umar explains. Echoing Umar, Inting says these people can‚Äôt go through the typical bank KYC systems because there are ‚Äú100 people sharing one address and informal settler communities in the Philippines‚Äù with no permanent address.
‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt prove who you are, you can‚Äôt sign up for a Binance or centralized exchange account,‚Äù Inting adds.
Finally, if more services accept SLP and other crypto gaming tokens as payment, more people would hold the currency, which could keep its inflationary tendencies in check. This, in turn,would make the GameFi economy more self-sustainable.
Regulations a barrier?
Abrera, the co-manager of an Axie Infinity team, finds that in the Philippines, cryptocurrency adoption continues to be a niche proposition mostly because so few retail businesses currently accept cryptocurrency as a means of payment.
‚ÄúIf more businesses would accept crypto, more people would spend their crypto,‚Äù Abrera explains. ‚ÄúI guess it‚Äôs a matter of time when the government will fully regulate crypto or accept Bitcoin as legal tender like what they did in El Salvador.‚Äù
Regulation is indeed a potential stumbling block. In India ‚Äì where xSpend is also present ‚Äì more people are using bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies to pay for certain goods or services. But local regulators have taken notice ‚Äì the government has said it prefers to classify cryptocurrency as an asset, similar to gold.
Taufik Kurniawan Hermanda, chief operating officer at cryptocurrency exchange platform Tokocrypto, points out that Indonesia also still regulates crypto as a commodity, and not a currency. In keeping with that view, the country‚Äôs supervising body for cryptocurrency trading is the commodity futures regulatory agency, not Bank Indonesia or the financial services authority.
‚ÄúCrypto assets are still prohibited as a means of payment, but as an investment tool they can be included as commodities that can be traded on futures exchanges,‚Äù explains Harmanda.

Still, YGG SEA‚Äôs Umar is confident that cryptocurrency for payments will become a reality in Indonesia ‚Äì whatever the government‚Äôs current stance is.
‚ÄúWhether the government is ready or not, it‚Äôs going to come and it‚Äôs going to happen,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúEither way, we will always be here to support the government. That‚Äôs my commitment.‚Äù
Regulations aside, the more pressing task is to educate users, who are often new to the financial system. Umar says that YGG SEA advises scholars to stake their AXS tokens ‚Äì which are the higher priced of Axie Infinity‚Äôs two tokens ‚Äì to earn interest, as opposed to converting everything to fiat without a strong reason.
It‚Äôs also important to be conscious of the ups and downs in cryptocurrency prices.
‚ÄúSLPs are going down at the moment, but I tell them not to use high prices as the benchmark,‚Äù Umar explains. ‚ÄúRemember that before this, you wouldn‚Äôt earn anything from playing a game.‚Äù
The Philippines is hardly the only Southeast Asian country with a large unbanked or underbanked population. Umar, for one, thinks that an expansion of xSpend‚Äôs services in Indonesia is only a matter of time. She adds that YGG, which is an investor in XLD Finance, is currently helping the latter find a venture partner in the country.
As for XLD, xSpend is just the start. Inting says its roadmap includes products like early wage access, lending, a DeFi wallet, and a stablecoin-staking mechanism.
‚ÄúWhat this really represents is millions of new users coming online for the first time and being able to use financial services,‚Äù she explains. ‚ÄúImagine earning half the country‚Äôs minimum wage just playing Axie Infinity. Why is it that I can‚Äôt take up a loan or solve my cash flow issues by going to a bank and saying, ‚Äòplease accept my SLP as collateral?‚Äô‚Äù",Jofie Yordan,Putra Muskita and Arpit Nayak,0,"['Blockchain', 'Fintech', 'Gaming', 'Premium Content']",True,True,7

736488,2022-03-09T00:00:39,Japanese üõ∞Ô∏è startup beams up $2.7m in seed funding,"ElevationSpace, a Japan-based spacetech startup, has raised US$2.7 million in seed funding from Genesia Ventures, Plug and Play Japan, and Tohoku University Venture Partners, among others.
Including its pre-seed funding, the company has raised a total of about US$3 million to date.

As part of the round, Genesia Ventures partner Masafumi Kawai¬†will join ElevationSpace‚Äôs board as a director.
Originating from Tohoku University in Japan, ElevationSpace is developing a space environment utilization and recovery satellite to replace the International Space Station (ISS). It has developed more than 10 small satellites and is developing a unit called ElevationSpace-Recovery (ELS-R), which can conduct space experiments, tests, and manufacturing inside the satellite.
The company says that its ELS-R satellites are much cheaper and easier to use than the ISS because its service doesn‚Äôt require crew members and is smaller. Its satellites also allow for more frequent launches compared to the ISS, so users can easily conduct material manufacturing, tests, and experiments in space..
ElevationSpace‚Äôs first launch of the ELS-R satellite is planned for 2023 and will use atmospheric reentry technology. The next launch will be the ELS-R1000, a service-providing satellite weighing around 1,000 kilograms, which is scheduled for 2026. The company is aiming for six launches per year by 2030.

‚ÄúDeveloping countries like Asian countries don‚Äôt have enough opportunities to use the ISS while their economies are growing rapidly and space development is gaining momentum. We believe it is necessary to provide opportunities to conduct experiments and demonstrate technologies in space in such regions,‚Äù says Ryohei Kobayashi, co-founder and CEO of ElevationSpace.
‚ÄúThe space environment utilization platform developed by ElevationSpace will enable inexpensive and convenient experiments and manufacturing in microgravity. Those things will accelerate the development of new high-performance materials and drugs that could not be created on Earth before,‚Äù added Kawai.
The spacetech startup was founded in February 2021 by Kobayashi and aerospace engineer Toshinori Kuwahara, who serves as its CTO.

When crypto influencing goes bad

Image credit: Timmy Loen

If you‚Äôre on social media these days, there‚Äôs no lack of content around cryptocurrency trading and other related fields such as NFTs. In Singapore, it‚Äôs pretty common to see social media influencers talking about digital coins and the like, which has led to some legal and ethical concerns.


The Crypto King: An example of this in action is the story of Ryan Tan, co-founder of Night Owl Cinematics, a YouTube channel and production firm known for its lifestyle and comedy videos. In late 2021, Tan started posting about crypto on his Instagram stories, talking about his two-week foray into NFTs and play-to-earn (P2E) games. He also shared a link to help his followers set up accounts on the popular Metamask crypto wallet as well as two centralized crypto exchanges and created Telegram groups for followers to get into crypto under his guidance.


Not an expert: In the time since Tan first invited followers to invest their money into the two P2E games he promoted, both tokens have crashed, and Tan has not posted about them or made appearances in the crypto-related Telegram channels he runs. When he was confronted about his actions earlier in the year after the first crash, Tan maintained that any losses were not his fault and that he had only shared his own thoughts and opinions on these games.


The power of an influencer: Experts have a different take on the situation. Many believe crypto influencers should have relevant experience in the sector before even promoting anything, and some law experts say Tan could be liable for the losses experienced by his followers because of his actions.

735806,2022-03-08T08:00:23,The entrepreneurial experience of SEA‚Äôs female founders,"
Southeast Asia‚Äôs potential ‚Äì and success ‚Äì as a startup ecosystem is well-documented. There‚Äôs no doubt that founders from the region are capable of building thriving businesses that can compete on the global stage.
However, even as Southeast Asia‚Äôs startup scene matures, it still has some work to do. For instance, there‚Äôs a stark gender imbalance among the founders of its rising startups. According to Tech in Asia data, only seven out of the region‚Äôs 80 top-funded startups have a woman in their founding teams, even though women make up 42% of the workforce¬†and half of the population.¬†
Women founders have also reported challenges with accessing funding and markets¬†as well as contending with¬†long-standing biases about their capabilities and strengths.¬†
Nevertheless, it‚Äôs an exciting time to be a founder in Southeast Asia, especially for female founders, who are carving out new paths for themselves.¬†
As part of our 2022 International Women‚Äôs Day campaign, Tech in Asia¬†decided to explore the experiences of the region‚Äôs female founders by conducting a qualitative survey.
To understand their lived experiences, we went beyond the numbers and gathered insights from the anecdotes they shared. We then analyzed their responses and sorted them thematically, identifying common themes that emerged from the stories of these founders.
We received nearly 60 responses for our survey and interviewed seven founders to gain a deeper perspective.
While this survey is not representative of all female founders in Southeast Asia, we hope it offers a snapshot of their journeys and gives a closer look into what it means to be a woman in the region‚Äôs tech and startup ecosystem. Starting up isn‚Äôt easy, but anything worth doing is well worth the effort.
Survey and interview responses have been edited for brevity and clarity.
¬†

Entrepreneurship is often described as being a rollercoaster¬† ‚Äì with good reason. Regardless of race, gender, industry, or geography, founders will agree: There are plenty of highs and just as many lows. We asked our survey respondents what they thought were the best and hardest aspects of the startup founder life, and we captured a breadth of experiences.¬†
Five key themes emerged around the best part of being a founder: innovation, freedom, impact, inspiration, and passion.¬†
Ôªø
A majority of our respondents cited how satisfying it was to innovate and create, while some expressed how much they enjoy the freedom that comes with being an entrepreneur. For others, making an impact, sparking inspiration, or pursuing their passion via their startups is what they like the most about being a founder.¬†
There were a handful of responses that didn‚Äôt fall within these five categories, such as how entrepreneurship allows them to embark on a journey of learning or be different from the crowd.¬†
ÔªøÔªø
But of course, starting up isn‚Äôt all roses. When our respondents were asked about the hardest part of their entrepreneurial journeys, over a quarter of them talked about how work can get overwhelming and the negative effects of such a burden. They also mentioned the loneliness, self-doubt, fear, pressure, and volatility that come with taking this path.¬†
Ôªø
Other responses discussed the complications of scaling a business, people issues, and dealing with VCs.¬†

¬†

Running your own business is hard, but some parts of it are much harder than others, especially for women entrepreneurs.¬†
‚ÄúEvery entrepreneurial journey is unique, regardless of whether you are a female or a male founder. Women, however, may experience these challenges in different ways than men,‚Äù says Susli Lie, partner at Monk‚Äôs Hill Ventures and co-founder of education finance firm ErudiFi. ‚ÄúThe lived experience of many women I have spoken to suggests that these challenges are very real, albeit nuanced. Some of these challenges are a result of self-limiting beliefs and often perpetuated by our society, both socially as well as in professional settings.‚Äù 
Broadly speaking, the most common stumbling blocks standing in the way of our survey participants were talent, leadership, bias and doubt, and funding.¬†
Talent
Like any entrepreneur in any industry, our respondents grapple with bringing in people with the right skills and mindsets, given the constraints over money and resources. Over 33.3% of female founders named talent as the most significant challenge they‚Äôve encountered so far.

Leadership
Roughly 17.5% of the founders we surveyed cited leadership-related struggles as their greatest challenge. Most are going at it for the first time and find they have to steer a company towards success while juggling everyday responsibilities.¬†
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs so many things happening at all times, and trying to really keep a clear head with everything that‚Äôs going on can be super difficult, since there‚Äôs so many other things that you need [to do] to manage this company as well,‚Äù shares Jane von Rabenau, CEO at Indonesian retail startup Siklus. 
Bias and doubt
About 17.5% of the respondents said that apart from bias, they also deal with doubt stemming from internal battles ‚Äì feeling imposter syndrome or second-guessing one‚Äôs decisions ‚Äì and external sources, such as investors, potential customers, and even family and friends.¬†
Bias is a typical hurdle for female founders in Southeast Asia ‚Äì an issue that we‚Äôll delve into later in this piece.¬†

Funding
Over 14% of our survey participants discussed the difficulty of securing funds. This corresponds with larger trends observed in the industry: Women-led firms raised just 16.5% of the US$8.6 billion that went into Southeast Asian startups in 2020, and funding into women-led startups also dropped globally¬†between 2019 and 2020.¬†
There are several reasons why female founders don‚Äôt raise as much funding as their male peers.¬†
Some respondents noted that female founders tend to be more risk-averse and more conservative with their numbers. While this cautiousness has helped them build and lead profitable, sustainable businesses, it can work against them during pitches with investors, who are typically focused on growth. Meanwhile, others cited biases against women founders and problems with forging the connections required to get their foot in the door.¬†
¬†

Over 77% of our respondents felt that being female has made a difference in their entrepreneurial journeys. They regard it as a positive element, particularly crediting how women can tap into empathy¬†to produce results and propel their companies to success.¬†
‚ÄúIt allows you to ‚Äã‚Äãbe able to understand the other side and get to the finish line, get to that agreement,‚Äù says Xendit‚Äôs Wijaya.¬†
Empathic leadership also influences how female founders approach other aspects of running a startup, such as hiring and managing teams.¬†

‚ÄúWomen can bring a different perspective to the workplace, thus adding a diversity of opinion and representation,‚Äù adds Monk‚Äôs Hill Ventures‚Äô Lie.¬†
Other respondents identified positive differences such as the sense of community that comes from being a female founder and opportunities like women-focused accelerators or incubator programs.¬†
On the flip side are some negative elements such as biases against female founders. Of the respondents who said that being a woman made a difference, over 36% said that they were underestimated and had trouble making their voices heard and getting their foot in the door. Meanwhile, approximately 13% shared that it made fundraising harder.¬†
Other negative differences included feeling a greater penalty for prioritizing work over their personal lives and wrestling with more doubt than their male peers.
¬†


Nearly 72% of the female founders we surveyed said they have encountered some form of bias on their entrepreneurial journeys. This was not limited to gender ‚Äì they also pinpointed biases around age, education, and the industries they were operating in.¬†
Ôªø
Founders also reported being seen as too old or too young to be in business, faced skepticism about their education or work background, and misconceptions about the markets and industries they operate. These biases don‚Äôt exist in isolation, and they‚Äôre often compounded on a founder‚Äôs journey.¬†

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a constant questioning of how young I am or how inexperienced I might be,‚Äù shares Sriram of Shiok Meats. She also had to deal with assumptions about what she and her co-founder, Ka Yi Ling, aimed to do and the niche market they wanted to enter.¬†
‚ÄúWhen we first started out, we had a number of people tell us:¬† ‚ÄòOh, this is so new! You guys are great scientists ‚Äì you‚Äôve worked at ASTAR. Why would you leave your high-paying jobs to do this? Have you gone crazy? Nobody has heard of cell-based meat in Southeast Asia. You‚Äôll never raise money; you‚Äôll never form a company,‚Äô‚Äù she adds.¬†
Carmina Bayombong, founder and CEO of education fintech company InvestEd, echoes this sentiment.¬†
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs unconscious bias when you‚Äôre female. There‚Äôs another layer of unconscious bias when you‚Äôre an impact entrepreneur¬†‚Äì I experience double the bias,‚Äù she contends.
¬†

Much has been said about driving entrepreneurship in Southeast Asia, but what about getting more women into the scene? Our respondents think that better support networks, investments, representation, and education are necessary to make that happen.¬†
Over 33% of respondents said that having more communities that can offer resources and guidance to female founders as well as women-focused training programs and grants are instrumental to encouraging more women to go into entrepreneurship.¬†
Investments are also vital, with nearly one-fifth of respondents highlighting it as a key driver. Funding would open up more opportunities for female founders and enable them to take the first step in getting their businesses off the ground.¬†
Greater representation matters as well, with more than 17% of respondents saying that showcasing stories of female founders at all stages of the journey would help inspire new entrepreneurs. After all, it‚Äôs hard to be what you cannot envision.¬†
Around 7% of respondents believe that education could serve as a stepping stone to entrepreneurship. The work needs to start in schools, where young women can be encouraged to go into STEM¬†fields, seek mentorship, and find support to dream bigger and take more risks.¬†
Aside from these four main elements, working to eliminate bias and creating an ecosystem that can support women in the workforce at a structural level can help put more women on the entrepreneur path.¬†

The founders we surveyed are bullish on the future of female entrepreneurship in Southeast Asia. The overall sentiment is that as the ecosystem flourishes, gender parity and equality becomes more attainable, and more women join the space, a brighter tomorrow lies ahead.¬†
Over 33% of respondents said that the growth of a greater ecosystem around female founders is one of their aspirations. They want to have more community networks and support as well as funding and opportunities. They also advocate for a ‚Äúvirtuous cycle,‚Äù where successful entrepreneurs mentor and reinvest in a new generation of founders.¬†
More than 31% of respondents are eager to see more women starting up, making headlines for their success, and building great businesses.¬†
And approximately 26% hope that Southeast Asia‚Äôs startup scene will achieve true equity and equality.¬†
This includes moving past biases, seeing more women in leadership positions and getting access to opportunities as much as male founders do. And beyond just having the unique experiences and perspectives of women be cherished and acknowledged, they envision a future where female entrepreneurship isn‚Äôt anything remarkable in and of itself, but just a fact of life.¬†


We asked our respondents to share some advice for other women who also want to walk the path of entrepreneurship. While they talked about different aspects of their journey, they all had one thing to say if you‚Äôre thinking about starting up: Just do it. It‚Äôs an incredible time to be a founder in Southeast Asia, and the future is certainly a bright one.

Eight years ago, Aileen Lee, a venture capitalist at Cowboy Ventures, came up with the term ‚Äúunicorn‚Äù to describe a startup with a valuation of US$1 billion or more.
Today, a host of Southeast Asian startups have broken into this elite club, thanks to a surge in funding from venture capitalists, corporations, and other investors looking to claim a stake in the region‚Äôs growing tech startup ecosystem.

The success of companies like Sea Group, Gojek, and Grab has spurred this wave of interest in the space.
As a result, the region now has 48 such unicorns (which also includes a number of decacorns ‚Äì startups valued at U$10 billion or more), according to Tech in Asia‚Äôs analysis.
Ôªø
Over the past few years, the number of new unicorns born annually in Southeast Asia has grown steadily. In fact, 2021 has already been a record year for startups in the region, with at least 25 companies hitting the US$1 billion mark in 2021. Darwinbox was the first regional unicorn in 2022.

When it comes to the geographical split, a majority of Southeast Asian unicorns are based in Singapore, followed by Indonesia, and Vietnam. Thailand and Malaysia both gave birth to their first unicorns this year.


So far, Sequoia and 500 Startups have backed the most number of unicorns from Southeast Asia. Meanwhile, Accel, Alpha JWC Ventures, East Ventures, Vertex Ventures, Golden Gate Ventures, Heliconia Capital Management, SoftBank, and Goldman Sachs follow closely behind.

736193,2022-03-08T05:00:16,How India‚Äôs tech titans square up against Chinese peers,"
Image credit: Timmy Loen

Hours before India‚Äôs inaugural national startup day, the country‚Äôs prime minister, Narendra Modi, declared that startups were ‚Äúgoing to be the backbone of a new India.‚Äù
Modi‚Äôs exuberance comes as India‚Äôs startup ecosystem reaches new heights. In a recent speech, he noted that the number of startups based in India had skyrocketed from to 60,000 from less than 500 in 2017. Last year, the country also welcomed 42 new unicorns.
While India now mints new unicorns almost as quickly as China, there‚Äôs still a gulf between the startup ecosystems of the two neighbors.
Not quite toe to toe yet
Unlike China, many of India‚Äôs top tech companies today are spin-offs ‚Äì like Tech Mahindra and Tata Consulting ‚Äì from large, family-owned conglomerates. All of these firms were established between 1968 to 2000.

These spin-offs all operate in the IT services sector and are the largest Indian tech companies by market value. Tata Consulting, for example, largely provides tech consulting and business process outsourcing services.

Despite their age, India‚Äôs top 10 tech companies‚Äô combined valuation trailed their Chinese peers‚Äô as a percentage of their home countries‚Äô gross domestic product between 2016 to 2020. India nearly closed the gap with China in 2018, when the latter was locked in a trade war with the US.

In absolute terms, the combined valuation of the top 10 Chinese tech firms is over fourfold that of their Indian peers.
The contrast is even more stark when we look at the fifth to tenth largest Indian tech companies, which mostly comprise recent entrants like food delivery firm Zomato and digital payments provider Paytm. Here, Chinese tech companies‚Äô combined valuation is more than sevenfold that of their Indian counterparts.
What‚Äôs holding India‚Äôs tech scene back?
Essentially, India sets itself apart from China in two ways: a leaderboard dominated by stalwart tech spinoffs that don‚Äôt pull their weight in market value and a late boom in significantly smaller unicorns. But what explains these issues for the world‚Äôs fifth-largest economy?
For one, large spinoffs like Tata Consulting and Tech Mahindra have been slow to pivot away from low-value legacy businesses that scale linearly. To grow them, employee headcounts must tick up.

Although these industry titans have tried to decouple growth from headcount since 2013, stagnant operating margins suggest that these efforts have not yet borne fruit.
Other factors, such as a weakening cost arbitrage advantage and clients‚Äô growing preference for automation and in-house operations, have also stunted the growth of India‚Äôs tech conglomerates.
What about India‚Äôs late boom in relatively small unicorns? Here, India‚Äôs public sector appears to trail China‚Äôs in terms of support to startups.

The duration of entrepreneurial finance policies active between 1995 to 2019 in India suggests that they could be outdated and less responsive to startups‚Äô fast-changing needs.
One India-based founder Tech in Asia spoke to complained of ‚Äúmany hurdles to jump‚Äù and having to appeal to bureaucrats who ‚Äúrarely understand the product or opportunity.‚Äù The founder declined to be named.
In contrast, China‚Äôs government has been more proactive in supporting startups.
Since launching a broad startup ecosystem development strategy in 2015, China climbed the ranks of the global innovation index, going from the 35th spot in 2013 to the 14th position in 2020. Today, the country ranks 12th among 132 economies worldwide.

Trends in China and India‚Äôs information and communications technology (ICT) patent grant rate in recent years also reveal a gulf in innovation. To quote Indian tech entrepreneur Vinayak Dalmia, India‚Äôs startup ecosystem is ‚Äútoo many apps and not enough innovation.‚Äù
Making India Tech 2.0 work
Can India‚Äôs new tech unicorns climb the leaderboard as their Chinese peers have?
The good news is that Modi‚Äôs government has already doubled down on supporting the country‚Äôs startups.


Earlier last month, the government allocated US$37.8 million to the flagship Startup India Seed Fund Scheme ‚Äì nearly three times bigger than earlier estimates.
Other measures include simplifying tax procedures, allowing self-certification for select labor and environmental laws, and doing away with over 25,000 compliance regulations.
Unlike many past initiatives that targeted specific demographics or industries, the country‚Äôs latest slew of support schemes for startups are founder and sector-agnostic.


Still, it‚Äôll likely take more than just generous funding and easier compliance for India‚Äôs tech startups to square up to China‚Äôs. India‚Äôs leading entrepreneurship hubs also lag behind its neighbor‚Äôs in terms of talent availability, research and patent activity, and access to customers.
Modi‚Äôs initiatives are just step one of three in developing the country‚Äôs startups. The path to building institutions that promote innovation and ‚Äúhandholding‚Äù young innovators may not be as clear-cut.",Tay Tian Wen,Terence Lee and Arpit Nayak,0,"['Premium Content', 'Visual Stories']",True,True,4

681468,2022-03-07T12:15:22,The leading Asian tech players eyeing an IPO in 2022 and beyond (Updated),"This is the latest version of the article that was previously updated on February 17, 2022. 
Many startups dream about going public. It allows them to raise much more capital than from private equity investors and venture capital firms. Equity mutual funds in the US alone manage US$8.4 trillion domestically- that‚Äôs six times the comparable value handled by buyout funds and 18 times what venture capital oversee.
Recently, there seems to be a rush for an initial public offering among tech startups. Among US companies, some of the biggest-ever tech IPOs by capital raised took place in 2020. Food delivery platform DoorDash and vacation rental firm Airbnb listed last December, while software provider Snowflake went public in September.

Sea listed on NYSE / Photo credit: NYSE

In Asia, some tech startups that did an IPO last year include short-video platform and TikTok rival Kuaishou, which raised US$5.4 billion in its Hong Kong listing in January 2021, and JD.com, which raised US$3.8 billion in its secondary listing, also in Hong Kong.
Asian firms are increasingly opting for IPOs as tech stocks boomed amid the pandemic. As such, several startups in the region are looking to strike while the iron‚Äôs hot.
Tech in Asia‚Äôs analysis shows that 95 tech startups across China, India, and Southeast Asia are reportedly planning for an IPO this year and beyond. Out of this number, 40 startups could collectively raise over US$27.83 billion.

However, this figure could potentially surpass US$23.24 billion since heavyweights like Traveloka and ByteDance haven‚Äôt set or disclosed their target fundraising amounts.

Most of the Asian startups looking to list on the bourses come from the ecommerce space, followed by fintech, artificial intelligence, and ride-hailing.¬†

Our analysis also shows that the US is one of the most sought-after destinations for these companies, especially for Southeast Asian firms. This isn‚Äôt surprising, given the success of New York Stock Exchange-listed Sea Group, which currently has a market valuation of over US$120 billion. That‚Äôs several times larger than any of the top tech firms in the region.

Meanwhile, most Indian companies are choosing to go public in their home markets, except for Walmart-owned ecommerce player Flipkart, fintech merchants platform Pine Labs, and advertising tech startup InMobi, which want to list on the US stock market.
Following the US and Indian markets is the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, which is seeing more homecoming listings from Chinese firms. This is a change from a few years earlier, when Chinese companies favored listing on the US stock exchanges.
One reason for this could be the heightened political tensions between China and the US, which drove Chinese tech firms to seek out exchanges closer to home.¬†
These companies could also be concerned about being removed from US stock markets. Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, one of China‚Äôs major chipmakers, ceased its trading shares in the US in January after it was added to a trade blacklist by the US government.
In December 2020, the US House of Representatives passed a bill that allows the delisting of Chinese firms that don‚Äôt let US inspectors review their auditors‚Äô work for three consecutive years. The legislation was adopted by the US Securities and Exchange Commission in March.
Soaring SPACs
Some startups are choosing a different route to go public. Last year, blank-check or special purpose acquisition companies (SPAC) IPOs accounted for most of the growth in the IPO market in the US compared to 2019.¬†

Listing via a SPAC is less time-consuming, taking around six months instead of the usual six to nine months for a traditional IPO. Going the blank-check route also offers upfront liquidity and greater certainty around valuation.
While only a minority of firms are considering a SPAC, some of Southeast Asia‚Äôs leading tech startups, such as¬† Traveloka and GoTo Group, are taking this alternative. The only company outside the region that might opt to merge with a blank-check firm for a US listing is India‚Äôs Flipkart.


As soon as these tech startups go public, their early investors can finally cash out and make a fortune.¬†

Hello reader,
You have to hand it to Mark Zuckerberg. When the Facebook founder chose to rename the company‚Äôs parent firm to Meta Platforms to build an alternate digital world known as the metaverse, he was mercilessly criticized.
He was considered just another middle-aged tech billionaire chasing a childhood dream, similar to what Amazon‚Äôs Jeff Bezos and Tesla‚Äôs Elon Musk did with space rockets.
And yet his timing was impeccable. While Wall Street has been fanning the hype, Southeast Asia has witnessed the quiet rise of metaverse builder RFox. The bootstrapped startup, which was launched right before the crypto boom, plans to create localized metaverses in the region.
In today‚Äôs big story, my colleague Nikita decodes the metaverse possibilities through RFox.

RFox founder Ben Fairbank describes his version of a metaverse as a big box with hooks, where anyone can plug any application or blockchain into the box.
While the Vietnam-headquartered company has been flying under the radar all this while, it may step into the limelight once it launches an immersive retail and entertainment-centric metaverse to the public sometime in the middle of the year.
RFox also has a well-stocked arsenal in the battle to build metaverses, where 25% of people will fancy spending at least one hour a day for work, shopping, education, social, or entertainment purposes.


Going places: The Valt is a global virtual reality metaverse. RFox aims to create localized Valts next, starting with the Philippines later this year and then moving on to Vietnam and Indonesia. Services such as food courts, clothing businesses, and billboard advertisements will be locally influenced.


Deal town: RFox has a tie-up with Lazada Philippines for cashback and rewards that will go live once the Valt is open. The partnership will focus on ecommerce livestreaming, where Lazada will offer an 8% cashback to RFox for every purchase through the livestream content. The metaverse startup is also looking for people who can bring value regarding networking or partnerships.


Metaverse user manual: The Valt is looking to attract traffic to its four quarters. Auctions for the virtual plots of two of these areas ‚Äì the art-focused quarter Callinova and gaming district Arkamoto ‚Äì are already over. RFox wants to help businesses set up shop in its virtual world without the need to worry about building an audience from scratch.

Fighting the changing face of fraud

For as long as there‚Äôs been money to be made, fraud has existed, going from tactics like counterfeit money and fake checks to new strategies like identity fraud and promo abuse. As Southeast Asia continues to digitalize, more people are coming online for the first time, creating more opportunities for fraudsters.
According to a report by GrabDefence and Forrester, seven out of 10 surveyed organizations experienced fraud in the last 12 months, significantly impacting their businesses. And as firms try to fight fraud, they have to strike a balance between preventing major risks and keeping the customer journey frictionless.

On March 23, industry experts will weigh in on the region‚Äôs fraud landscape, share insights from the GrabDefence and Forrester report, and discuss recommendations for businesses to enhance their fraud management capabilities.

The company aims to be the Y combinator of GameFi and metaverse projects by using the team‚Äôs resources and technical know-how. Its team of over 20 developers and operational management has been working on launchpads, GameFi, contracting, and blockchain development for more than 10 years.
GamePad said most launchpads focus on the public sale of digital assets, resulting in the token price crashing after it lists and good projects losing momentum in the community quickly.

Episode Transcript:
Nathaniel Fetalvero (VO):
Hello and welcome to Deep Dive, a show where we discuss the biggest headlines to hit the startup scene with the journalists who broke the stories.
My name‚Äôs Nat and today, we‚Äôre going to talk about Asia‚Äôs crypto fever.
This story, like its subject matter, is one that‚Äôs rapidly developing. In fact, we‚Äôve had to constantly rescript and add stuff to this episode because so many things kept coming to our attention during the production process.
Here to break things down is my colleague, Arpit Nayak.
Arpit Nayak (VO):
A Vietnamese restaurant owner saves his business during the pandemic by making money on cryptocurrency trading. A visual artist in India makes over US$7,000 on a single NFT. VCs across the region are raising hundreds of millions of dollars to set up funds focused on investing in blockchain technology.
The Asian tech scene has recently been obsessed with all things blockchain and crypto. Call it a resurgence: the past two years have seen the most widespread adoption of the technology since the crypto winter of 2018.
And what‚Äôs interesting is that different markets have had varying reasons for catching crypto fever. The catalyst for adoption in Vietnam, for instance, was gaming. The emergence of Sky Mavis‚Äô blockchain-powered game Axie Infinity marked the country as a hotspot on the global crypto map when it racked up close to 2 million daily active users sometime last year.
But the reason for gaming being such a crucial factor for the Vietnam crypto boom can be attributed to another Vietnamese game that took the world by storm in 2014. Here‚Äôs Tech in Asia journalist Thu Huong Le on the matter.
Thu Huong Le:
Before Axie infinity, we had Flappy Bird, which was also a global phenomenon. Flappy Bird actually had 50 million downloads in 2014, which I also wrote about back then.
The game‚Äôs developer ended up killing off Flappy Bird because he couldn‚Äôt handle the pressure, but just to note that Axie infinity just reflects that Vietnam has a very strong gaming culture. Our first tech unicorn is VNG, which specializes in game publishing.
Arpit Nayak (VO):
That gaming culture, coupled with a robust pool of developers in the country, meant that Vietnam was the ideal breeding ground for Axie Infinity to achieve unprecedented success.
Thu Huong Le:
So it had, like, phenomenal success in the Philippines, where some players there managed to own, like, enough money to buy houses. But certainly, in order to play Axie, you have to learn how to buy Axies, you have to learn about crypto. But certainly, GameFi can be the beginning of, you know, people‚Äôs crypto journey, but it‚Äôs not everything.
Arpit Nayak (VO):
To add to that perfect storm, Vietnam‚Äôs tech-savvy population, the dampening of other investment channels, as well as the lockdowns due to Covid-19 further drove crypto adoption in the country.
Thu Huong Le:
So, similar to other countries, in Vietnam, the ways to invest, like real estate and gold, have been hit hard by lockdowns, interest rates have been very low. So for the older generation, like my mother, investment has always been real estate and gold, but for the Gen Z and millennials, who are online more and more because of the pandemic and have more incentive to find ways to make money, obviously, crypto is very appealing.
Also, as a lot of people told me and I point out in the article, crypto is really trendy. The starting capital is small and, also, the Gen Z and millennials really find NFTs, blockchain, and web 3 to be very attractive ‚Äì the stock market is not flexible enough for them and it doesn‚Äôt have the attractiveness of such technology.
Arpit Nayak (VO):
What that led to is almost 6 million people in Vietnam owning a digital asset, putting the country among the top five in the world in terms of crypto adoption ‚Äì a stunning figure for what is still primarily a cash-based society.
In fact, crypto‚Äôs penetrated Vietnam‚Äôs population so deeply that even the threat of scams doesn‚Äôt stop traders from trying to make a quick buck.
Thu Huong Le:
There‚Äôs actually scams in lending and also crypto being reported by local media. There have been, like, a few projects here that are totally scams. But scams are everywhere, it can happen in all sectors.
For Vietnamese adopters, I think Vietnamese people have a very strong entrepreneurial spirit. Making money online has become, like, so trendy. So the hardcore traders, as I say, are willing to take these risks.
I talked to one of the young traders, he is friends with experts who can suggest him projects and who suggests him what to buy, how the market‚Äôs going to fluctuate and, also, as I point out in my article, the Vietnamese crypto adopters are very community-based. So they share tips in order how to avoid scams and you can attend these online forums to ask people, but obviously, you have to make the final decision and you have to manage the risks. I mean, that‚Äôs part of the challenge of being a crypto adopter, I guess.
Arpit Nayak (VO):
Over in India, the tale of the country‚Äôs ride onto the crypto wave goes a little differently. Here‚Äôs Tech in Asia journalist Nikita Puri‚Äôs take on it.
Nikita Puri:
So I think the first few headlines that I saw, I just brushed past them, I wasn‚Äôt really interested. But then it seemed like after a while, I couldn‚Äôt skip them anymore. They were just about everywhere. And that‚Äôs when I started looking closely at my Twitter thread, at social media in general, and I realized that India was really getting hooked onto NFTs.
Arpit Nayak (VO):
An NFT or non-fungible token is a unique representation of an asset on a blockchain supported by a smart contract. Tech in Asia‚Äôs Originals team actually produced an explainer video on it some time back if you want to learn more ‚Äì links below ‚Äì but essentially, NFTs allow people to verifiably say that they own a digital asset such as a piece of art, for example.
But on top of using NFTs to own art, people in India were buying NFTs driven by celebrities.
Autographs, poem recitals, movie posters, anything tied to sports stars or actors were getting NFT-ed ‚Äì and they were selling fast.
Nikita Puri:
India just has this really close relationship with celebrities ‚Äì any celebrity worth their salt, whether they be cricketers or if they are film stars ‚Äì doesn‚Äôt quite matter because the fan base for it is really big, really dedicated, and really committed.
It doesn‚Äôt matter if they played a bad match or if their last film was a flop. It‚Äôs about the legacy, the vibe around the actor or the cricketer that sort of has led to this whole NFT craze also.
And for the celebrities themselves, it doesn‚Äôt take much because they‚Äôre capitalizing, they‚Äôre monetizing on the legacy that they have already built.
Arpit Nayak (VO):
And it‚Äôs not just the celebrities who stand to earn a pretty sum from this NFT craze, as Nikita calls it. Those who buy NFTs actually have a chance of making bank too, as in the case of those who bought NFTs of a film directed by renowned filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma last year.
Nikita Puri:
So basically what happened was, basically, the people who bought NFTs of that Ram Gopal Varma film, unless they want to trade it and sell it off, they will forever hold that particular entity ‚Äì it‚Äôs theirs, they own that film.
Now, what has happened is, that film has actually been picked up by distributors. So now, when perhaps, you know, the world gets better and more people start going to cinema halls, that film might actually come out in the theaters. And when that happens, these people who have bought those NFTs, they will also get a part of the revenues that come out of this film.
Arpit Nayak (VO):
Aside from these celebrity-tagged NFTs, tokens of indigenous art are also being minted.
Nikita Puri:
So, you know, we talked about celebrities sort of driving the NFT wave in India, but I think it‚Äôs also really significant to realize that there is another sort of trend developing in India where we are focusing on indigenous art. Homegrown NFT marketplaces distinctly have a local appeal and this is set to grow in the art NFT market. On WazirX, for example, there are a lot of artists putting up NFTs of certain tribal art.
So basically, you know, these experiments with traditional art, which may not have otherwise found such an access to a whole different market altogether, is something that‚Äôs very, very interesting to me. A lot of platforms are tying up with, you know, historical places or sites with historical importance, and bringing them out as NFTs.
For example, there was the warrior kingdom of Mysore where, you know, India had kings and queens and princes. The prince is still there and he‚Äôs tied up with an NFT marketplace to bring out artworks which are inspired by the history of the kingdom. And it was this glorious kingdom at one point in time. That is another direction this thing is headed into.
Arpit Nayak (VO):
We‚Äôll be right back.
[AD]
Arpit Nayak (VO):
Despite the rapid adoption that cryptocurrency and NFTs have seen in the region, the industry faces an eventual roadblock in the form of local government regulations. For instance, in 2018, the State Bank of Vietnam banned cryptocurrency-related transactions via the banking system.
Thu Huong Le:
It‚Äôs really hard to know exactly how Vietnam would regulate crypto. But the state bank has been tasked with studying crypto, and potentially there will be a pilot program. It‚Äôs also unclear what this pilot program will include.
But it‚Äôs still very early and it‚Äôs going to take quite some time for regulators here ‚Äì not just here, but also Southeast Asia and the world ‚Äì to actually understand how to regulate it. For Vietnam, our regulators are very protective of the traditional financial system, which makes sense because we need to protect our economy, right?
Arpit Nayak (VO):
The state of regulation in India isn‚Äôt clear either. In 2018, regulators similarly barred banks from dealing with crypto exchanges, hampering the growth of crypto-related startups in the country. Though the ban was lifted in 2020, the country still lacks a legal framework surrounding these companies.
Then last month, India‚Äôs finance minister proposed a 30% tax on digital assets.
Nikita Puri:
It is a massive speed bump, actually. Because if I‚Äôm looking to quickly take out my money, if I‚Äôm doing it just for the sake of earning a living, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs very feasible. A 30% tax is quite high.
We‚Äôre also a little unclear about the whole legal aspect of it because after the ministry announced that there‚Äôs going to be tax, two days later they said crypto is not legal in the country. So that, again, sent heads scratching and people are wondering what does it mean, you know, really, where do we stand? A lot of people feel like we‚Äôve gone one step ahead, but two steps behind.
Arpit Nayak (VO):
But why exactly are regulators hesitant to implement clear legislations for cryptocurrency? And why are the policies so harsh when governments do regulate the industry? My colleague, Melissa Goh, might have the answer.
Melissa Goh:
I feel like when it comes to crypto regulation ‚Äì and I think this is Singapore‚Äôs stance on it ‚Äì is that we‚Äôre still in early days in terms of regulation. So I think no regulator, no government is in a rush to implement the sort of legislation or rules there for firms. And I feel like most governments have adopted this cautious approach where they are just trying to one-up each other, but just slightly.
So in Singapore‚Äôs case, it has started offering licenses to firms, so firms are welcome to apply, but it hasn‚Äôt fully opened the doors. But from the regulator standpoint, there is no rush to give 100 firms a license to provide those kinds of services today.
Arpit Nayak (VO):
This approach to legislation has led to major crypto industry players like Binance to withdraw their applications for a license in the city-state in favor of setting up shop in Dubai, which has been far more crypto friendly.
But while that may seem like a loss for Singapore, there are some drawbacks to being too early an adopter of emerging tech like crypto.
Melissa Goh:
I think there‚Äôs definitely a first-mover advantage, but I think the risks of that are huge, right? The risks of being a first mover and making a huge misstep, and the probability of that happening, it‚Äôs pretty large. And in some ways, I wouldn‚Äôt say that Singapore is losing out.
Like in the grand scheme of things, if you look at the kinds of regulations that have been rolled out in other jurisdictions around the world, whether it‚Äôs in the US, Europe, other parts of Asia, I think Singapore can still very much be considered ‚Äì if not the first mover ‚Äì one of the first movers still. So I don‚Äôt think Singapore sees itself as losing out in that aspect. And at the same time, I think Singapore would rather be cautious than to be a first mover and then be exposed to those kinds of risks.
And I think I‚Äôll quote someone here, Ravi Menon from the Monetary Authority of Singapore. He said this last November, and I quote, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt need 160 of them to set up shop here‚Äù ‚Äì referring to crypto providers ‚Äì ‚Äúhalf of them can do so, but with very high standards. That, I think, is a better outcome.‚Äù And I think that perfectly sums up Singapore‚Äôs stance on that.
Arpit Nayak (VO):
It does feel like a bit of a chicken or egg situation. With regulators across the region still waiting and watching the crypto scene for developments before making a move, many startups in the industry are left waiting and watching before they can innovate to the technology‚Äôs fullest potential.
But with the looming web 3 and metaverse opportunity on the horizon, more leading tech companies across the globe are sure to realize blockchain‚Äôs potential. Then, it‚Äôll only be a matter of time before legislators have to act.

Hello reader,
It was that week in the quarter again, when the household names from Southeast Asia‚Äôs tech industry revealed their GDP-sized earnings results, along with guidance on their near to medium-term financial prospects.
Usually, these events signal the strength of tech businesses in the region, but this time around, it left investors wanting more, way more.
These closely watched reports not only provide an insightful view into the current state of a company‚Äôs operations but also often send investors either scampering to buy or sell stock and, generally, form the basis of ratings and price target recommendations by Wall Street analysts.

It‚Äôs only fitting to kick off discussions on the recent earnings reports with that of the poster child of Southeast Asian tech businesses: Grab (GRAB, NDAQ). Founded in 2012, the super app has experienced something of a fall from grace since its market debut in December.
A sudden surge of investor optimism heading into its Q4 earnings report quickly went up in smoke, with the Singapore-headquartered firm‚Äôs shares plunging well over a third of its value, or roughly 37%, after posting its results.
Grab‚Äôs Q4 results hardly paint a pretty picture and, perhaps, has justified investor skepticism over its stock in recent months.
It may be the case that CEO Anthony Tan‚Äôs grand plan for Grab needs more time to bear fruit, but the market has no patience under the current macro environment. Grab‚Äôs share price has fallen about 70% in the last three months. You can find an in-depth review of Grab‚Äôs financial health here.
Another company with a strong claim to being the face of Southeast Asian tech firms‚Äô rapid rise is Sea Group (SE, NYSE), which fared mildly better than its counterpart. This is hardly conciliatory, given that the firm has trimmed over US$130 billion in market value from its peak last November, while its share price hit new 52-week lows last week.
Sea shed about US$10.4 billion in market value after slashing its year-on-year booking guidance for its digital entertainment unit Garena for the first time. India‚Äôs ban on Free Fire has been a thorn in Sea‚Äôs share price, but as my colleague Simon reports in this premium story, there are glimmers of hope that Sea can pull itself out of a deep hole.
Over in China, Baidu‚Äôs (BIDU, NDAQ) investors would be forgiven for fearing the worst after Alibaba‚Äôs (BABA, NDAQ) disappointing earnings last month.
However, the search engine, whose stock price has shown resilience in the face of China‚Äôs big tech crackdown, bucked the trend. Its rise in quarterly revenue was warmly embraced by the market. Baidu‚Äôs share price rose immediately following results, but eventually succumbed to broad market-wide weakness to end the week down nearly 4%.

4 Stocks to watchHot stocks, earnings reports, restructuring, activist investor pressure, and more. We feature the stocks that are likely to make big moves during the week.

NIO ES6 electric SUV semi-autonomous car on display / Photo credit: 123rf.com

üá®üá≥ Nio Inc (NIO, NYSE): The Chinese electric vehicle maker plans to carry out secondary listings by introduction in Hong Kong and Singapore. The firm has received preliminary approval from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, where its shares are due to trade on March 10, and the Singapore Exchange is reviewing its application.
Concerns over being forced off the US exchanges amid China‚Äôs tech crackdown likely stoked these moves. Nio‚Äôs primary listing will remain in New York for now. Additionally, the company reported 6,131 vehicle deliveries in February, up 9.9% year over year but down 36% sequentially. The stock has more than halved in value over the last six months.
üáÆüá© Bukalapak (BUKA, IDX): This ecommerce giant became the first Indonesian unicorn to list on the country‚Äôs stock exchange last year. However, since its market debut, the company‚Äôs shares have fallen nearly 70%.
In an attempt to reverse its fortunes, Bukalapak looks to launch its e-grocery business, AlloFresh. The new venture will launch with around US$69.7 million from Bukalapak, Growtheum Capital Partners, and Trans Retail Indonesia ‚Äì a local offline retailer owned by conglomerate CT Corp Group.
üá≤üáæ Capital A (CAPITALA, KLSE): When AirAsia rebranded itself as Capital A in January, it was a statement by the company that it was seeking to expand its services beyond its core airline and cargo delivery businesses. From unveiling AirAsia Ride to launching its food delivery service in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand, Capital A has made significant leaps in realizing its super-app ambitions.
Now, it is taking its financial product marketplace, AirAsia Money, to Indonesia. It has partnered with local insurance startup PasarPolis, investment app Bareksa, donation platform Rumah Zakat, and payment service Wise in the release of the new service.
üáØüáµ Panasonic Corp (6752, TYO): A long-time supplier for Tesla Inc (TSLA, NDAQ), the electric vehicle (EV) battery maker plans to begin mass-producing a new type of lithium-ion battery for Tesla before the end of March 2024 with two new production lines at its western Japanese plant in Wakayama.
Panasonic is looking to double down on its partnership with Tesla, which stretches back over a decade, as it looks to invest several billions of dollars to build a mega factory in the US to support the US EV behemoth.

1Ô∏è‚É£ No IPO pain, no IPO gain: China‚Äôs most popular fitness app, Keep Inc, has filed for an IPO in Hong Kong after it reportedly pulled the plug on a US$500 million listing on US stock exchanges. The pricing and size of the IPO are yet to be determined.
Keep becomes the latest high-profile Chinese firm to have its IPO plans disrupted after Beijing‚Äôs rising scrutiny of overseas listings pushed social networking platform Soul and podcasting app Ximalaya to shelve their US listing plans.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Musk brothers in hot water: Tesla CEO Elon Musk and his brother, Kimbal Musk, are being investigated by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on whether their recent stock sales violated the commission‚Äôs insider-trading rules.
The SEC‚Äôs investigation began last year after Kimbal sold shares of Tesla, valued at US$108 million, one day before Elon polled Twitter users asking whether he should unload 10% of his stake in the electric car maker and pledging to abide by the vote‚Äôs results. The company‚Äôs shares fell sharply in the wake of Elon‚Äôs poll, with 58% of voters saying he should sell.
3Ô∏è‚É£ A truce on the offing? For over a year, Amazon (AMZN, NDAQ) and Future Retail (FRETAIL, NSE) have been in an intense legal tussle that has stalled Future‚Äôs US$3.4 billion sale of assets to Reliance Industries (RELIANCE, NSE). In fact, the stand-off showed no signs of abating with reports claiming Amazon planned to launch criminal court proceedings against Future Retail.
However, in what appears to be a dramatic U-turn by both parties, there are now ongoing talks over an out-of-court settlement proposal. The two parties have until March 15 to explore a settlement via negotiations.

2 Eye-popping facts üëÄTech in Asia scours the internet to bring you the head-turning numbers from the world of business.


US$31 billion ‚Äì That is the minimum market value at which GoTo Group plans to go public. The Indonesian tech giant has fixed an upper limit of US$42.7 billion in market value and is looking to raise around US$1.5 billion to US$2 billion through an IPO.


US$16 billion ‚Äì That‚Äôs how much South Korea‚Äôs Hyundai Motor Co (005380, KRX) plans to invest in electric vehicle-related businesses through 2030. However this number pales in comparison to the other big automakers around the world. For instance, Toyota (7203, TYO) plans to invest US$35 billion by 2030 in its EV business, and General Motors (GM, NYSE) aims to put in US$35 billion through 2025.



The 1 you didn‚Äôt see comingWe spotlight the unusual, not-your-everyday kind of story that has got everyone talking and social media buzzing over the past week.

Feng Shui master foresaw 1MDB misery: There has been something about spirituality and finance in the world off late. After the news that the former National Stock Exchange (NSE) CEO regularly consulted a yogi to help run India‚Äôs largest stock exchange took the internet by storm, a former Goldman Sachs (GS, NYSE) banker, closely tied to the 1MDB scandal, admitted to consulting a feng shui master to see if more trouble lay ahead over the next decade.
Tim Leissner, the US government‚Äôs key witness in the trial of former Goldman colleague Roger Ng over the multibillion-dollar scam to loot Malaysia‚Äôs wealth fund, said the feng shui master‚Äôs report predicted that ‚ÄúI would have an issue with authorities for the first half of the 10 years but then it would be resolved.‚Äù
The ex-banker would also consult the master on a range of matters, from the women in his life to the arrangement of his offices in Asia.

717588,2022-03-07T05:50:18,A list of India‚Äôs unicorns and their early investors (Updated),"This is the latest version of the article that was previously published on February 1, 2022.
Every entrepreneur wants their business to succeed. And getting to unicorn status ‚Äì a valuation of US$1 billion ‚Äì is a notable milestone in that journey.
India, home to more than a billion people, has already produced a number of unicorns over the years, thanks to a surge in funding from venture capitalists, corporations, and other investors looking to claim a stake in the country‚Äôs fast-growing tech startup ecosystem.

Image credit: Timmy Loen

The success of companies such as Flipkart, Byju‚Äôs, Paytm, Zomato, Oyo, Ola, Udaan, and many others has ushered a wave of interest in Indian startups. Some of these startups have either already gone public or are on the path to a listing.
Because of the rise in funding, India now has 81 unicorns ‚Äì which includes a few decacorns or startups valued at U$10 billion and above ‚Äì according to Tech in Asia‚Äôs analysis.

The number of new unicorns born annually in India has grown steadily over the past few years. In fact, 2021 had seen 41 startups from the country reach the coveted unicorn status ‚Äì a record for the South Asian nation. The meteoric rise of startups like Apna is also a reflection of this rapid growth. The jobs and professional network platform startup rocketed into the billion-dollar club within two years of its inception, becoming the fastest Indian startup to do so.

So far, Sequoia Capital and Accel have backed the most number of unicorns in India. Tiger Global, Accel Partners, and Elevation Capital (SAIF Partners) round out the list of the top five VCs backing unicorns in the country.

In January, disgruntled investors in the US sued celebrities such as reality TV star Kim Kardashian, former boxing champion Floyd Mayweather, and ex-NBA player Paul Pierce after a cryptocurrency they promoted shed roughly about 97% of its value.
For many in Singapore, this incident might be entertainment fodder. For a few others, however, this scenario may hit a little too close to home. After all, some social media influencers in the city-state have also been promoting digital coins to their followers that ultimately lost most of their value.
One such influencer is Ryan Tan, who was previously embroiled in a public spat with his ex-wife Sylvia Chan. The couple co-founded Night Owl Cinematics, a YouTube channel and production firm known for its lifestyle and comedy videos.

These incidents, in light of the Monetary Authority of Singapore‚Äôs recent ban on crypto-related advertising, raise questions about the legality and ethics of influencers promoting cryptocurrency, which is rife with scams and pump-and-dump schemes.
The birth of the ‚ÄúCrypto King‚Äù
While his feud with Chan was playing out in the media in late 2021, Tan started posting about crypto on his Instagram stories. In them, he shared about his two-week foray into non-fungible tokens or NFTs and play-to-earn (P2E) gaming.
Tan also included a link to help his followers set up accounts on the popular Metamask crypto wallet as well as two other centralized crypto exchanges (CEXes). He promoted his own crypto Telegram group ‚Äì which he later named ‚ÄúCrypto King‚Äù ‚Äì to his followers, encouraging them to join so they can start their crypto journey with his guidance. (He runs a separate social media channel called Reno King that focuses on home renovations.)

In the next few stories, Tan talked about two P2E games that he was playing and gave brief pointers about their pros and cons.
The first game he introduced was Bomb Crypto.

Tan also shared a price chart of $BCoin, the native token of the Bomb Crypto game that players will earn. Of course, this is after said players have invested an initial sum of capital to even start playing the game.
At the time of Tan‚Äôs sharing, $BCoin was trading at S$9.48.

The second game that Tan mentioned was CryptoMines, which was growing immensely popular at the time.
Like what he did for Bomb Crypto, Tan shared the price chart of $Eternal, the native token of CryptoMines.
However, his posts about CryptoMines have since been deleted.


At the time of Tan‚Äôs sharing, $Eternal was trading at S$794.
He also set up more Telegram groups and asked his followers to join them. One of the channels was named after Bomb Crypto‚Äôs $BCoin.

How Crypto King bombed
What happened next was unfortunate but not unexpected.
A few weeks after Tan invited followers to invest their hard-earned money into the two P2E games he promoted, CryptoMines‚Äô $Eternal took a sharp dive.
At the time of writing, $Eternal is trading at around S$0.60. Tan was shilling the token back when it was priced at S$794, which means that it had lost over 99.9% of its value just a few weeks after he introduced it to his followers.

‚ÄúNot my fault‚Äù
In early January, I stumbled across Tan‚Äôs promotion of these P2E games because a friend shared them with me.
I was alarmed by how Tan appeared to have no idea what he was getting his followers into, and yet he was positioning himself as their guide in the crypto space. That‚Äôs why I called him out on his actions in my Instagram posts.
I pointed out that two weeks is not enough experience for anyone to become an expert in the crypto space and that what he did was harmful not just to his followers (as many of them would likely lose their money due to his recommendations) but also to the crypto space at large.

As CryptoMines had already crashed at that point of time, I was only able to caution people that Bomb Crypto‚Äôs $BCoin, which Tan had also been shilling, was very likely caught in a death spiral that would be difficult ‚Äì even impossible ‚Äì to recover from.

Tan responded to my posts by saying this on Instagram:

A few social media users warned Tan that he had to be more responsible in promoting tokens to his followers, especially when it involved P2E games that have Ponzi scheme-like structures where latecomers to the scene like his followers will likely lose out to the early adopters like Tan himself.
Tan replied that he‚Äôs only discussing Bomb Crypto‚Äôs ‚Äúcurrent state and [his] opinions of it,‚Äù stressing that he can‚Äôt control what others decide to do. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like blaming the internet because your kids went to watch porn on it. It‚Äôs what they choose to do with the tool and information üòÇ,‚Äù he pointed out.
‚ÄúBy the way, I‚Äôm not paid nor sponsored by bomb crypto (I wish though) I was really just sharing from my point of view hahahah so if it offends you, I‚Äôm really sorry! üò¢,‚Äù he added.

A few weeks after this online confrontation happened, $BCoin plummeted by a massive 97.9% of its value and was trading at around S$0.50 at the time of writing.
In comparison, blue-chip cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum lost no more than half their value during the same period.

Since the collapse of $BCoin, Tan has stopped posting about Bomb Crypto and has not appeared at all in the Crypto King (bcoin) chat for two months now. He has not responded to Tech in Asia‚Äôs multiple requests for comment.
Problematic moves
Tan‚Äôs actions may be problematic for a few reasons.
Lack of knowledge about the P2E space
First, judging from Tan‚Äôs posts, it‚Äôs possible that he has no clue about what P2E games truly entail. Given how he was only in the crypto space for two weeks before he began sharing, this is to be expected.
As such, Tan isn‚Äôt in a position to offer any advice regarding P2E investments. Further, according to people who have been embedded in the crypto space for much longer than Tan, P2E games may actually be one of the worst ways for beginners to get started in crypto.
‚ÄúThe current P2E ecosystem is still pretty undeveloped and are just various iterations of Axie Infinity, which was the earliest successful P2E game,‚Äù Edmund Chua, a crypto hedge fund manager, tells Tech in Asia.
He also noted that unlike traditional games, most P2E games now are ‚Äúa grind fest and lack an element of fun,‚Äù featuring ‚Äúrepetitive gameplay with poor graphics‚Äù designed to let users earn money via items or tokens. They also ‚Äúheavily incentivize early users by providing unsustainable high rewards at the start,‚Äù which then taper off as more people who want additional income sign up.
Chua continues: ‚ÄúThe Ponzi aspect comes when new users are required to buy tokens or game items from existing users in order to play the game for income. I do feel that most new users are unaware that rewards will be gradually diluted and are spending money without fully considering the sustainability of the rewards.‚Äù
Gabriel Foo, formerly of Delphi Labs and now a senior research analyst at crypto exchange Bybit, agrees with Chua. ‚ÄúP2E games are basically yield farms [a form of crypto lending] with more steps. People play them for the financial incentive and not because of the game and how fun it is. This is inherently unsustainable as the growth slows down and demand cannot keep up as more players want to make a profit.‚Äù
The allure of fast money can be hard for people to resist, according to Jowella Lim, head of growth at SolanaFM, an indexer of the Solana blockchain. ‚ÄúMultilevel marketing mechanics and poor designs are pushed out before ensuring that the playing aspect is attractive.‚Äù
She adds: ‚ÄúThe current underlying games for P2E concepts are still horrible and it‚Äôs a very nascent space ‚Äì no one truly understands the best way to integrate the two concepts. The moment the economic incentives start to fall, we tend to see spirals where users gradually exit and there‚Äôs no re-entering because there are no social factors that keep these players attached.‚Äù
According to Chua, P2E games can become sustainable by introducing free ways to play and creating a game that‚Äôs actually fun.
P2E games should also try to ‚Äúcreate a sustainable revenue flow from all users to enhance gameplay instead of making spending essential,‚Äù he argues. ‚ÄúFor example, the use of game items in the form of cosmetics have been a major revenue generator for traditional games like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and Dota.‚Äù

Inability to conduct on-chain analysis
Tan‚Äôs supposed ignorance may extend to his failure to read on-chain signs portending trouble for the digital coins he was pushing.
On-chain signs refer to data points that Tan could have easily derived from looking at the transaction activities of CryptoMines and Bomb Crypto users that are immutably logged onto the blockchain. These signs that would have definitely warned him about the inevitable collapse of both games.
‚Äú$BCoin was more or less doomed to crash in price; there was no two ways about it,‚Äù Wen Jie Lim, principal trader at Floating Point Group, tells Tech in Asia.
In early December, when $BCoin was trading at a relatively healthy price point of around S$6 (still down a significant 37% from when Tan promoted it, though), there were already some clear on-chain indications of trouble.
For one, the increasingly larger and above-average volumes around price highs at that time seemed to signal distributive price action from large-bag holders ‚Äì aka whales ‚Äì who appeared to be selling their much lower-priced tokens at the top.

Also, in consulting $BCoin‚Äôs Block Explorer, an online tool that stores the details of all the transactions that have ever taken place on a particular blockchain network, one thing becomes obvious. Most of the top holders at that time were exhibiting a pattern of increasing holdings on one day, then immediately cutting them the next day.
These actions usually only mean two things: Either the top holders are trading their $BCoin actively or more likely, they are selling their coins to fishes, or smaller buyers who have weaker holding power.
Finally, in looking at $BCoin‚Äôs Token Contract Overview chart, one can see that the number of transactions were spiking up in tandem with the total number of unique wallets at that time, further backing the thesis that whales were indeed selling their holdings to fishes.
When all these elements are considered along with how Bomb Crypto was going to unlock some 46 million $BCoin tokens from the fourth quarter of 2021, Tan should have known that this was not going to be a sustainable game and that getting his followers to pour money into it like he did was akin to him grooming them to become his exit liquidity.
Lessons to be learned
While it‚Äôs too late to do anything about the crashed tokens and lost capital, some lessons can be learned from this mess.
First, influencers have to acknowledge that their words do hold weight. Granted, in lifestyle segments like food or home renovation, where Tan is also an influencer, the repercussions for such predicaments may not be as severe. In a space like crypto, however, the stakes are entirely different. Things can turn ugly quickly, and too often, they have.
As such, crypto influencers should have relevant expertise before even promoting anything. For instance, if Tan had the pertinent knowledge of the P2E space, he could have given his followers a more comprehensive picture of the games that he was encouraging them to invest in. This would have helped them make a more informed decision.
Additionally, if Tan had the expertise to conduct some basic on-chain analyses on the projects that he was so enthusiastically pushing, he would have been able to caution his followers about the distributive behaviors that were taking place when they happened, so that they could have better protected themselves from what was coming next.
Fathur Rahman, co-founder of SolanaFM, tells Tech in Asia that many influencers end up not properly educating their followers on the true risks involved when putting money into crypto investments. ‚ÄúThat can be a dangerous thing, especially if the followers are younger and more gullible, he says.
And yet a balance should be struck between being careful and excessive policing.
‚ÄúOn one hand, one should hope that influencers are well educated and experts in the matters they expound on. But on the other, setting too high a bar replicates the same gatekeeping effects that are antithetical to the openness and transparency commonly cited as tenets to the industry,‚Äù explains Gene Yan, director of Octava, a Singapore-based family office.
As much as it is easy for influencers like Tan to brush off his followers‚Äô losses or ruin as something of their own making, he should not have put them in that position in the first place.
SolanaFM‚Äôs Rahman says that an influencer should take responsibility for the content that they push out. ‚ÄúIf they are beginners in a particular space, they should be open and honest about that and not try to craft a certain image of themselves to put themselves in a stronger position than they should be in,‚Äù he says.
Rahman also thinks that influencers also need to be ‚Äúhonest and admit that they were wrong, like if they cause their followers to make the wrong trades and lose money, instead of always tweaking their image to show that they‚Äôre correct all the time.‚Äù
Were Tan‚Äôs actions legal?
Given the unprecedented and nascent nature of crypto and P2E games, it might seem like regulations do not apply. But that isn‚Äôt necessarily the case.
‚ÄúWhile every jurisdiction is different, it‚Äôs almost guaranteed that there are laws against running or abetting pump-and-dump schemes wherever you are,‚Äù Yan of Octava says.
Legal experts believe that there is a case for the law to step in when it comes to cases like Tan‚Äôs.
‚ÄúThere is a basic and logical principle that laws which apply offline should, in the absence of special justifications, apply equally online. In the real world, if one carelessly or recklessly advises another to make disastrous investments, one could be liable to compensate them for any resultant loss under our system of tort law,‚Äù Jerrold Soh, deputy director of the Singapore Management University (SMU) Center for Computational Law, tells Tech in Asia.
This is particularly true ‚Äúif one is a financial advisor of some sort,‚Äù he adds.
Informal investment advice, such as from friends and family, typically carry less liability. But that‚Äôs not the case for crypto influencers, who are typically far more influential.
‚ÄúI can certainly see some of the bigger personalities gaining this aura of trust, and further for some of them to abuse ‚Äì or at least mishandle ‚Äì that trust,‚Äù he says.
Erring influencers should be held responsible for their mistakes,‚Äù Soh stresses. ‚ÄúThey should be liable for investment losses their followers incur, split roughly in the proportion of how careless both sides have been.‚Äù This is in line with the legal principle of contributory negligence, which serves to deter reckless behavior from both the influencer and victim.
Vincent Ooi, a lecturer of law at SMU and the deputy head of tax at Zico Law, concurs with Soh.
He further cites the recent guidelines from central bank MAS that restrict marketing and advertising from crypto service providers in Singapore.
‚ÄúWhile these guidelines may not bind crypto influencers per se, it does mean that any potential tie-ups with digital payment token providers should pretty much be out of the question,‚Äù Ooi says.
Crypto influencers, he explains, may run into two types of risks: regulatory and private law.
On the regulatory side, influencers should watch out for the Financial Services and Markets Bill, which has expanded on what counts as ‚Äúdigital token services‚Äù that fall under the purview of MAS. These services include those that provide investment advice or analyses or induce people to buy tokens.
On the private side, influencers could be liable for breach of contract if they provide crypto trading advice for a fee and do so negligently.
Generally, the legal risks are higher if they have accepted something in return for their advice. However, a person who gives ‚Äúfree advice‚Äù can still be found liable, says Soh.
In short, crypto influencers cannot simply say whatever they want without due care. Let‚Äôs hope that Tan and anyone looking to follow in his footsteps are taking heed.",Derek Lim,Terence Lee and Eileen C. Ang,1,"['Blockchain', 'Premium Content']",True,True,14

This article is part of ‚ÄúBreak the Bias,‚Äù Tech in Asia‚Äôs campaign for International Women‚Äôs Day 2022. Through this initiative, we‚Äôre shining the spotlight on the women who are breaking barriers and achieving success in Asia‚Äôs tech and startup ecosystem.
The value of having women in leadership positions is well documented. Businesses with women at the helm, for example, are more profitable and open to transformation and change. They also have greater diversity among their teams, which in turn is correlated with greater innovation ‚Äì something that‚Äôs essential to Southeast Asia‚Äôs rapidly evolving digital economy.
As we mark International Women‚Äôs Day this year, Tech in Asia has created a list of women who run the show at the region‚Äôs 30 top-funded companies. While we realize that funding may not be the best or only indicator of success, it‚Äôs certainly a helpful metric.
To identify these leaders, we leveraged the Tech in Asia database and culled information from LinkedIn as well as company websites and organizational charts. We chose to limit the list to founders and C-suite executives of these organizations.
We hope that this list will be an inspiration and a celebration of the many female leaders in our midst who are building vital, thriving businesses in Southeast Asia.

Since 2012, Zap has been helping food and beverage (F&amp;B) merchants add rewards and loyalty programs to their businesses. The company, which took part in the inaugural cohort of Kickstart Ventures, said it now works with over 4 million users and 2,000 stores.
In June 2020, Zap ‚Äì in partnership with Shopify ‚Äì launched its e-store service that helps clients accept, fulfill, and deliver orders. In a little over a year since its launch, Zap said the business has grown 5x to onboard 483 F&amp;B companies in the Philippines.
The company was founded by Angelique Uy, Dustin Cheng, Justin Lim, and Terence Lok. Cheng, who serves as Zap‚Äôs CEO, co-founded and was the CEO of Philippine daily deals website Deal Dozen, which was acquired by Asia Deal Group in 2013.
Zap plans to use the capital to add new features to its end-to-end platform. ‚ÄúThese include richer analytics and remarketing and targeting features that will help partners foster better customer relationships and ultimately increase sales,‚Äù said Cheng.

735144,2022-03-07T02:00:10,Here are 100+ Women in Power in Southeast Asia‚Äôs tech and startup community,"In honor of International Women‚Äôs Day, Tech in Asia will be running content all week that celebrates and highlights some of the leading women in Southeast Asia‚Äôs tech and startup community. To kick things off, here is a list of 100 amazing women in the space, including founders, startup executives, and investors.

I‚Äôm starting this Women in Power List because women remain underrepresented in the tech community. Far too many founding teams, C-suite lineups, and events are still wildly imbalanced. Last year, women-only founding teams received just 2% of total funding, the lowest percentage since 2016, even as venture capital funding hit all-time highs. Yes, we can and should talk about change. But it‚Äôs 2022 ‚Äì let‚Äôs go a bit further with action and representation.
Representation affects perception, and perception shapes our reality. Representation matters.
Collectively, we must eliminate the excuse of ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt think of any women for my team/event/board.‚Äù While we are a long way from achieving parity for women in tech, we should realize that there are many, many incredible women in our community already.
So the next time a leadership opportunity comes up, if you can‚Äôt think of highly qualified, capable women, use this list. Don‚Äôt let the excuse of not knowing enough women stop you from creating better representation in the ecosystem.
Some disclaimers: This list is neither comprehensive nor ranked. There are so many more fantastic women in Southeast Asia‚Äôs startup and tech community. And ranking is super subjective and I don‚Äôt believe in such nonsense. Finally, this list is my own, not that of Tech in Asia.
I will be updating this list monthly, as this is just a starting point. If you‚Äôd like to submit a name, please do so via this form.
The need for a list
I frequently find myself sourcing speakers for Tech in Asia‚Äôs various initiatives and events. While I‚Äôve set the expectation for the team and myself to achieve gender parity in all our initiatives, we frequently fall short of our goal.
Why?

Awareness. There are simply far more men in the tech and startup scene than women. For any given opportunity, once various prerequisites are applied, it‚Äôs not uncommon to end up with a list of men without thinking.
Conversion. In absolute numbers, if not proportionally, there are many qualified women in our community. But with so many demands on their time, women must be more deliberate in picking their opportunities. As a result, representation can fall short.

Most recently for TIA School, I had to find eight founders to serve as guest lecturers for our course. By the numbers:

20 total invites
11 men, 9 women were invited
6 out of 11 men agreed to lecture (~55%)
2 out of 9 women agreed to lecture (~22% acceptance)
Final result: 2 out of 8 lecturers are women, only 25% of the total group

I had a problem at both the top and the bottom of the funnel. I didn‚Äôt invite enough women in the first place and I also didn‚Äôt account for a lower conversion rate. My intentions were not enough. I needed to design parity into the process.

The final line-up of lecturers for TIA School.

Structurally, two small interventions would have gone a long way.
First, make sure to invite at least the same number of women as men, if not more, at the outset. It can be hard to think of all the qualified women at the drop of a hat, so start with this list or any other list!
Second, present great opportunities and persist in your offers. Because there are fewer women in the tech and startup scene overall, each female leader shoulders a heavier representation burden and has to be more selective in what she takes on. So don‚Äôt use a woman moderator as a band-aid for your ‚Äúmanel‚Äù ‚Äì give her roles of substance and explain why she‚Äôs the best and most qualified person for that role. Make it worth her time.
Obviously, this issue is a complex one, and my speaker example has relatively low stakes. But it snowballs.
Fewer women being offered speaking opportunities means less of a platform for those women to be seen as leaders and leverage those opportunities for advancement. It means fewer female founders being seen as successful and potentially affecting their fundraising prospects. Fewer women in leadership roles means less role models for younger women. The problem stacks up, and even more so when we start talking about who to hire for the next fund, add to a board, or join a rocketship startup.
Break the Bias
This year‚Äôs International Women‚Äôs Day theme is Break the Bias. Biases are dangerous because they are rarely rooted in fact or logic and are based on emotion and anecdotes. Breaking those biases can be tough because it is an amorphous, shifting enemy.
One way to break the bias is to unearth, call out, and examine those biases when they are spotted. Another way is to design structures and processes to prevent biases from continuing.
The Women in Power List is my attempt to break the bias that there are not enough women leaders in our tech and startup community.
That‚Äôs simply not true.
There are many amazing female leaders already. Let‚Äôs keep highlighting and celebrating them as we work to raise more women into leadership ranks.
This week, Tech in Asia is tackling gender-based biases from different angles through think pieces, profiles, events, and surveys. Some highlights include a closed-door lunch with Love Bonito CEO Dione Song and Carsome CFO Juliet Zhu discussing how to bring more women into positions of leadership. We also had a conversation with two forward-thinking female leaders ‚Äì Ayesha Khanna from Addo AI and Godelieve van Dooren of Mercer ‚Äì about structural changes to address leadership and pay gaps. Plus, we‚Äôre releasing a qualitative survey that gives an intimate look at what it‚Äôs like being a female founder in their own words.
Finally, to really widen the top of the funnel for women in tech, we‚Äôre making a donation to Generation Girl, a non-profit organization in Indonesia that creates programs to educate and train young women in STEM disciplines.
International Women‚Äôs Day is just one day, and our content campaign is just one week, but the processes that we develop to contain biases can go a long way.
So my question back to the community is: What structures can you design to break biases?

Hi readers,
People come and go, and that‚Äôs especially true with companies and their employees. But behind every ebb and flow of talent leaving a company and joining another is a personal story that rings a truth that we all know but may choose to downplay: People matter and losing them is costly.
I‚Äôve been in the workforce for more than a decade, and I‚Äôve had my share of doing all sorts of jobs. Journalism wasn‚Äôt my first gig and when I managed to cut my teeth in the trade, I began right at the bottom as a junior writer.
Every time there was a town hall, I‚Äôd hear my previous bosses pull that cliched bluster of ‚Äúeveryone is dispensable,‚Äù only to backpedal when key staff start leaving. Then the typical song and dance ensues: The boss will counter offer, with some taking what seems like a new deal while others choosing to sever ties and move on.
That people are crucial to an organization can be gleaned from Capital A chief Tony Fernandes‚Äô LinkedIn post where he took aim at ‚Äúnew digital unicorns‚Äù who had poached his staff last year. But he wasn‚Äôt the only one in the wilderness, as my colleague Putra Muskita would find out ‚Äì MyTukar, the Malaysian arm of automotive marketplace Carro, also lost talent that year, too.
Where did these employees go? Carsome ‚Äì the rival of Carro and, to a certain extent, Capital A as well.
Some of Capital A‚Äôs and MyTukar‚Äôs former employees have been climbing up the ranks in their respective companies for over five years. What made them jump ship, I wonder, given all those years of dedication?
There were whispers of Carsome poaching them, but the company told us that no such attempts were made.
Anyway, journalism requires me to stay factual, and the fact is Carsome is currently a magnet for top talent.

Hello reader,
When I was in Melbourne central business district last week ‚Äì on holiday ‚Äì it surprised me how many people used e-scooters to get around.
While I didn‚Äôt use one myself, I was pleasantly surprised to see the name of a Singapore-headquartered e-scooter startup plastered on their sides ‚Äì always nice to see something from home even while I‚Äôm 6,000 kilometers away.
Now back at work, I‚Äôm seeing e-scooters again. This week, Singapore-headquartered micromobility company Beam raised a a series B funding round worth US$93 million, which it plans to use to speed up the deployment of its fifth generation e-scooter and introduce e-mopeds into its vehicle inventory.

735700,2022-03-04T13:16:29,"TikTok, Binance, Shopee among the most popular apps in SEA: report","As people become more familiar with shopping, investing, and consuming content on their mobile phones, mobile-first markets have been on their phones for nearly a third of their waking hours, according to Data.ai‚Äôs (formerly App Annie) State of Mobile 2022 report.
Indonesians spent more than five hours per day on mobile apps in 2021, noted the report. While India saw the most downloads among emerging markets, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Indonesia took the lead in Southeast Asia.

We look at the top apps in social, finance, and shopping segments in the region in terms of downloads and monthly active users.
The usual social suspects
TikTok took the lead in per-user engagement among social apps globally, commanding the most time spent in 2021. It was also one of the top five most downloaded apps in all Southeast Asian markets, except in Hong Kong. The app was the standout winner in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand by downloads.
Meta apps Facebook, Facebook Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp Messenger kept their hold in these markets.
With interest in metaverse springing, avatar social app Zepeto grew 160% year-on-year in downloads, noted the report.

Crypto takes the cake
Fast and simple movement of money and financial flexibility seem to be the two winning formulas for the success of finance apps, according to the report.
In Southeast Asia, Indonesia has seen the largest growth of these apps over the past four years ‚Äì up 185% ‚Äì the report noted. With cryptocurrency gaining traction, Binance has been a hit among users in the region, becoming one of the top five most-downloaded finance apps in Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines, Vietnam, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. The higher downloads could mean that Binance will also see an increase in monthly active users in these markets in the coming months.
Several other crypto apps such as Crypto.com, Bitkub, Coinhako, and MetaMask made it to the list.

Shop till you drop
Time spent on shopping apps rose by 18% year on year globally, with fast fashion and social shopping gaining traction, noted the report.
Indonesia and Singapore saw some of the fastest growth among countries in the region, clocking 46% and 45% year-on-year growth in online shopping,¬†respectively.
Shopee was the undisputed winner among shopping apps in the region in terms of monthly active users, followed by Lazada and Taobao. India-based Flipkart and Meesho made it to the top five most downloaded apps in Singapore.

Hello reader,
I‚Äôve always thought that the smartest tech businesses are the ones that play a foundational and enabling role in a sector. Be that platform which everything else has to be built on, and you become indispensable, right? Just think about platforms like Amazon Web Services or even Apple and all the apps and businesses that rely on them.
But of course, that‚Äôs easier said than done. In today‚Äôs premium article, we dive into the story of Polygon and see if it has what it takes to be at the center of the next wave of foundational tech: Web3.
Today we look at:

How Polygon is leading the charge to put India on the global blockchain map

Does the future of Web3 lie in India?

Image credit: Timmy Loen

You might have noticed by now that I occasionally semi-force a reference to basketball and the team I support ‚Äì the Dallas Mavericks ‚Äì into these newsletters.
Well, I don‚Äôt even really have to try this time: Polygon came into the spotlight last May when it received an investment from American billionaire Mark Cuban, who‚Äôs also the owner of the Mavericks.
I‚Äôve actually been fairly critical of how Cuban‚Äôs been running the team these past few years, but I can‚Äôt argue much with his business acumen ‚Äì Polygon may be onto something here.


From the bottom: Polygon‚Äôs early days saw its founders struggle to raise funds. On many occasions, the company had only enough money to pay one or two months‚Äô worth of salaries.


A foundational enabler: The firm wants to be the Amazon Web Services for Web3. Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal believes that developers will pick Polygon over Ethereum for building decentralized apps, as the former is far more scalable.


Home-ground advantage: India is ripe for investments and startups to flourish, and it also has the largest base of developers globally. The current explosion of Web3 projects is perfect for Polygon, which relies on the support of blockchain developers to succeed. In comparison with its rivals, the company is well-positioned to tap into what the country‚Äôs Web3 ecosystem has to offer.

Startup spotlight
Self-driving into US$188 million

Image credit: Timmy Loen

Hong Kong-based Inceptio Technology, a startup developing self-driving trucks, has raised US$188 million in a series B+ equity financing round led by Sequoia Capital China and Legend Capital.


Autobots, roll out: Inceptio offers autonomous-driving tech for trucks and operates a nationwide transportation-as-a-service freight network. It works with players in the automotive industry by preloading its offerings and systems into mass-produced autonomous trucks.


Taking it up a level: At the end of 2021, Inceptio said it was able to mass produce Level 3 autonomous-driving trucks. Level 3 means that a vehicle can fully take over all driving tasks, but drivers still need to pay constant attention to the road and keep their hands near their steering wheels.


Eye on the prize: Julian Ma, the founder and CEO of Inceptio, said that the startup will keep its focus on full-stack independent development and center its tech around mass producing units.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Democratizing Indonesian agriculture
Indonesia-based Agriaku, an agritech startup, has raised US$6 million in a pre-series A round led by Go-Ventures, the VC arm of Gojek.
The startup plans to use the fresh capital to hire new talent in areas such as operations, supply chain, product, and technology. It also aims to strengthen the market presence of its B2B marketplace in the country.
2Ô∏è‚É£ In deep waters
Sea Group dropped its market value by US$10.4 billion after the company posted its quarterly results. The firm has so far trimmed US$127 billion in market value from its peak last November.
The decline in market value comes after Sea cut its year-on-year booking guidance for its digital entertainment unit Garena for the first time. The company cited ‚Äúunanticipated government actions‚Äù in India as one of the reasons for the decline in its digital entertainment unit forecast.
3Ô∏è‚É£ No comrade here
Hong Kong-based Animoca Brands, a blockchain gaming unicorn, has halted its services in Russia to comply with sanctions placed against the country over its invasion of Ukraine.
The move is part of a wide-ranging retreat of firms from Russia amid broad international condemnation of President Vladimir Putin‚Äôs decision to wage war in Ukraine. Animoca‚Äôs move makes the company stand out among major crypto firms like Binance and Kraken, which have continued to serve Russian users.

735791,2022-03-04T07:04:28,"Exclusive: Ecommerce enabler Zaapi bags $4m seed round led by Flourish Ventures, GFC, Partech","Zaapi, a new ecommerce enabler targeting Southeast Asia‚Äôs small businesses, has raised a US$4 million seed round led by Flourish Ventures, Global Founders Capital, and Partech.
The round also saw participation from 1982 Ventures, Kaya Founders, Iterative, XA Network, and Sketchnote Partners.
The new funding follows the company‚Äôs US$500,000 pre-seed round, which was backed by Flash Ventures and was raised in March 2021. The previous round enabled the company to launch in Thailand ‚Äì its first market ‚Äì five months later, where it is currently serving 10,000 merchants across more than 70 cities.

The Zaapi team / Photo credit: Zaapi

Though registered in Singapore, Zaapi says most of its resources is in Thailand, with its team operating remotely.
The company says it will use the fresh capital to scale its product and tech team in the first half of the year before growing its commercial team in the second half of 2022. While the firm looks to gain a strong foothold in Thailand, the company says it may expand to a second market by the end of the year.
‚ÄúOther companies have the tendency to put numbers and growth ahead of the product considerations. We want to make sure we don‚Äôt make that mistake,‚Äù says Zaapi co-founder and CEO Wilfried Buiron in an exclusive conversation with Tech in Asia.
Currently, Zaapi has a mobile app that enables merchants to create an online store and start selling within seconds. It also provides features such as inventory management, discount management, customer relationship management, and payment integrations.
Moving forward, the company will also develop activation tools for small businesses to acquire customers and traffic. This will include social commerce features like live commerce and chat commerce.
Ideal entry point
The vision for Zaapi, Buiron says, is to eventually become a full-stack digital solution for small businesses across Southeast Asia.
To achieve this end goal, picking the right starting point is key. And Buiron, who also owns a direct-to-consumer brand, is confident that he has chosen a strategic point of entry, both in the company‚Äôs sector as well as the geography it operates in.
Observing the strategies for regional and global peers, Buiron says that there are broadly three approaches to accessing the MSME market. One is the B2B procurement model championed by the likes of Udaan (India) and Ula (Indonesia). Another is the bookkeeping model employed by Khatabook (India) and BukuWarung (Indonesia), while the third is the approach of Shopify or India‚Äôs Dukaan, which helps offline merchants sell their products online.
Zaapi has chosen the same model as Dukaan, whose co-founder invested in Zaapi‚Äôs seed round. This decision, Buiron says, was largely spurred on by the advent of Covid-19, which has made the historically ‚Äúchallenging sell‚Äù of selling products online easier for small businesses in Southeast Asia.
‚ÄúIt is a use case that is extremely timely and one that has proven itself across all markets in the world who are ahead of Southeast Asia when it comes to ecommerce,‚Äù he says.
Buiron acknowledges that he is not the first in the region to tap into this opportunity. In Indonesia, for example, BukuWarung and fellow MSME online ledger startup BukuKas have rolled out their ecommerce enabler solutions, while in Vietnam, seed-stage startup SoBangHan has also launched a similar product.

However, Zaapi‚Äôs laser focus on small businesses will hold it in good stead amid regional competition, Buiron says. The company intends to ‚Äúgo much deeper‚Äù than other players ‚Äì many of them treating ecommerce enablement merely as a small part of their large suite of products.
Additionally, Buiron believes Zaapi will also benefit from its decision to turn to Thailand as its launchpad. Many other startups have gone to Indonesia, the region‚Äôs largest market, to kick off their businesses.
Thailand is not only Southeast Asia‚Äôs second-largest ecommerce market, but it is also a relatively wealthy country, which bodes well for Zaapi‚Äôs basket size and margins. It is also a market where competition is ‚Äúscaled back,‚Äù with few challengers in the ecommerce enablement scene.
‚ÄúIt should also be noted that Thailand was the first market for Lazada and Zilingo. So there is a history of ecommerce startups launching in Thailand and doing very well,‚Äù Buiron says.",Ardi Wirdana,Putra Muskita and Jaclyn Tiu ,1,"['Ecommerce', 'Investments', 'News', 'Premium Content', 'Startups']",True,True,3

Docsumo helps businesses make automated decisions from unstructured documents. It can document, validate, and analyze data from paperwork such as financial statements, tax returns, and insurance policies.
The company was founded in 2019 by CEO Rushabh Sheth and CTO¬†Bikram Dahal. It has teams in India and Nepal, with plans of entering the North American market.
‚ÄúWhat differentiates Docsumo is that the technology can accurately extract data from business documents with a high degree of structural variability, and automate decisioning workflows end-to-end,‚Äù said Sheth.
With the fresh funds, Docsumo aims to increase its use cases for automated document analysis such as customer onboarding, income verification, financial fraud detection, and data for underwriting.

735701,2022-03-04T05:00:45,The quiet rise of a startup that sold $2.5m of virtual land,"Josh Settle‚Äôs soon-to-be-launched store is listed online as an art gallery, but he sees it as more than that.
‚ÄúIt could be a space for events and a conference room. It could have a recording studio for podcasts or music. I‚Äôm also trying to get a film theater placed in the store,‚Äù says Settle, an IT professional based in Okinawa.
Settle‚Äôs store is in the metaverse. After getting access to it this February, he regularly pops into alternate reality to walk into his shop or to take a stroll around it to admire the scenery.
His shop has the distinction of being the very first store in the art quarter of the RFox Valt, a metaverse built by Vietnam-headquartered company RFox (formerly known as RedFox Labs).

Brian Cu, co-founder of transportation firm Byahe and the former country president of Grab Philippines, says the metaverse company ‚Äúhas been under the radar.‚Äù Cu is an advisor for RFox, which was launched in 2018.
One reason the metaverse firm has been out of the media spotlight, he says, is because it was launched right before the crypto boom.
This is likely to change soon considering RFox is opening its immersive retail and entertainment-centric metaverse to the public sometime ‚Äúin the middle of this year,‚Äù says its founder Ben Fairbank.
RFox aims to tackle all forms of the metaverse by plugging in stand-alone ‚Äúmoving parts‚Äù into the Valt and having a focus on gaming, finance, and media, says Fairbank.
Enter stage left
By 2026, 25% of people will spend at least one hour a day in the metaverse for work, shopping, education, social, and/or entertainment purposes, says Gartner in a recent report.
It‚Äôs no wonder companies want to cash in.
So at a time when firms like Meta, The Sandbox, and Zepeto are building their metaverses, RFox has set itself apart by fitting the classic definition of a metaverse, says Fairbank.
A metaverse has to be interoperable, immersive, and interconnected, he says. ‚ÄúI think of it as a big box with hooks, and anyone can plug any application, any blockchain, into the box. That‚Äôs how we‚Äôve built RFox.‚Äù
The company has a VR-first approach to the metaverse, which fits the original design of the concept. The non-VR version of the Valt will be rolled out by the third quarter of this year.
But RFox has stiff competition in the space. For instance, Forever 21‚Äôs virtual store on Roblox has seen 200,000 users since its launch in December 2021. Roblox, which has minigames and digital hangouts in its virtual world, has 55 million active users every day.

Many companies are in the metaverse ecosystem, ‚Äúbut they are not at the center of it. RFox is,‚Äù says Cu, who knows Fairbank from his days at Grab.
Plug and play
Valt, which will be launched soon, is a global metaverse. Fairbank says the plan is to create localized Valts next, starting with the Philippines later this year and then moving on to Vietnam and Indonesia.
These worlds ‚Äì either those that are open worldwide or the ones customized by geography ‚Äì may look largely similar, but the main difference is that the food courts, clothing businesses, and billboard advertisements will be locally influenced.
Including the RFox Valt, there are five parts of the RFox ecosystem. The most recently launched is its white-label platform, RFox NFTs, which helps businesses set up a presence in the metaverse and the Web 3 ecosystem.
‚ÄúI speak with at least 15 to 18 companies every week,‚Äù says Fairbank. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve all been given a mandate for a Web3 or a metaverse strategy for the year, but most companies don‚Äôt know how to get involved in the space.‚Äù
RFox also has a decentralized finance arm, RFox Finance, which offers staking and farming features to holders of its tokens.
RFox Games, meanwhile, issues keys to other games (KOGS). These are collectible, playable, and tradeable NFTs (non-fungible tokens) that can act as in-game currency, unlock tournaments and skins, and double as tickets to special events. While RFox plans to collaborate with other gaming companies in the future, its own play-to-earn game, KOGs Slam, is already available in 175 countries in beta.
Notably, RFox also launched a ‚Äúplay-to-eat‚Äù game in Myanmar together with food delivery firm Foodpanda after realizing that the Myanmar government wasn‚Äôt receptive to crypto products. The initiative rewards food vouchers to people for playing a game, and Fairbank says the firm is looking to launch it in the Philippines next.
While the play-to-eat model is not a moneymaker, it does help with building a positive image for RFox, says the founder.

The company also has RFox Media, which will eventually offer services like advertising and marketing.
The unit will also have a streaming component that looks like YouTube, but the founder says RFox is ‚Äúchanging the way the content is distributed.‚Äù The company has tied up with ‚Äúhuge distribution media companies,‚Äù says Fairbank, and the streaming feature will operate on a create-to-earn model, where content creators can directly upload to RFox TV and have purchases governed by smart contracts.
RFox Media was formed after the metaverse firm acquired MyMedia Digital, a digital marketing platform in Myanmar that has worked with companies like Samsung, Huawei, Nestle, Lenovo, Grab, Oppo, and Vivo.
It‚Äôs easy to see why Fairbank talks so often about moving pieces that are waiting for the right time to click together ‚Äì it seems to be the company‚Äôs go-to strategy. For instance, RFox has a tie-up with Lazada Philippines for cashback and rewards that will go live once the Valt is open.
Lazada and RFox have partnered up for ecommerce livestreaming, where Lazada will offer 8% to RFox for every purchase through the livestream content. RFox will give 7% to the buyer in the form of the company‚Äôs token currency and keep 1% as a referral fee. This fee can also be passed on to the customer if they bring in another user.
The metaverse firm‚Äôs goal is to launch the first-ever ecommerce livestreaming cashback app on the blockchain.
Whole is greater than the sum
The Valt aims to attract traffic. By doing so, businesses that set up shop in its virtual world won‚Äôt need to worry about building an audience from scratch, says Fairbank.
These companies can also expand into countries without worrying about regulations. In some cases, like the Philippines, a foreign business can‚Äôt invest in certain sectors such as mass media, where at least 60% of the business has to be held by a Filipino citizen. But virtual real estate solves that if a company has a supply chain partner on the ground in the Philippines.
The Valt itself has four quarters, and auctions for two of these areas ‚Äì the art-focused quarter Callinova and gaming district Arkamoto ‚Äì are already over.
Shop auctions in the Callinova quarter brought in a total of 29.5 million rfox(the transactional currency for in-Valt purchases) or about US$1.3 million. The gaming quarter auctions brought in a total of 291 ETH (about US$1.2 million) in December.
The company‚Äôs second token is VFox, a rewards currency that earns holders a percentage of all Valt transactions.
Currently, the Valt‚Äôs marquee clients include cryptocurrency data aggregator CoinGecko, aggregator chain Icon, and gaming guild Yield Guild Games.
The company has also collaborated with Reebok and Miss Universe Philippines for their NFT projects.
The long game
Byahe‚Äôs Cu agrees that RFox‚Äôs plans are ambitious to say the least. For one, the company has to vie for attention against a multitude of metaverse contenders. Virtual reality might also take a while to go mainstream (if it does), especially in countries with poor internet connectivity.
‚ÄúBut if I trust someone to get it done, it‚Äôd be Ben,‚Äù Cu says.
For now, though, RFox isn‚Äôt looking for VC funding. Fairbank has his reasons to hold off, as RFox has a runway for a few years. ‚ÄúPeople say it‚Äôs madness, but we‚Äôve bootstrapped from the beginning,‚Äù says Fairbank, who adds that RFox gets offered VC funding ‚Äúall the time.‚Äù

Besides, investors would want the company to follow a playbook that others in the market are already sticking to.
‚ÄúMost of the VCs that we talked to say, ‚ÄòWhy don‚Äôt you just do games and concentrate on one thing and become really good at it?‚Äô They don‚Äôt understand the opportunity of building a platform for Web3,‚Äù says Fairbank.
And now that Meta has announced its plans, Fairbank says there‚Äôs a race to see which is the first metaverse company to go public. But an IPO doesn‚Äôt have the same appeal it once used to, he adds.
See also: Are SEA‚Äôs tech VCs missing out on the crypto craze?
Instead, Fairbank says the company is looking for people who can bring value to the company regarding networking or partnerships. ‚ÄúWe have no debt, we own 100% of the equity,‚Äù says Fairbank, adding that this makes RFox a good acquisition target.
Meanwhile, as companies dream about the possibilities of virtual worlds, metaverse store owner Settle says his family looks at him like he‚Äôs ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù for having paid the equivalent of US$122,000 to buy a virtual shop.

The Singapore-based super app ended the March 3 trading day at US$3.28, which was 37% lower than its opening price of US$5.21 for the day. Its market price is now almost a quarter of its initial IPO price of US$11.01.
Grab‚Äôs market cap now stands at US$12.3 billion, which is well below 3x its US$40 billion valuation during its listing. Its market cap is now also below the company‚Äôs reported US$14 billion valuation during its series H round in 2019.
While Grab‚Äôs market cap was already half of its IPO valuation before the results announcement, at US$19.5 billion, the poor quarterly results in Q4 has dragged its valuation down even further.
The development comes as hits in Grab‚Äôs mobility segment as well as its enterprise and new initiatives segment beat down on its revenue for the fourth quarter. The ride-hailing giant‚Äôs total adjusted quarterly operating loss also widened more than 2x to US$557 million.
Meanwhile, its revenue for the full year 2021 was up 44% at US$675 million, while total losses for the year rose by 30% to over US$3.5 billion.

According to a disclosure to the Indonesia Stock Exchange, DSST will become one of the largest shareholders of Dana after the deal. The process is pending agreement on some closing conditions and approvals from regulators.
Launched in 2018, Dana is also backed by Chinese payments giant Ant Financial. The Indonesian firm‚Äôs founder and CEO, Vincent Henry Iswaratioso, previously worked as the Indonesian country head for Alipay.
Before launching Dana, Emtek Group acquired e-wallet developer Espay and payment gateway Doku, which both provided infrastructure and an e-money license to the media conglomerate.
Currently, Dana is one of the largest e-wallet services in the country in terms of monthly active users, competing with the likes of GoPay, Ovo, and ShopeePay.

735645,2022-03-03T13:53:31,Grab‚Äôs revenue falls by 44% in Q4 on downturn in mobility business,"Singapore-based super app Grab saw its revenue plunge by over 44% to US$122 million in the fourth quarter ended December 2021. This was mainly due to a downturn in its mobility and enterprise and new initiatives segments.
The company attributed this to higher consumer incentives for mobility and deliveries, as it invested in its category share and monthly transacting users (MTU) growth. While Grab‚Äôs consumer incentives soared by 126% to US$365 million in Q4 2021, partner incentives climbed 74% to US$218 million during the same quarter from a year earlier.
Grab‚Äôs revenue is gross billings, which grew quarter-on-quarter, less driver and merchant incentives.

In Q4 2021, revenue from Grab‚Äôs mobility business shrank by about 27% to US$105 million, as the company invested more in driver incentives. The segment‚Äôs gross merchandise value (GMV) also fell by 14% from a year ago to US$2.8 billion in the quarter, while its adjusted EBITDA narrowed by 32% to US$76 million in Q4.
Meanwhile, its revenue for the full year was at US$675 million¬†‚Äì a 44% boost ‚Äì while GMVs went up 29% to US$16.06 billion.
Grab‚Äôs total adjusted operating loss for the quarter widened more than 2x to US$557 million from US$234 million last year. Monthly transacting users also saw a 2% decrease.
The company‚Äôs total loss for the period was at US$1.1 billion, expanding by 73%. However, this includes a US$311 million non-cash interest expense related to Grab‚Äôs convertible shares that ceased upon its listing. For the full year, the company‚Äôs loss rose by 30% to US$3.55 billion.
See also: Grab‚Äôs financial health in 8 charts
Grab posted a total GMV of US$4.5 billion in Q4 2021, representing a 26% increase.
The deliveries segment, which includes GrabMart and GrabExpress, saw its GMV jump 52% to hit US$2.4 billion in the quarter, a new record high. The segment‚Äôs EBITDA losses surged by 42x to US$84 million, from just US$2 million in the same quarter a year ago.
Meanwhile, Grab‚Äôs financial services business posted total payments volume of US$12.1 billion, growing by 37%. EBITDA losses for the segment stood at US$110 million, widening by 34% in Q4 2020.

Hello reader,
When I was younger, I religiously watched Dragon Ball Z, the Japanese anime. There‚Äôs one thing about the show that I like to think of whenever I come across a merger of companies: It‚Äôs called ‚Äúfusion‚Äù and it literally refers to two characters merging their bodies to defeat a more powerful enemy. The message was clear even to a young boy: The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.
That also applies to two Indonesia-based startups that recently merged to create Quipster. In today‚Äôs story, we take a look at how this merger came about and what it means for the two firms.
Today we look at:

What a merger holds for Indonesia-based Webtrace and TraktorHub 
What a Shopify-like Vietnamese startup plans to do with its new capital 
Other newsy highlights such as AirAsia‚Äôs new financial marketplace in Indonesia and a US$200 million investment in Indonesian e-wallet Dana.

Finding friends

Image credit: Timmy Loen

Webtrace and TraktorHub have merged to form a new entity, Quipster. The move is not surprising one as the synergy between both firms is apparent: Webtrace provides an IoT solution to help companies monitor their vehicle assets, while TraktorHub‚Äôs platform helps companies rent or buy heavy equipment.


Sorting out who‚Äôs who:  While both companies now operate under the Quipster banner, they will both continue serving their respective customers with Quipster acting as a holding entity. Webtrace‚Äôs co-founders, Erwin Subroto and Denny Tijioe, will serve as CEO and CFO of Quipster, respectively, while TraktorHub‚Äôs co-founder David Hartono will be COO of the merged entity.


Mutual friends:  According to Subroto, the two companies first met via their common investor, Prasetia Dwidharma. What was initially meant to be a discussion for collaboration eventually snowballed once both firms realized that some of their founders knew each other. That was when they decided to pull the trigger and turn a partnership into a strategic merger.


Fuel in the tank: Following the merger, Quipster intends to raise a pre-series A round later this year. Using those funds, the company plans to further its expansion to 12 cities in Indonesia. It‚Äôs also looking to build new products and forge partnerships with financial firms to offer loans or insurance services.

Although SoBanHang means ‚Äúsales book‚Äù in Vietnamese, its founder, Bui Hai Nam, is looking to turn it into more than just a bookkeeping app. Fortunately, he‚Äôs off to a good start as SoBanHang recently raised US$2.5 million in funding, taking its total funds raised to US$4 million.


Under the microscope: There‚Äôs a wave of startups in Vietnam that want to digitalize small businesses and retailers, but SoBanHang has an even sharper focus: the ‚Äúnano and micro segment,‚Äù which includes household businesses or solo sellers that cannot afford to invest in point-of-sale software and other online infrastructure.


Small businesses, big troubles: One of the key issues faced by these small businesses ‚Äì which Nam estimates to number around 16 million in Vietnam ‚Äì is that many of them have trouble taking their businesses online. According to Nam, this got even worse with the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.


Filling the gap: With SoBanHang‚Äôs app, retailers can build an online store, create promotions, manage inventory, and track in-store sales and information about loyal customers. The best part? It‚Äôs currently free, although the firm plans to introduce a subscription model soon.

735622,2022-03-03T08:43:29,"Sea‚Äôs new results disappoint, but offer tantalizing morsels","Sea‚Äôs fourth quarter and full year 2021 results were released on Tuesday, and three key things stood out.
But first, it‚Äôs important to understand the backdrop. Much has transpired since November 2021, when Sea last announced Q3 results.
Back then, its share price was a lofty US$330. But it had plummeted to US$145 a day before Q4 numbers came out.

Image credit: Tech in Asia

To be fair, many other tech companies ‚Äì especially unprofitable ones ‚Äì have been caught in the same maelstrom, which started when Jerome Powell, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, pivoted to a more hawkish position on inflation, raising the prospect of faster than expected interest rate hikes.
However, company-specific factors were also at play for Sea.
Free Fire, the flagship game of Sea‚Äôs digital entertainment unit Garena, was banned in India over national security concerns tied to Chinese apps, even though it is produced by a Singapore company. This cut the game‚Äôs access to a large market with massive potential for growth.
Some analysts have also pointed out other issues, such as the impact of Garena‚Äôs slowing growth on Sea‚Äôs wider prospects and the long-term sustainability of ecommerce unit Shopee‚Äôs business model.
Stormy seas for Garena
Indeed, Garena‚Äôs Q4 results were not pretty.
Bookings, an operational metric that Sea uses to approximate cash spent by its users, came in at US$1.1 billion. This was not merely a case of lagging growth ‚Äì it‚Äôs a decline from US$1.2 billion in Q3.
Quarterly active users (QAU) and quarterly paying users (QPU) also fell from the previous quarter by 10% and 17%, respectively.
Significantly, this is the first time since Sea‚Äôs IPO in 2017 that QAU has declined, and the first for bookings and QPU since the second quarter of 2018.
The near-term outlook isn‚Äôt any rosier.
Sea expects bookings of US$3 billion in 2022. This figure is around what the company achieved in 2020 and a third less than what it generated in 2021.
The company attributes this setback to a slowdown in online activities as economies reopen amid the easing of the pandemic, and the ban on Free Fire in India.
Given that Garena has been serving as a cash cow to fund Sea‚Äôs other businesses, investors are rightly concerned about the impact of any slump there. They didn‚Äôt react well to the results and guidance, sending Sea‚Äôs shares plunging 13% by the close of trading.
While Sea said it was ‚Äúworking on multiple prototype games across different genres and stages,‚Äù these will take some time to monetize, and there is no guarantee that its initiatives will succeed.
Of course, the business is still profitable ‚Äì adjusted EBITDA for the year was US$2.8 billion. The Singapore government has also reached out to its Indian counterpart regarding the ban, raising the fact that Sea Group is Singaporean. A resolution of this issue in Garena‚Äôs favor would certainly ease the headwinds it faces.
Shopee‚Äôs new deadline for profitability
Forrest Li, Sea‚Äôs chairman and group CEO, was undoubtedly aware of investor concerns over profitability, especially as Shopee incurs rising costs from its expansion into new markets like Latin America and Europe.
Li kicked off the earnings call by emphasizing Sea‚Äôs plan to achieve ‚Äúsustainable growth.‚Äù He also shared that Shopee was expected to reach positive adjusted EBITDA (before the allocation of headquarter costs) in Southeast Asia and Taiwan by this year.
Numbers were provided to support this: Shopee‚Äôs EBITDA loss per order for these markets was 15 cents in Q4 2021 compared to 42 cents for the wider business. This is also an improvement from a loss of 21 cents a year earlier.
Similarly, Li said that SeaMoney was expected to achieve positive cash flow by 2023.
The message was clear. Shopee and SeaMoney‚Äôs core markets provide a strong foundation that can support further expansion, with the ability to ‚Äúself-fund their own long-term growth‚Äù by 2025.
Jittery investors should welcome clarity on Sea‚Äôs path to profitability as it gives them a timeline to hold management to. Assuming these projections hold, they will be a riposte to those who doubt the long-term sustainability of an ecommerce business in Southeast Asia.
Brazil a ‚Äúnew growth market‚Äù
While some investors want to see a path to profitability, many still demand robust revenue growth, which requires investment and may reduce short-term profit.
Sea had something to entice them, too.
The company has traditionally been rather cagey about its Brazil business, declining to go into specifics and emphasizing that things were at a ‚Äúvery early stage‚Äù when asked about it.
See also: Brazil could become Shopee‚Äôs biggest market, beating even Indonesia
However, as 2021 progressed, Brazil was brought up more often. Li talked about it only once in the earnings call for Q1 2021, twice in the second, and five times in the third.
The country merited 13 mentions on Tuesday, in enthusiastic language.
Li described Brazil as Sea‚Äôs ‚Äúnew growth market,‚Äùadding how the company is ‚Äúvery excited about its growth prospects.‚Äù
In fact, Shopee‚Äôs Latin America business ‚Äì particularly Brazil ‚Äì was highlighted as one of the company‚Äôs ‚Äútop two focus areas for investment,‚Äùalong with research and development.
Li tantalized investors by sharing more numbers. In Q4, Shopee Brazil recorded over 140 million gross orders ‚Äì up 400% year on year ‚Äì and enjoyed more than US$70 million in revenue.
In terms of gross orders, Shopee‚Äôs Brazil business is around the same size as Shopee was in Indonesia in Q3 2019. Brazil has a population of 200 million, the sixth largest in the world, so it could certainly provide Shopee with room for further growth in the years ahead.
Its app is performing well in Latin America and India, in terms of active users and app downloads.

However, the picture in Europe is mixed. Shopee has yet to enter the top 10 by active users rankings in any of the three European markets. But it was the most-downloaded app in Spain and Poland, which may generate more active users going forward.
The same cannot be said for France, though. Perhaps this was one of the factors behind Shopee‚Äôs decision to shut its operations there.
Sea has often touted its ‚Äúdisciplined and open-minded‚Äù approach when deciding where to invest. Ending its French operations suggests that the company is not sentimental about underperforming businesses, and investors should welcome this attitude.",Simon Huang,Edited by Terence Lee and Eileen C.

THE HOT TAKEByteDance‚Äôs ecommerce play

Here‚Äôs what happened:

TikTok Shop, the ecommerce arm of TikTok, has launched in Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia.
It was introduced in Indonesia and the UK last year.
TikTok‚Äôs ecommerce GMV reached US$951 million in 2021.

Here‚Äôs our take:
Last week, The Checkout analyzed why ByteDance shut down its Shein clone, Dmonstudio. There‚Äôs been major developments on ByteDance‚Äôs ecommerce side since then.
For one, TikTok Shop, which allows creators and brands to sell products directly to consumers through the app, is rapidly expanding across Southeast Asia and has ramped up hiring in Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia.
In 2021, TikTok‚Äôs ecommerce GMV totaled 6 billion yuan (US$951 million), which is only about 1% of China-only counterpart Douyin‚Äôs GMV for the year.
But for 2022, TikTok is looking at nearly 12 billion yuan from its ecommerce unit. It has reasons to be optimistic ‚Äì the year it was established in China, Douyin‚Äôs ecommerce arm saw a GMV of about 500 billion yuan.
Indonesia accounted for at least 70% of TikTok‚Äôs ecommerce GMV. The rest came from the UK, where TikTok Shop has been available since April 2021.
While Douyin and TikTok‚Äôs parent ByteDance keeps its fingers crossed, it knows that livestreaming and social commerce play up to its strengths.
In 2021, over 1.4 million social media conversations around livestream shopping took place in Southeast Asia, about 2x more than the same time a year before, according to a report from Meltwater. The media monitoring platform also found that Sea Group‚Äôs Shopee posted a 2.5x increase in annual livestream viewership on its platform.

ByteDance has been paying close attention to these trends. Last year, Douyin held a series of offline events in China to attract merchants, with executives describing the app‚Äôs 600 million daily active users as ‚Äúvery sticky.‚Äù The push also coincided with the rollout of payment service Douyin Pay.
The timing is crucial: ByteDance‚Äôs ecommerce play comes as China‚Äôs government continues to keep a close watch on tech companies for a variety of reasons, including monopolistic behavior. This makes room for others to grow.
Getting into ecommerce also means that TikTok‚Äôs parent company considers itself a strong challenger to Chinese giants like Pinduoduo, JD.com, and Alibaba. Others feel that the tide might be turning as well.
Following Alibaba‚Äôs recent results, an analyst told the Financial Times that ‚Äúthe hit from Douyin and Kuaishou livestreaming ecommerce has been huge‚Äâ‚Ä¶‚ÄâTaobao livestreaming can‚Äôt compete.‚Äù Kuaishou is a¬† Douyin rival while Taobao is a C2C and B2C shopping marketplace operated by Alibaba.
TikTok‚Äôs popularity has spilled over to its ecommerce business and it shows. #TikTokMadeMeBuyIt is so catchy that BuzzFeed came out with several articles dedicated to the hashtag.
Once a Chinese phenomenon, livestreamed shopping has gone global and is fast becoming the modern-day version of teleshopping. So much so that Canadian TikToker Lisa Couture had to temporarily close her candy store to fulfill the hundreds of orders that flooded in after her video went viral.
Analysts also think that it‚Äôs only a matter of time before Chinese sellers will have access to the wider world through TikTok, which is expected to be ‚Äúfriendlier‚Äù to them than Amazon has been.
Besides algorithms and resources, there‚Äôs another element at work in the social commerce game: the human factor.
The popularity of TikTok Shop also depends on its roster of livestreaming stars. China‚Äôs Li Jiaqi or Lipstick Brother, who sold US$2 billion in goods in a single day on Alibaba, is a good example of the competition that ByteDance faces.
It‚Äôs possible that with the now-defunct Dmonstudio, ByteDance could have had some control over the quality of select merchandise. But that‚Äôs not possible with a livestreaming model where the company has less control over the merchants on its platform.
Take ByteDance‚Äôs Fanno, for instance. Much like Shopee‚Äôs problems in India, the quality of products is reportedly a hit or miss on Fanno in Europe.
ByteDance likely expects so much more from TikTok Shop than from Fanno. After all, TikTok already has a captive audience ripe for a livestreaming harvest.

735431,2022-03-03T05:00:00,How Polygon puts India at the heart of the crypto world,"Polygon is an India-based company that enables the Ethereum blockchain to handle many more transactions than the latter was originally designed to. Polygon came into the spotlight last May when it received an investment from American billionaire Mark Cuban.

Formerly known as Matic, the Mumbai-based company is ‚Äúdestroying everybody else‚Äù in the crypto space, Cuban declared at a panel discussion a month after his investment.
Cuban‚Äôs bullish bet on Polygon came months before interest around Web3 and blockchain peaked among the masses.
Polygon has found itself ahead of the curve and leading the charge to put India on the global blockchain map.
Last month, the firm raised US$450 million in a strategic raise led by Sequoia Capital India, with Softbank Vision Fund 2 participating. Its relatively long line of investors also included Cuban‚Äôs Shark Tank colleague, Kevin O‚ÄôLeary.
What makes Polygon so hot
Polygon‚Äôs mission is clear: It wants to be the Amazon Web Services for Web3. Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal expects developers will pick Polygon over Ethereum for building decentralized apps (dApps) as the former is far more scalable.
This advantage could turn Polygon into the biggest name in the crypto space after Bitcoin and Ethereum, Nailwal tells Tech in Asia.
Polygon‚Äôs confidence rests in its layer 2 scaling solutions, which serve as an intermediary between Ethereum and dApp creators. It speeds up blockchain transactions by processing them on ‚Äúside-chains,‚Äù taking pressure off the main blockchain.
At the same time, Polygon‚Äôs solution allows developers to build user-friendly dApps while staying within the familiar Ethereum ecosystem.
In doing so, the company is countering the slow speeds and high transaction costs that have plagued blockchain users over the years, even as it benefits from Ethereum being the first popular smart-contract blockchain.
Polygon is a collection of technologies. ‚ÄúIt calls itself an Ethereum scalability solutions aggregator. The idea is that developers can choose the solution that works for them, rather than being presented with a one-size-fits-all route,‚Äù Manan Shah, CEO and founder of cybersecurity firm Avalance Global Solutions, tells Tech in Asia.

Polygon developers can prioritize higher speeds, more security, or low transaction costs. This means Polygon can be used across both decentralized finance (DeFi) and gaming, which have different requirements, according to Sagar Garg, a blockchain consultant and ex-Mobile Premier League product manager.
Over the past year, Polygon has bagged quite a few big projects in Web3 from the likes of DeFi protocols Aave and Uniswap, metaverse platform Sandbox, and NFT marketplaces like OpenSea and Cuban‚Äôs Lazy.com.
More than 7,000 dApps are currently being built on the Polygon blockchain, making it one of the largest dApps platforms in the world.
The adoption of Polygon‚Äôs proof of stake protocol has also jumped exponentially, clocking nearly a billion transactions in 2021. Over 2.67 million monthly active users on Polygon generate about 3 million transactions per day ‚Äì almost 2x the volume on Ethereum.
That‚Äôs why Polygon‚Äôs native Matic token enjoys a market value of around US$11 billion.

Polygon‚Äôs next big bet is zero-knowledge (ZK) roll-ups, which promise even faster transaction speeds than its optimistic rollups, which it currently uses.
Under its Polygon Zero initiative, it has made a few big investments. In December 2021, it acquired Mir, a ZK tech startup, in a US$400 million deal.
Polygon is also investing in projects at the intersection of social media and Web3 via a US$200 million initiative in partnership with Seven Seven Six, a VC firm owned by Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian.
Ohanian said Seven Seven Six will look for opportunities in the gaming and social media spaces, leveraging Polygon‚Äôs scalable infrastructure. The VC holds a diverse portfolio of Web3 projects, including Sky Mavis, maker of the popular blockchain game Axie Infinity.
Polygon also recently invested in Hike, an India-based social media firm that operates play-to-earn platform Rush Gaming Universe.
Nailwal says these firms fit into Polygon‚Äôs 10-year roadmap. Some of them may bear fruit within 12 months while some of its other efforts may become prominent in the next three to five years, he added.
Humble beginnings
Polygon‚Äôs journey so far, however, has been an uphill battle.
In 2015, Sandeep Nailwal was running a B2B marketplace. While there, he caught the crypto bug and realized that decentralized networks had uses beyond cryptocurrencies.
Nailwal used his programming expertise to code a few dApps for clients. Following some success, he took it up as a full-time job.
Around the time, Nailwal got in touch with Jaynti Kanani, who had quit his job as a data scientist at Housing.com. Nailwal also saw some of the proofs of concept of his projects and apps, based on a ‚Äúplasma‚Äù framework that Kanani had developed. Nailwal and Kanani then decided to join hands to build Polygon, before onboarding Anurag Arjun, their third co-founder.
The firm struggled to cope with an unexpected market slump in the initial months after its launch.
It was all the more difficult as not many people believed a team from India could build pathbreaking infrastructure protocols, Nailwal tells Tech in Asia.
Polygon‚Äôs early days also saw its founders struggling to raise funds.
Nailwal adds that the company had to work hard to convince even small-scale investors to back it. The volatility in bitcoin prices also kept investors at bay.
On many occasions, the company had only enough money in store to pay one or two months of salaries, Nailwal says. This forced him to make personal requests from investors to shell out some US$50,000 in emergency funding to keep the firm afloat for another five months.
‚ÄúYou must have heard about Polygon, maybe five or six months ago, when we really exploded in the global space. But we had been grinding our way for the last three years. Nobody had then paid attention,‚Äù he adds.
When some Polygon-based dApps became popular, the firm finally received recognition in India and abroad.

Polygon‚Äôs exponential rise, however, may not go unchallenged. Ethereum itself may be a force to reckon with once it solves its scalability issues, though that may take a while. Vitalik Buterin, the inventor of Ethereum, has called layer 2 solutions the future of his creation‚Äôs efforts to reach scale.
Then there are ‚ÄúEthereum killers‚Äù like Avalanche, Fantom, Solana, and BNB Chain, which provide attractive alternatives to dApp developers.
At the same time, Polygon‚Äôs growing size may mean it could chew more than it can swallow.
Garg notes that Polygon and other networks are working hard to ramp up throughputs and scale, but it may still not be enough to handle heavy traffic. This was recently evident in the Sunflower Farmers game incident, which choked the Polygon network.
The game was designed in a way that as more people joined the game, the supply of its tokens jumped up, and the rewards dropped, Garg said.
This meant that someone playing the game in its early days would receive more rewards for harvesting a sunflower than late joiners, leading to a sort of race. This congested the Polygon network and raised its gas prices.

Setting the stage for India‚Äôs Web3 boom
Polygon could still give India a foothold in the crypto world. Already, there is increasing investor interest in India‚Äôs Web3 space ‚Äì Sequoia Capital India made as many as 19 investments in Web3 startups in the second half of 2021.
‚ÄúThe kind of innovation that we‚Äôre seeing in DeFi is extraordinary,‚Äù Rajan Anandan, managing director of Sequoia Capital said, said in December last year.
‚ÄúA key catalyst for Web3 that we‚Äôll see this year will be the L2 (layer 2)/roll-up ecosystem coming online in a big way,‚Äù Sequoia India managing director Shailesh Lakhani tells Tech in Asia.
Lakhani adds that the ecosystem will help reduce transaction costs substantially and open up Web3 to a number of new applications.
Another top VC that is aggressively chasing Web3 is Antler.
In December 2021, the VC announced that it would allocate one-third of its planned investment in India to blockchain and Web3 projects. It aims to fund up to 30 such early-stage projects in the country in the future. Antler will also expand its India team with blockchain and Web3 specialists to accelerate its investments in the sector.
Nitin Sharma, global blockchain lead at Antler and partner at Antler India, tells Tech in Asia that Web3 and decentralization are among the top priorities for the VC right now.
He believes that India is going to play a huge role in scaling up the Web3 space, given the depth of developer talent in the country.
Sharma adds that Antler has created a one-stop common application for founders ‚Äì especially those making a transition from Web2 to Web3 ‚Äì allowing selected founders to be funded by various local Antler funds, be invited to co-founder matching programs, and be mentored by a special group of Web3 advisors, including several Web3 founders.
Antler has also brought in Polygon, Solana, and Avalanche as ecosystem partners to help new Web3 founders navigate the complex landscape, he added.

Apart from generating investor interest, a few Indian startups are also pushing the needle on what‚Äôs possible in the Web3 space.
Anshul Rustaggi founded Totality Corp in 2019 as a playable Ethereum-based NFT play-to-earn game. The company plans to create collectible and playable NFTs based on Indian mythology. As of December 2021, it has raised US$1.8 million and plans to raise more this year.
Chingari, a short-video app similar to TikTok, is another Indian startup grabbing headlines in the Web3 world. The platform is betting on a social token called $GARI, which can be used for multiple purposes such as for governance, tipping content creators, and buying items like NFTs from its marketplace.
It went live on a dozen crypto exchanges in January. On its inaugural day, the $GARI token‚Äôs market value topped US$100 million.
Besides having a ripe environment for investments and startups, India has another crucial advantage: It also has the largest base of developers globally and is witnessing an explosion in the number of Web3 projects. ‚ÄúIndia and Web3 offers a fertile ground where we will see a number of use cases that are brand new,‚Äù Sequoia‚Äôs Lakhani added.
This would come as music to the ears of Polygon, which relies on the support of blockchain developers to succeed. In comparison with rivals, it‚Äôs well positioned to tap into what the country‚Äôs Web3 ecosystem has to offer.
In the Web2 era, the likes of Zoho and Freshworks have shown how companies born in India can produce world-class products and services.
But if Polygon delivers on its potential, it could do something that‚Äôs never been done before: Place India right at the heart of the next wave of foundational tech ‚Äì a welcome prospect for a company that once struggled to get face time with investors.",Kul Bhushan,,0,"['Analysis', 'Blockchain', 'Premium Content', 'Profiles']",True,True,8

735304,2022-03-03T02:00:47,Here‚Äôs how businesses can stay one step ahead of fraud,"Fraud is on the rise in Southeast Asia. In recent months, 790 customers of Singapore‚Äôs Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation were hit by an SMS phishing scam, resulting in the loss of over S$13.7 million (US$10.2 million).
This incident is just one example of how fraud has evolved in recent years. And fraudsters aren‚Äôt just targeting customers ‚Äì businesses are wrestling with the problem as well. According to Staying Ahead Of The Fight Against Fraud In Southeast Asia, a study commissioned by GrabDefence and conducted by Forrester Consulting, seven out of 10 surveyed businesses said they had experienced fraud in the last twelve months.

Photo credit: fizkes / 123RF

However, the truth is that these developments aren‚Äôt all that surprising. Fraud has been around for as long as there‚Äôs been money to be made, and fraudsters have always sought opportunities to make illegal gains.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the nature of fraud, that it will never go away,‚Äù says Brian Kim, the head of business development and strategy at GrabDefence, Grab‚Äôs B2B enterprise fraud solution business.
Drawing from GrabDefence‚Äôs experience of managing fraud for both Grab and third-party customers, Kim notes that fraudsters are constantly evolving, seeking out new ways to defraud businesses ‚Äì and Southeast Asia has presented plenty of opportunities for fraud.
State of fraud in Southeast Asia
Kim points to the growth of digital services in Southeast Asia as a major driver of fraud in the region. The arrival of new services has led to new opportunities for fraudsters to take advantage of.
For example, new methods of payment such as digital wallets may give fraudsters new avenues to take advantage of, while new services ‚Äì like ride hailing ‚Äì have created new ways for bad actors to defraud businesses.
Southeast Asia‚Äôs competitive tech scene makes matters worse. Both new startups and incumbent organizations are trying to bring customers to their digital services, making signing up and transacting on their platforms as easy as possible. However, that creates problems as well.
‚ÄúYou cannot afford to introduce friction into the customer experience when there‚Äôs such heavy competition for customer acquisition, but in doing so, you leave a lot of doors open for fraudsters,‚Äù says Kim.

Brian Kim, the head of business development and strategy at GrabDefence / Photo credit: GrabDefence

And, of course, Covid-19 has exacerbated the situation as it resulted in a surge in internet users in Southeast Asia.
‚ÄúWith Covid-19, many people are coming online for the first time,‚Äù Kim explains. ‚ÄúThese are people who may have never used a digital platform in their lives, and are unaware of the threats that exist on online platforms, making them more susceptible to fraud.‚Äù
The many faces of fraud
The three most common forms of fraud that businesses face in Southeast Asia are those related to online digital wallets, promotion abuse, and fake reviews and ratings, according to the GrabDefence and Forrester report.
From Kim‚Äôs perspective, these types of fraud are the most common due to the competition among businesses in Southeast Asia.
As firms work to acquire customers, they‚Äôre rolling out a variety of schemes to incentivize consumers to come on board, and looking to make the customer experience as smooth as possible, offering discount codes, sign-up bonuses, and a variety of different payment options. While this is good news for consumers overall, it inevitably creates plenty of opportunities for fraudsters to take advantage of.

Fraud is also costly for businesses. Over 75% of the organizations surveyed in the report said each type of fraud had a moderate or significant financial impact on their organizations, and firms that experienced promotion abuse reported a loss of 31% on average in their annual marketing spend as a result.
However, the total cost of fraud is significantly higher. Besides the financial cost, businesses also have to grapple with other issues such as heightened compliance requirements, damage to brand and reputation, and the impact on customer satisfaction and trust.
‚ÄúAll of these go hand-in-hand ‚Äì you‚Äôll have unhappy customers ringing up your hotline, people will be distrustful of any emails you send or promotions you‚Äôre running,‚Äù says Kim. ‚ÄúYou may need to rework your internal processes constantly, and your costs will definitely go up.‚Äù
The challenges with fraud management
It‚Äôs no surprise that fraud management is a top priority for many companies. Of the organizations surveyed in the report, 82% plan to either set up enterprise fraud management (EFM) solutions or upgrade their existing solutions.
However, neither is easy to do. Businesses have highlighted the impact of implementing EFM solutions on customer experience as one of the top challenges they face ‚Äì something Kim has also observed with GrabDefence‚Äôs customers.
‚ÄúRisk management often comes with increased friction for users, and businesses often struggle to maintain a balance between the two,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAs you tighten your fraud prevention policy, you‚Äôre going to get less fraud. But at the same time, your cost is going to increase because your customer experience will deteriorate, and you might see more false positives.‚Äù
After all, if a customer has to jump through many hoops and know-your-customer processes to create an account, or go through multiple forms of verification to make a simple purchase, they might just take their business elsewhere, leading to a loss for the company.
Aside from balancing customer experience and fraud management, another key difficulty is adapting to the evolving methods of fraud.
‚ÄúFraud is a continuous cat and mouse game,‚Äù Kim says. ‚ÄúWhenever you put a new fraud prevention measure in place, fraudsters find the loophole very quickly ‚Äì they know how to leverage technology to bypass all these measures. Understanding this and future-proofing yourself, is another challenging element.‚Äù
Keeping the fraudsters at bay
To that end, how can businesses ensure they‚Äôre putting the right fraud management solutions in place? Kim‚Äôs advice is to work with a provider that truly understands the problem at hand and can work with your company to provide a solution that balances customer experience and fraud prevention.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not so much about stopping fraud per se, but about making sure you introduce the minimal level of friction into the system and striking that balance,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important to make sure you work with a service provider that has that experience and know-how about how to identify and create this balance.‚Äù
Additionally, firms need to have the right mindset to tackle fraud.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a one-off thing,‚Äù Kim says. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt just say we‚Äôve found the balance, we‚Äôve implemented this, and that‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs something that continuously evolves, and the optimal level will change as new fraud types emerge.‚Äù
As such, it‚Äôs important for companies to make sure their fraud solution partners can adapt to these changes and work to develop new solutions as needed. Ideally, these partners should leverage technologies such as AI and machine learning to stay ahead of the game and mitigate fraud before it happens.
‚ÄúWhat [businesses] need to do is to continually evolve and adapt to understand what‚Äôs happening and tackle the problems that arise,‚Äù he concludes.

Org Chart maps out the people at the top of Asia‚Äôs most prominent tech companies. Who are the key decision-makers? How are the teams organized? What does it tell us about the company‚Äôs priorities? We continue this series with ecommerce major Lazada.
When Lazada launched in Southeast Asia in 2012, it was well placed to seize the region‚Äôs ecommerce market. A decade later, the company nearly went public until parent firm Alibaba shelved talks earlier this year.
Backed by German venture builder Rocket Internet and big-name investors like JPMorgan Chase, co-founders Maximillian Bittner, Mads Furholt, Stefan Bruun, and Rafael Stauch created Lazada. What started out as an Amazon clone would eventually come to define the early days of Southeast Asia‚Äôs ecommerce scene.
See also: A closer look at the Lazada mafia
Since then, Lazada has been through many changes, including a revolving door of CEOs.
In November 2018, Bittner was replaced as CEO by former Ant Financial fintech director Lucy Peng. But just nine months after assuming the role, Peng herself stepped down and handed over the reins to Lazada veteran Pierre Poignant in August 2019.
Poignant left Lazada in June 2020, and Chun Li became the ecommerce major‚Äôs third CEO in three years. He was CTO at Alibaba‚Äôs B2B business unit between 2014 to 2017. Li is also Lazada Indonesia‚Äôs CEO, indicating the significance of the country‚Äôs ecommerce market.
Li isn‚Äôt the only top executive to have ties to Alibaba. Lazada CFO Frank Luo, for example, was a finance director at the Chinese tech titan between 2017 to 2018. Andy Huang, Lazada‚Äôs chief logistics officer, had a three-year stint as vice president of supply chain and logistics at Cainiao, Alibaba‚Äôs logistics arm.
Other Alibaba alumni at Lazada include Lilian Jiang, Howard Wang, and Raymond Yang, who serve as chief people officer, CTO, and COO respectively.
Here are a few more observations:

Each country has its own CEO except Thailand and Vietnam, which are both helmed by James Dong.
Jessica Liu was president of Lazada Group and CEO of Lazada Thailand until her departure in May 2021. It‚Äôs unclear whether her role as group president has been filled since then.
Magnus Ekbom, chief strategy officer and acting CEO at Lazada Malaysia, and Gerald Glauerdt, chief logistics officer at Redmart/Lazada Singapore, are the only executives left from the original Rocket Internet founding team.
Lazada Wallet is operated by Alibaba‚Äôs Alipay division. Some executives that oversee Lazada Wallet are also Alipay employees.
Richard Ruddy and Emily Eades joined Redmart after the Singapore-based online grocery store was acquired by Lazada in 2016.

Tech in Asia invited Lazada to participate in this story, but the company declined. We have verified the chart with former and current Lazada employees as well as via publicly available information.

Inceptio offers autonomous driving tech for trucks and operates a nationwide transportation-as-a-service freight network. It works with players in the automotive industry by preloading its offerings and systems into mass-produced autonomous trucks.
At the end of 2021, Inceptio said it realized front-loading mass production of Level 3 (L3) autonomous driving trucks, in cooperation with its industry partners. Level 3 means that a vehicle can fully take over all driving tasks, but drivers still need to pay constant attention to the road and keep their hands near their steering wheels.
According to the company, its L3 trucks have already been cost validated and are now scaling up.
Julian Ma, the founder and CEO of Inceptio, said that the startup will keep its focus on full-stack independent development and center its tech around mass production units.

We break down the big and messy topics of Asia‚Äôs tech and startup community. Get the newsletter in your inbox everyday with a Premium subscription.
Hello reader,
As startups go through their different stages of growth, founders are invariably posed with the question of how to not only retain but also develop their most prized talents.
Financial incentives such as employee stock ownership plans, increased salaries, and better perks are one way of achieving this. However, it may not be the most sustainable strategy, given most startups are strapped for cash.
Others may instead focus on strategies that don‚Äôt burn their pockets. One example is a program focused on putting ‚Äúworkers in the center‚Äù by prioritizing personalized learning, leadership experiences, and growth, which is being touted as a way to keep hold of talented employees.
It appears that Sea Group has led the way on this front.
For our premium story pick today, Tech in Asia spoke with several Sea Group alumni who waxed lyrical about its workplace culture. For instance, the word ‚Äúhungry‚Äù comes up more than once to describe Sea employees‚Äô desire to solve problems.
Entrepreneur Keren Wang spoke glowingly about her holistic experience at Shopee, Sea‚Äôs ecommerce platform, while ShakeDeal co-founder Akash Hegde shared that he had a front-row seat to how a company could be scaled up, having worked at Shopee in its early days.
Today we look at:

Building on Sea‚Äôs success

Sea‚Äôs steady growth provides a handy reminder to its alumni network that they‚Äôre well-equipped to scale and build successful businesses. Perhaps that partly explains why it‚Äôs been a busy time for some of Sea Group‚Äôs alumni, who have launched new startups despite the Covid-19 pandemic.
Not surprisingly, most of the startups founded by Sea‚Äôs alumni are in the ecommerce space. But many who were with Garena, Sea‚Äôs digital entertainment unit, have launched gaming-related ventures.


Heavy hitters: While most startups coming out of Sea‚Äôs alumni network have received funding in the seed stage, some have made formidable strides. Jumei, a China-based online cosmetics company, made a US$430 million stock market debut in 2014. Bitkub, a Thailand-based cryptocurrency exchange, was acquired for US$536 million in November 2021.


More are coming: What most alumni agree on is that there are going to be a lot more startups founded by the Sea mafia in the next couple of years. For Luke Ong, an ex-Shopee team member who is part of the founding team at Una Brands, he believes that more startups will emerge from the network in two to three years.


Serial entrepreneur: Some Sea alumni have established multiple startups in Indonesia. After setting up Modal Rakyat, a working-capital enabler for startups and SMEs, in 2018, Wafa Taftazani launched two startups in 2021 ‚Äì VCGamers and UpBanx. It‚Äôs a playbook that‚Äôs worked well for those who were former employees of Shopee.

Locofast, a textile-focused supply chain platform, has raised US$15 million in a series A round co-led by Stellaris Venture Partners and Chiratae Ventures. The India-based startup also raised an undisclosed sum in debt from Stride Ventures and BlackSoil Capital. Its platform aims to make it easier for vendors to connect with suppliers across India.
To date, Locofast has onboarded more than 500 suppliers and manages the supply chain of more than 700 brands, including fast-fashion retailers Zara and H&amp;M.


Spinning a yarn: Deepak Wadhwa, co-founder of Locofast, told Tech in Asia that in terms of gross merchandise value, the company had grown at an average of 20% month-on-month since its launch in 2019. He added that the company recorded a 50x revenue growth in the last 18 months.


No knots here: One of Locofast‚Äôs key focus areas will be international expansion. While it already has customers from Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, it will set up an office in the US soon. The firm expects the expansion to contribute at least 20% to 25% of the total business in the next 12 months. It‚Äôs also mulling over entering Europe, especially its large markets.


Weaving growth: Aside from expanding its domestic and overseas presence, Locofast will use the fresh capital to launch new product categories. The company also plans to increase its current headcount of 50 to as much as 500 over the next 12 months, and it aims to grow the number of suppliers on its platform to 2,500 in the same period.

735328,2022-03-02T08:49:58,Grab shares to rise with recovery in mobility expected in Q4: report,"Southeast Asian super app Grab‚Äòs shares are expected to rise after it announces its fourth quarter results tomorrow as the firm sees a gradual recovery for its mobility business, according to a SmartKarma report.
‚ÄúAs most of the countries in Southeast Asia open up economies with Omicron-related fears fading, we expect a gradual recovery in its mobility business, which should help re-rate Grab‚Äôs shares upwards,‚Äù wrote LightStream Research analyst Shifara Samsudeen. The report added that the company‚Äôs mobility business has not yet recovered to pre-pandemic levels.
Grab is currently trading at US$5.80 per share, more than 50% below its IPO price of US$13.06 per share.
Last November, Grab posted a revenue of US$157 million for the third quarter of 2021, down 9% from the same period in the year prior. The company attributed much of the drop in its topline to reduced mobility in Vietnam, which had enforced severe lockdowns amid the Covid-19 pandemic.
The super app also said that its reported revenue for Q3 2021 was net of consumer, merchant, and driver-partner incentives.

The firm has so far trimmed US$127 billion in market value from its peak last November .
The decline in market value comes after Sea cut its year-on-year booking guidance for its digital entertainment unit Garena for the first time, dragging down the company‚Äôs shares in US trading by 13%. Sea‚Äôs current market value stands at US$70.6 billion.

For the full year of 2022, Sea expects bookings for Garena to come in at between US$2.9 billion and US$3.1 billion. In comparison, the estimate for 2021¬†was between US$4.3 billion and US$4.5 billion.
Quarterly paying users of its gaming business also dropped sharply to 77.2 million from 93.2 million in Q3 2021.
The company cited ‚Äúunanticipated government actions‚Äù in India as one of the reasons for the decline in its digital entertainment unit forecast. Sea‚Äôs flagship game Free Fire is currently unavailable in the Google Play and iOS app stores in India after the government banned it along with other apps.

If you‚Äôre not a subscriber, get access by registering here.
Hello there,
I don‚Äôt remember the last time I withdrew cash from an ATM ‚Äì all my transactions are done via digital wallets these days.
Since I live in one of India‚Äôs metropolitan cities, which are more mature markets for fintech, maybe it‚Äôs a privilege that I get to say this. That said, a closer look will show that the growth of digital transactions is now driven by Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities in the country.
India‚Äôs fintech sector has become a crowded market, regularly tapping into billions of dollars from investors. But fintech adoption seems like a global phenomenon. Not too far away from India, Vietnam also has a burgeoning fintech space, which attracted over US$500 million in funding in 2021 alone.
One player is Vietnam‚Äôs latest unicorn, MoMo. With a user base of 31 million, the fintech firm can pin its early success down to its mobile-only approach.
But experts say that fintech companies cannot grow on digital wallet services alone, as the margins are too thin. That may be why MoMo is now trudging on a path toward its super-app dreams.
In this week‚Äôs Big Story, my colleague Huong dives into MoMo‚Äôs super-app ambitions. Can the company reinvent itself to survive intense competition in Vietnam?

THE HOT TAKEGreen financing takes off in Indonesia

Photo credit: Akulaku

Here‚Äôs what happened:

Indonesian fintech firm Akulaku is considering receiving US$100 million in green financing
The source of the funds is a Singapore-based entity
Funding may be channeled to consumers wanting to purchase electric vehicles

Here‚Äôs our take:
Akulaku, an Indonesian digital banking and finance unicorn, is considering receiving US$100 million in green bonds from a Singapore-based entity. This comes on the back of its recent US$100 million series E fundraising that saw its valuation rise to US$2 billion.
Indonesia is no stranger to green financing: The country‚Äôs government has issued at least four green bonds since 2018, and the Asian Development Bank approved a US$150 million loan to support green infrastructure projects in the archipelago just last month.
However, the private sector has been less active, especially compared to peers such as Thailand.
If it pushes through, the deal with Akulaku will mark a turning point. As a private sector company that lends to consumers, Akulaku can link green financing directly to consumers‚Äô wallets and their purchasing decisions.
The impact this will have is uncertain. The Indonesian consumer is generally less aware of climate change than those in other countries. A survey conducted by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication found that only 32% of Indonesian respondents claimed to know either a lot or a moderate amount about climate change, the second-lowest of the 31 countries surveyed.
Additionally, Indonesia is also among the top 10 countries that believe more information is needed about climate change to form a firm opinion.

Companies like Akulaku that have a direct relationship with the consumer and can offer them financing, specifically for purchasing sustainable products and services, are well-positioned to educate consumers.
Financing electric vehicle (EV) purchases is a good place to start. Indonesia is one of the markets with the highest potential for EV adoption in the world, according to McKinsey &amp; Company.
But EVs are just the tip of the iceberg. Products ranging from mattresses to iPhone cases can have an eco-friendly angle.
Of course, one of the thorny questions is who gets to decide what is green and what isn‚Äôt ‚Äì will that responsibility lie with companies like Akulaku as well? Amid a growing chorus warning against ‚Äúgreenwashing‚Äù and as green financing increases its market share, these questions will become more important.
US$100 million represents under 5% of the US$2.2 billion in credit that Akulaku disbursed in 2021. Yet, it would be a small step in the right direction to shape local attitudes and behavior toward climate change.

Nsure.ai provides firms with software that can help protect them against fraud. It provides its tech to companies that operate in the crypto payments, NFT, digital wallet, banking, airline ticket, software, and gaming spaces, among others.

734774,2022-03-02T02:00:49,When good customers behave badly: The unknown side of online retail fraud,"Ecommerce was one of the earliest successes in Southeast Asia‚Äôs tech and startup scene, and if last year‚Äôs 11.11 sales results are any indication, it‚Äôs a train that‚Äôs not stopping any time soon. During the sales event, Shopee set new records for items sold and shopper visits, while Lazada saw new users in Thailand rise by 120% compared to 2020.
One major driver of these mind-boggling numbers is the promotions and discounts that come out in full force during these major sales events. In the lead-up to the actual sale days, shoppers are encouraged to collect all manner of vouchers, and they also get access to benefits such as free returns or gifts with their purchases, among others.
Unfortunately, despite these offers, some customers still look for loopholes to get extra benefits. This is also known as policy abuse, which is when customers exploit the benefits available to them.
One example of this is promotions abuse. According to Monica Acree, general manager and vice president of sales at fraud prevention company Forter, retailers offer many incentives ‚Äì such as giving customers 10% off their first purchase ‚Äì to drive customer retention. ‚ÄúHowever, some shoppers will often open multiple accounts to take advantage of this discount, and as a result, the retailer ends up incentivizing existing customers unintentionally, which drives up the cost of acquisition,‚Äù she says.
Differentiating between fraud and abuse
These cases of abuse don‚Äôt strike casual observers as particularly damaging to online retailers. It‚Äôs just smart shopping, right? While many think the real problem comes from card and identity fraudsters, the numbers tell a different story. Global studies show that fraud losses add up to around US$22 billion a year, while policy abuse losses are much greater, estimated at around US$65 billion annually, Acree says.

These losses pile up from various sources like logistics fees, restocking costs, losses from damaged goods, and costs from inventory that can‚Äôt be resold. The overall operational burden of managing these processes also has a significant impact on the retailer‚Äôs bottom line.
But let‚Äôs take a step back and explain the difference between fraudsters and abusers. ‚ÄúFraudsters are generally bad actors participating in illegal behavior, such as stealing identities or payment instruments, and utilizing that for financial gain,‚Äù Acree explains. On the other hand, abusers, she says, are actual customers who take advantage of a retailer‚Äôs policies or promotions. ‚ÄúIn layman‚Äôs terms, this is when good customers are doing bad things.‚Äù
Besides promotions abuse, there are other ways that customers try to game the system. One example is an abuse of the returns system. In these cases, a culprit could buy an item such as skincare or perfume, empty the container, fill it with water or a cheaper product, then return it. In some instances, abusers will mark that they haven‚Äôt received an item and file for a refund even though the product was successfully delivered.
A fine line
The ways that fraud and abuse are combated also differ. Countermeasures are black and white when dealing with fraudsters ‚Äì they are breaking the law and should be identified and reported to the authorities. When it comes to policy abusers, however, it‚Äôs much trickier, as risk tolerances and policies differ from retailer to retailer.
‚ÄúIt looks different for every business, so it‚Äôs really hard to accurately measure in real time the losses or the cost to the organization,‚Äù Acree points out. ‚ÄúAdditionally, because policy abusers are technically legitimate customers just doing bad things, you might not want to have a binary response to these abusers. You might want to have a more nuanced approach.‚Äù
With returns abuse, for example, imposing a blanket ‚Äúno free returns‚Äù policy on the whole customer base might solve the issue, but it also punishes good customers who have legitimate reasons for returning an item. It‚Äôs important to understand that abusers make up only a small segment of users, so retailers shouldn‚Äôt treat all customers the same.
‚ÄúYou have to really look behind the transaction and at the identity of that user to understand the potential risk associated with each customer and offer tailored policies,‚Äù Acree says. ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs a challenge because a lot of retailers don‚Äôt have those tools in place to do that.‚Äù
A network of protection
Forter, the fraud prevention company Acree works for, helps online retailers with this very issue with its Trusted Policies solutions, which utilize machine learning and AI to pinpoint the identity behind online interactions. This enables retailers to make informed decisions and even tailor policies for each individual. For example, an identity known to be a repeat abuser of returns policies can have their next purchase marked as a ‚Äúfinal sale.‚Äù
‚ÄúOur solution is not a rules-based solution,‚Äù Acree explains, adding that the company has visibility on over a billion individual identities globally. ‚ÄúOften with fraud or abuse prevention, retailers will set rules which cast wide nets. Anybody that passes the rule gets approved; anybody that does not pass gets declined. And that causes a lot of what we call false positives, where good customers are being declined.‚Äù

Additionally, the company works with a large network of retailers, processing over US$250 billion worth of transactions on an annual basis. When a case of abuse occurs on one platform, Forter not only helps solve the issue for that retailer, it also proactively puts in place measures to prevent that identity from abusing the policies of its other clients.
‚ÄúWe have a large network of identities that we can leverage from one retailer to another,‚Äù Acree says. ‚ÄúThat network impact is one critical thing that we can offer retailers beyond their own abuse prevention policies.‚Äù
More shopping days, more problems
As ecommerce continues to grow, so too will customer expectations. Retailers have to keep pace with better promotions and flexible policies. The continued success and proliferation of major sale days means more opportunities over the course of each year for policy abuse to occur.
The markedly increased traffic that these campaigns bring in also means that hiring people to manually review transactions is not a scalable option and that automation is a necessity.
To stay competitive, Acree says, it‚Äôs important for retailers to be able to offer these flexible policies.
‚ÄúThey just have to identify that small segment taking advantage ‚Äì and that‚Äôs going to always try to take advantage ‚Äì so they can be addressed while preserving the most positive experience for all their other customers,‚Äù she concludes.

734870,2022-03-02T01:55:10,Analyzing MoMo‚Äôs super-app ambitions,"At MoMo‚Äôs headquarters in Ho Chi Minh City, there‚Äôs a stylish joint called Ironman Bar, where staff can chill, play pingpong, or enjoy the city view.

In January, the fintech firm‚Äôs 7,000-square-meter office officially opened in the upscale District 7. The new location¬†signifies its status as Vietnam‚Äôs latest tech unicorn after a recent US$200 million series E round¬†led by Japan‚Äôs Mizuho Bank.
Now valued at US$2.2 billion, MoMo ‚Äì which is short for ‚Äúmobile money‚Äù ‚Äì was founded in 2010 by a group of Vietnamese entrepreneurs harboring a ‚Äúcashless vision‚Äù for Vietnam where everyone can pay using their mobile phones.
Originally, it was conceived as a SIM-based mobile wallet for telecom operator Vinaphone, allowing users to transfer money or top-up their mobile credit.¬†The company later released app versions for Android and iOS in 2014.
MoMo‚Äôs mobile-only approach has been key to its early success, having reportedly cornered more than half of the market share in Vietnam‚Äôs digital wallet space.
With a user base of 31 million, MoMo now aspires to build a full-fledged financial ecosystem that enables users, small businesses, and financial services providers to tap onto the platform.
The question is: Can its super-app ambition survive intense competition and a landscape where traditional banks still dominate?
Leading¬†a crowded space
Alongside its new headquarters, MoMo also introduced a star-studded AI Committee to implement what it calls an AI-first strategy. The team includes veteran engineers who previously worked at Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, VNG, and FPT Group.

The move follows MoMo‚Äôs acquihire of local AI startup Pique in June 2021. Pique creates AI-enabled recommendations for businesses to get customers engaged and buy more.
The deal is expected to help MoMo better use and monetize its trove of data. The company says it allocates 20% to 25% of its technology budget for AI and wants to up its total number of engineers to 1,000 within this year.
The fintech unicorn certainly has the resources to attract talent now. According to Tech in Asia data, MoMo has raised about US$433 million in disclosed funding, pulling far ahead of most domestic competitors.


Notably, in MoMo‚Äôs latest fundraise, Mizuho Bank bought a 7.5% stake in the fintech firm, which is reportedly worth US$175 million. Mizuho also has a 15% stake in Vietcombank, a major commercial bank in Vietnam that clocked in US$1.1 billion in profit in 2021.
It‚Äôs no surprise that investors are still willing to bet on Vietnam‚Äôs overcrowded fintech space. In 2021 alone, the sector attracted more than US$580 million in funding.

The country‚Äôs internet economy is projected to grow 29% annually until 2025, according to the Google-led 2021 SEA e-Conomy report. Much of the optimism has to do with the potential runway to offer financial services for Vietnam‚Äôs unbanked and underbanked population.

For years, MoMo had to make up for its independence by aggressively expanding its network of merchants and users through discounts and marketing, sealing partnerships with companies like Lazada, Tiki, Apple, and Google to expand its user base quickly.
But there might be limits to this approach. Rivals like ZaloPay can leverage users from Zalo, while AirPay (now rebranded as ShopeePay) can tap into Shopee‚Äôs dominance in Vietnam.
In 2021, ZaloPay burned through approximately US$52 million. Its potential to create synergy with Zalo messenger, which has about 52 million users in the country, has been enormously untapped.

However, major players such as Shopee only allow the use of ShopeePay for transactions on its marketplace. This could potentially limit MoMo‚Äôs growth, notes Huy Pham, a finance lecturer at RMIT University in Vietnam and the founder of RMIT Fintech-Crypto Hub.
Last year, Shopee rebranded its food delivery and payment services in Vietnam to ShopeeFood and ShopeePay, respectively, to signal increased synergies with the main ecommerce platform.
‚ÄúThis is why MoMo is trying to make a transition from being a payment intermediary to co-developing more tailored products with its partners such as banks or insurance providers,‚Äù says Pham.
Can‚Äôt live by wallets alone
The industry consensus is that fintech companies can‚Äôt grow or even survive by offering e-wallet services alone as the margins are too thin.
‚ÄúWith respect to people‚Äôs finances, there are five main activities: earn, spend, borrow, save, and invest. MoMo should participate in all that,‚Äù says Nam Le, a principal at Vietnam-focused investor Touchstone Partners.

Photo credit: MoMo

In 2019, Pham Thanh Duc, CEO of MoMo parent company M_Service, told TechCrunch that ‚Äúthe playbook is very much based upon the success of Alibaba‚Äôs Alipay and Tencent‚Äôs WeChat Pay services in China, which went from payments to loans and investing and more.‚Äù
MoMo is moving toward that direction. In August 2021, it launched a buy now, pay later service with TPBank that enables e-wallet users to borrow up to 10 million dong (US$438) based on their credit scores calculated by MoMo. Users of this BNPL service don‚Äôt need to show proof of their income. The feature particularly targets customers who have no access to credit cards.
In January, the fintech firm¬†bought a stake in Nhanh.vn, a startup that offers sales management software to small businesses in Vietnam. This second acquisition is part of MoMo‚Äôs push to offer multiple services to SMEs, which make up 98% of all businesses in the country.
‚ÄúBeing tight with SMEs is a good thing,‚Äù says Angus Mackintosh, founder of CrossASEAN Research. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a high-growth segment for companies in Indonesia such as Bukalapak. You can enable these small businesses to use digital payments, source goods, and provide small or working capital loans.‚Äù
MoMo has declined to reveal more details to Tech in Asia when asked about its strategies to compete outside the e-wallet space. However, the company noted in its series E announcement that its priorities include providing services to SMEs and expanding to lower-tier cities and rural areas.

In an interview with Bloomberg, MoMo co-founder and chairman Nguyen Manh Tuong said 40% of the company‚Äôs users live outside big cities. He believes that MoMo‚Äôs payment business could be ‚Äúattractive‚Äù to farming communities, whose members often have to travel long distances to pay bills.
This is a matter of survival for the fintech firm ‚Äúsince the e-wallet usage is a lot lower in those areas,‚Äù Pham of RMIT University observes. ‚ÄúMoMo might need to experiment with new products that target residents in rural areas where agriculture dominates.‚Äù
Immense challenges
But this next phase of growth for MoMo can be long and winding.
For one, existing regulations haven‚Äôt exactly favored e-wallet providers. All digital wallets in Vietnam must be linked to bank accounts, which is a handicap given banking penetration in rural areas is low.

The question becomes: What can the e-wallet offer that the bank can‚Äôt?
‚ÄúMost people in big cities have access to the traditional banking system, easily obtain a credit card that offers a similar BNPL option, and the credit limit is a lot higher than the 10 million dong BNPL limit of MoMo,‚Äù says RMIT University‚Äôs Pham.
Another restriction is that e-wallet providers are not allowed to directly offer loans to consumers unless they have a lending license. This means that MoMo has to partner with banks to offer other value-added financial services, or it can just act as a consumer acquisition channel for the bank. Even in such cases, the ultimate relationship with the consumer still lies with the bank.¬†
However, Le of Touchstone Partners is optimistic about those potential partnerships. ‚ÄúBy leveraging traditional banks‚Äô balance sheets, both can benefit from the digital adoption of e-wallets,‚Äù he explains, referring to the banks‚Äô capacity to lend. ‚ÄúMoMo can position itself as a technology partner rather than a direct competitor.‚Äù
But Vietnamese commercial banks don‚Äôt sit on the sidelines waiting to be disrupted. As the fintech fever grips Vietnam, these banks have also been aggressively investing in digital transformation. In fact, several of the top 10 finance apps in the country (in terms of year-on-year growth in downloads and monthly active users) belong to traditional banks.

Another Goliath in the financial services race is Viettel, Vietnam‚Äôs largest telecom operator, which generated US$1.7 billion profit in 2021. Last January, the group rebranded itself to transform from a traditional telco to a digital services provider, a rare move for a state-owned entity. Tech in Asia previously analyzed why Viettel could have an edge with mobile money.

Not just in digital payments, foreign fintech companies such as Atome and Kredivo (BNPL) as well as Validus and Funding Societies (SME financing) are also willing to bet big on Vietnam.
In particular, Funding Societies, which recently raised US$294 million, has sealed a partnership with VNG. The latter contributed US$22.5 million in the round that also involved SoftBank. VNG owns ZaloPay, one of MoMo‚Äôs closest competitors in the e-wallet space.
A spokesperson from Funding Societies told Tech in Asia that the company and VNG Group could create a ‚Äúseamless customer experience‚Äù across lending, payments, spend management, and other services for SMEs.
Future prospects
A ‚Äúlogical progression‚Äù for MoMo is to become a digital bank, says Mackintosh. That, of course, is only possible if the Vietnamese government grants such a license.
Unlike its Southeast Asian neighbors, Vietnam‚Äôs existing digital banks have to be tied to their traditional counterparts. As an example, Timo, which in January raised US$20 million in a round led by Square Peg, operates as a digital-only bank under a partnership with Viet Capital Bank.
For MoMo, there‚Äôs also a prospect of an IPO down the road, which CEO Pham Thanh Duc previously¬†told Reuters that it could take place in 2025.
See also:¬†Why Vietnam is missing out on SEA‚Äôs IPO party
In an analysis for Smartkarma, Alec Tseung of Hong Kong‚Äôs KT Capital Group wrote that ‚Äúfrom an investor‚Äôs perspective, the future success of MoMo largely depends on whether it manages to diversify from e-wallets and payments into a complete financial ecosystem‚Äù within the next three to five years.
The analyst pointed out that Ant Financial‚Äôs non-digital payments businesses (such as lending, insurance, and investments) contributed about half of its total revenue but only about 7% of its total transaction value in 2019. The company hasn‚Äôt disclosed more recent numbers after its IPO fell through in 2020.
Tseung estimates that MoMo‚Äôs take rate ‚Äì which refers to the average fee it earns from facilitating transactions and payments ‚Äì is around 3%. ‚ÄúTake rate will be the most sensitive factor in determining the valuation of the company and the return for investors,‚Äù Tseung said in an interview with Tech in Asia.

Despite the challenges, MoMo arguably still has one of the most recognizable brands in the domestic consumer tech market. One of its hugely popular features is L·∫Øc x√¨, which is released annually during the T·∫øt (Lunar New Year) campaign. The game, which attracts millions of players, lets you earn prizes from the God of Fortune.
But the issue is how to get people to stick around afterwards. ‚ÄúMoMo has served as a fintech leader and pushed innovation over the last decade,‚Äù says Pham of RMIT University, who adds it‚Äôs now time for the company to ‚Äúreinvent once again.‚Äù",Thu Huong Le,Terence Lee and Lorenzo Kyle Subido,0,"['Analysis', 'Fintech', 'Premium Content']",True,True,9

Nam describes SoBanHang as the lite version of Shopify that enables small businesses to create online stores. ‚ÄúThe goal is for the merchants to reach more customers and increase sales, while bookkeeping is just one of our features,‚Äù Nam tells Tech in Asia.
Launched last year by Nam and his brother Bui Hai Long ‚Äì both former executives at Lazada Vietnam ‚Äì SoBanHang has raised US$4 million from investors, which includes a US$1.5 million round in August 2021 and another US$2.5 million round closed in February. Its backers include FEBE Ventures, Class 5, Trihill Capital, and AlleyCorp, among others.

SoBanHang is riding on a wave of startups in Vietnam looking to digitize small businesses and retailers. However, it wants to focus on serving the ‚Äúnano and micro segment,‚Äù which refers to household businesses or solo sellers that cannot afford to invest in point-of-sale software and other online infrastructure.
See also:¬†Can Indonesia‚Äôs Shopify-like startups usurp ecommerce giants?
Nam estimates that Vietnam has about 16 million small businesses, of which the ‚Äúnano and micro‚Äù retailers¬†are particularly underserved.
The pandemic has further aggravated retailers‚Äô struggles, with most having troubles going online. ‚ÄúEven those who can sell via social, everything is done manually,‚Äù says Nam. ‚ÄúSelling on social media is like putting classified ads. You don‚Äôt really have a proper catalog or other tools to manage the orders.‚Äù
The SoBanHang app enables retailers to build an online store, create promotions, manage inventory, and track in-store sales and information about loyal customers. According to the company, its app serves about 170,000 merchants. The app is currently free, but the startup plans to roll out a subscription model soon.
Unlike other B2B ecommerce startups like Telio or VinShop that have to invest heavily in logistics and warehouses, SoBanHang remains mobile-only and asset-light, according to Nam. However, it can support its merchants with inventory or logistics through partnerships with third-party providers, he adds.

For the full year of 2022, Sea expects bookings for Garena to be between US$2.9 billion and US$3.1 billion. In comparison, the estimate for 2021 was between US$4.3 billion and US$4.5 billion.
‚ÄúWith many economies reopening further in the fourth quarter and into this year, we have observed some moderation in online activities and fluctuations in user engagement. Moreover, due to unanticipated government actions, Free Fire is currently unavailable in the Google Play and iOS app stores in India,‚Äù stated the company.

However, Sea increased the revenue guidance for its two other core businesses: Shopee (ecommerce) and SeaMoney (digital financial services).
For Shopee, Sea has raised its annual revenue guidance to a range of US$8.9 billion to US$9.1 billion for fiscal year 2022. The midpoint of the guidance represents an increase of 75.7% from 2021, stated the company.

By 2025, the company expects that cash collectively generated by Shopee and SeaMoney will enable both businesses to fund their own long-term growth.
Shopee reported an 89.4% year-on-year growth in revenue, which stood at US$1.6 billion for Q4 2021.
The company noted that SeaMoney has also become a strong growth engine. The segment‚Äôs GAAP revenue was US$197.5 million, up over 7x from the same period a year ago.
Sea expects GAAP revenue for the unit to be between US$1.1 billion and US$1.3 billion for 2022, the midpoint of the guidance representing an increase of 155.4% from 2021.
Overall, Sea said that its GAAP revenue doubled in Q4 2021 to US$3.2 billion. For the full year 2021, its revenue surged by 127.5% to US$10 billion from US$4.4 billion in 2020.

However, its net loss grew by 5% to US$573.5 million in the same period.

The company logged US$224.3 million in net revenue for the fourth quarter of 2021, growing 68% from the US$133.5 million it recorded in the same period in 2020.

This segment offset the cost of revenue from operations on its own, which came in at around US$398.6 million in 2021. That number grew from US$206.6 million in the year prior, mainly driven by an increase in value-added tax and other tax-related costs, the company said.
Meanwhile, Full Truck Alliance increased its non-GAAP adjusted net income by 60% from US$44.1 million in 2020 to US$70.7 million last year.

We break down the big and messy topics of Asia‚Äôs tech and startup community. Get the newsletter in your inbox everyday with a Premium subscription.
Hello reader,
I‚Äôm ashamed to admit that I rarely watch even the greatest Hollywood movies unless I think it might help with work.
But I had to give Rocky a shot because its underdog tale of determination and grit inspires people from all walks of life, even today.
The story of the Philippines‚Äô crypto firms, which had been overlooked by the country‚Äôs startup ecosystem, is not that different.
Just as Rocky rose as an unlikely contender to the mighty Apollo Creed through unconventional training, crypto startups in the Philippines do not fit into conservative investment mandates but have secured sizable funding rounds.
These startups have done so by adopting tech amid the Covid-19 pandemic. They have also used their knowledge of the crypto space to get ahead of the curve.
I hope this story gives you a chance to take a look at some of the country‚Äôs startups that have flown under the radar, because every champion was once a contender who refused to give up.
Today we look at:

The potential rise of a new crypto hub in Asia

Raining crypto in the Philippines

The Philippines could be Asia‚Äôs next crypto hub as local startups in the space are securing money at rising valuations.
Crypto players are also driving financial inclusion for the country‚Äôs unbanked as they leapfrog the banking system by putting crypto wallets into people‚Äôs hands.
One factor that has contributed to the growth of these startups is the Covid-19 pandemic, which has created the ideal setting for tech like crypto to come to the fore. Amid falling incomes and  growing unemployment due to the global health crisis, play-to-earn (P2E) games such as Axie Infinity have helped push crypto adoption in the Philippines.


Laying low: Some of the country‚Äôs crypto players have been flying under the radar but have gotten sizable funding. These include blockchain P2E startup Yield Guild Games and NFT generator BreederDAO, the first two Philippine companies to receive backing from Silicon Valley VC Andreessen Horowitz.


Crypto frenzy: Crypto ownership is on the rise. About 4% of the population ‚Äì or over 4.3 million people ‚Äì have crypto assets, according to research by TripleA. In 2021, the Philippines made it to the top 20 countries in Chainalysis‚Äô Global Crypto Adoption Index, which ranks countries according to total cryptocurrency activity.


Turn of the tide: Fundraising was a lot harder in 2018 than it was in 2020, and a lot of it had to do with how much money there was to go around, said Nichel Gaba, founder and CEO of Philippine Digital Asset Exchange (PDAX). He added that in 2021, PDAX started seeing more of the global mega funds look at crypto firms.

688675,2022-03-01T03:00:49,Unearthing Sea Group‚Äôs alumni network,"This is the latest version of the article that was published on June 7, 2021. We‚Äôve added more alumni members to the visual and table.

¬†
In a world where unicorns hog headlines, Asia Partners‚Äô Nick Nash says the growth equity firm has its eyes on the ‚Äúbaby rhinoceri running around‚Äù instead. He‚Äôs referring to the startups that are underrated, humble, thick-skinned, and authentic.
Earlier this March, Asia Partners announced the close of its inaugural fund for startups in Southeast Asia at a significant US$384 million.
Nash, the firm‚Äôs co-founder and managing partner, knows a thing or two about the rhinos Asia Partners is betting on firsthand. After all, he is the former group president of Sea Group, what used to be an underrated company which now has a market cap of about US$76.7 billion.
Garena, Sea‚Äôs gaming arm, has continued to be on a steady growth path. The company‚Äôs ecommerce vertical, Shopee, has dominated Southeast Asia within just a few years, keeping competitors like Lazada on their toes.
So we wanted to know just how much impact can a company‚Äôs growth ‚Äì and the way it is growing ‚Äì affect what its alumni do?
As Tech in Asia found out, that answer is woven into the innate workings of the startups founded by these alumni. And much like in the case of Grab and Gojek‚Äôs networks, as we have chronicled previously, the companies founded by former Sea employees are spread out across various verticals.


This is perhaps because those who worked at the company were able to garner a diverse set of experiences before striking out on their own.
In a lot of ecommerce companies, team members usually manage a very specific part of the business, says Weizeng (Wilson) Zhang, founder of Thailand-based electronics trading platform Remobie. ‚ÄúBut [at Sea] I got to learn how to be a jack-of-all-trades since Shopee gave me a lot of hands-on experiences in different fields ‚Äì from marketing to operations.‚Äù
Entrepreneur Keren Wang‚Äôs experience at Shopee was similar. Wang spent close to five years working in and with different departments in the firm like marketing and cross-border operations before founding an ecommerce enabler called AladdinCommerce in Singapore late last year.
The company helps digitize traditional retailers and onboards them onto platforms such as Shopee and Lazada. Most of AladdinCommerce‚Äôs clients are in Singapore and China.
‚ÄúThese are traditional brick-and-mortar businesses, and we help them with everything from taking professional photos to setting up video-streaming and shop optimization,‚Äù says Wang.
Her experience on Shopee‚Äôs team has given her insight into what is usually expected of these small businesses when they go online. ‚ÄúYou need to know the rules of the game to play the game,‚Äù she says.
As you scan our network map, it may seem like the web of Sea founders may not be as extensive as Grab, Gojek, or Lazada‚Äôs. But many believe that Sea‚Äôs promising growth trajectory has inspired its staff to stay on with the company.
‚ÄúRisk-takers are always in a minority. People who left the company during my tenure there did mainly to join other companies,‚Äù says Zhang.
See also: The growing Lazada mafia
In some cases, like-minded colleagues have also left Sea to start new ventures. Perhaps the most prominent example is that of Asia Partners‚Äô Nash and Vorapol (Brook) Supanusonti, a former senior executive at Sea who was also among the co-founders of Asia Partners. At Remobie, meanwhile, three of the company‚Äôs four founders, Zhang, Krittin Tantisawetrat, and Karintorn Tungtawee, are Shopee alumni.
There‚Äôre good reasons to stay on at Sea, many feel. Shopee, for instance, ‚Äúinvests a lot in its people,‚Äù says Tran Le Thanh Nhu, co-founder of Schola, an edtech venture based out of Singapore and Vietnam.
Fresh out of college, Tran kick-started her career by joining Garena in 2013 as a product marketing manager. Her tasks varied from launching the popular game ThunderStrike in Vietnam to pushing out an entertainment platform called Talk Talk.
Schola, which she co-founded in 2018, teaches English-speaking skills to children between the ages of four and 15 using gamified STEM subjects in a curriculum designed by Cambridge-certified educators. Spread across Vietnam, Thailand, South Korea, and Japan, the company now has over 10,000 students.
Others echo Tran‚Äôs views on the quality of not just Sea‚Äôs hires, but also its culture.
‚ÄúI can‚Äôt underscore enough that I genuinely believe I was working with some of the smartest minds in Southeast Asia while I was at Shopee,‚Äù says Akash Hegde, co-founder of India-based business-to-business ecommerce platform ShakeDeal.
The company takes care of its employees and offers perks comparable to other tech companies around the world, says Hegde, a Forbes 30 Under 30 inductee who was part of Shopee‚Äôs team in its early days.
Network is king
While ecommerce-related ventures stand out prominently among the firms that were started by ex-Sea staff, there are also a fair number of esports-related startups in the mix. The network map also shows companies in verticals such as fintech, edtech, and cryptocurrency.
A majority of these startups are still in their early days. Unlike the Gojek and Grab mafias, only a handful of these companies such as Una Brands, Hypefast, and EruidiFi seemed to have raised VC funding till early 2021.
Alumni firms like India-based decentralized finance startup Pillow and Indonesian payments provider Durianpay, which have been established more recently, seem to have more luck with funding.
While some startups haven‚Äôt disclosed the amount of funding they‚Äôve raised, most of those that have received funding are in the seed stage, confirming the nascency of Sea‚Äôs mafia entrepreneur network.


That said, the network already has a couple of heavy hitters. For instance, Jumei, a China-based online cosmetics company, went public in a US$430 million stock market debut in 2014. Meanwhile, Bitkub, a Thailand-based cryptocurrency exchange, was acquired for US$536 million in November 2021.
Some Sea alumni have also crossed over to the other side of the table. Investment firms Asia Partners and Teko Ventures were founded by Nick Nash, the former group president at Sea, and Mai Thanh Binh, who founded Garena Vietnam, respectively.
Binh, in particular, also founded Garena Vietnam in 2009 and Vietnam‚Äôs second tech unicorn VNLife two years prior in 2007.
Sea‚Äôs remarkable strides have undoubtedly given its alumni an upper hand. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easier for me to get clients because of my previous experience at Shopee ‚Äì they trust me because of that,‚Äù says Wang.
‚Äú[Shopee‚Äôs] amazing track record got us a lot of credibility when we were starting out,‚Äù says Remobie‚Äôs Zhang, whose company has sold about 150,000 units of phones in the two years it‚Äôs been around.
The alumni network is a gift that keeps on giving. Shopee‚Äôs leadership, says Zhang, continues to be caring even after he and his co-founders have moved out. ‚ÄúThey always ask how they can help us,‚Äù he says.
Some alumni say they were also able to leverage the company‚Äôs platforms, like in the case of AladdinCommerce and Remobie. The latter works with different brands ‚Äì including ones in telecom ‚Äì to run trade-in programs for phones as well as office electronics. Shopee has been partnering with Remobie for these trade-in programs since last year.
The right network may even open doors that were previously unseen. Singapore-based ecommerce aggregator Una Brands is currently hiring, and Luke Ong, an ex-Shopee team member who is part of the founding team at Una Brands, believes Sea‚Äôs alumni could be a good fit at the company.
‚ÄúThey are qualified and have worked in a high-growth startup before, so they know the difficulties and challenges that come with high-growth startups,‚Äù he says. In one of the largest seed rounds in the region, Una Brands raised US$40 million in May 2021.
Remaining hungry
Sea‚Äôs steady growth has only made this network more confident: The company‚Äôs upward trajectory comes as a reminder that they‚Äôve learned all the right to-dos of business.
Schola‚Äôs Tran says her colleagues at Garena ‚Äúwere very hungry to solve different problems.‚Äù
The word hungry comes up more than once to describe Sea‚Äôs employees in Tech in Asia‚Äôs conversations with the company‚Äôs alumni, including with Ong.
He joined Shopee in 2018 on the cross-border ecommerce team, focusing on China-based brands selling to the Singapore market.
His job involved managing brands across categories and handling returns, which offered him a chance to see how logistics worked at an ecommerce company. Incidentally, this exposure eventually led Ong to move to Ninja Van before becoming a part of Una Brands.
See also: Does the dawn of in-house ecommerce delivery threaten third-party logistics firms?
In his current role, Ong interacts with brand owners across platforms, including Shopee, Amazon, and Lazada. He says his experience at Shopee offers him ‚Äúan intimate understanding of how it works on the inside.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt has helped me understand what brand and category managers focus on while choosing to promote or not promote a brand or the mechanisms behind flash deals and brand launches,‚Äù he shares.
For ShakeDeal co-founder Hegde, working with Shopee in its early days gave him a front-row seat to how a company could be scaled up. ‚ÄúFrom building a product to taking it to market, acquiring customers, to nitty gritties of handling operations, like tying up with 3PLs (third-party logistics) and figuring out payment modes, I ingested all that from Shopee,‚Äù he says.
Among other things, Hegde also learned how significant recommendation engines can be for an ecommerce business at Shopee. These recommendation engines, he says, enable cross-selling and personalization, which can make a world of difference for ecommerce businesses.
He also saw firsthand how Shopee‚Äôs leadership, CEO Chris Feng in particular, prioritized long-term solutions over short-term fixes.
‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs a jar that‚Äôs leaking and there‚Äôs constant inflow of water, the solution isn‚Äôt just to patch up the holes but to turn off the tap. And Chris was absolutely right when he taught us that, urging us to get to the core of any problem,‚Äù recalls Hegde.
The forward march
Despite the Covid-19 pandemic, it‚Äôs been a busy time for some of Sea Group‚Äôs alumni, who have launched new startups in the period.
Not surprisingly, most of the startups Tech in Asia surveyed are in the ecommerce space, with former Shopee employees setting out to start their own ecommerce ventures. And many who were with Garena have also launched gaming-related ventures.
A few have also set up businesses in areas such as insurtech and blockchain, including Indonesia-based insurtech company Rey, minority-focused VC firm Bridge Young Things, or PathDAO, a startup that works in the blockchain gaming and metaverse spaces.


At least six companies in Southeast Asia‚Äôs crypto and blockchain-focused space have founders from the Sea alumni network. Perhaps the most prominent of these companies is Bitkub, a crypto exchange and the latest unicorn to come out of Thailand.
Singapore serves as headquarter to most firms within the Sea alumni, while Indonesia comes second.


Some Sea alumni like Wafa Taftazani have also established multiple startups in Indonesia. Having set up Modal Rakyat, a working-capital enabler for startups and SMEs, in 2018, Taftazani launched two startups in 2021. One of them is VCGamers, a gaming ecommerce platform in Indonesia, and the other is UpBanx, a fintech platform for creators and brands.
It‚Äôs a playbook that‚Äôs worked well for those who‚Äôve previously worked at Shopee. And as for Shopee itself, the ecommerce platform has also been steadily expanding outside Southeast Asia, making its foray into Latin America, Europe, and India.
And while Shopee still has to prove it can grow in its newer markets, its move to spread its tentacles bodes well for Sea‚Äôs alumni network.
What most alumni agree on is that there‚Äôs going to be a lot more startups by the Sea mafia in the next couple of years. Give it two to three years for more startups to emerge from the Sea network, says Ong, adding that the current Sea mafia might just be a precursor to the new startups waiting in the wings. Perhaps, like Sea, the startups founded or soon-to-be founded by its alumni are also baby rhinos, just biding their time.

734349,2022-03-01T02:10:58,Exclusive: Two heavy equipment startups backed by Indonesian super angel merge,"Two Indonesia-based startups, Webtrace and TraktorHub, told Tech in Asia they have merged to form a new entity called Quipster. Both companies are portfolio firms of local super angel, who has invested in many early stage startups, Prasetia Dwidharma.

Founded by Erwin Subroto, Jovian Anderson, and Denny Tjioe in 2015, Webtrace is an internet of things solution that helps companies monitor their vehicle assets. In its initial days, the startup focused on the logistics business. However, it expanded to the public transportation and heavy equipment sector.
In January, Webtrace claimed that its monitoring equipment had onboarded more than 5,000 vehicles, resulting in 500 million rupiah (around US$35,000) of monthly recurring revenue.
On the other hand, TraktorHub is a platform that helps companies rent or buy heavy equipment such as cranes, excavators, and forklifts. It was founded by Rezka Fonda, David Hartono, and Dennis Pratistha in 2018 and has served dozens of customers.
In a statement, the two companies said that they would continue to serve their respective customers, while Quipster will become a holding entity for those businesses. Webtrace‚Äôs Subroto and Tjioe will hold the position of CEO and CFO at Quipster, respectively. TraktorHub‚Äôs Hartono will be the COO.
Sharing resources
According to Subroto, the two firms were introduced by their common investor, Prasetia Dwidharma. While the talks were initially about a collaboration, the conversation eventually shifted. It turned out, some of the founders knew each other.
‚ÄúSo the chemistry was built, and we decide to advance our partnership to a strategic merger,‚Äù Subroto told Tech in Asia.
Webtrace currently has 21 employees, with most of them in the product division and technical support team. After the merger, the company‚Äôs staff will be combined with TraktorHub‚Äôs seven employees. Under the new entity, both companies will share their resources to continue supporting the two business lines.

Before the merger, both TraktorHub and Webtrace had raised seed funding. With the establishment of Quipster, they aim to raise a pre-series A round this year.
With the fresh funds, the merged entity will fuel its geographical expansion to 12 cities in Indonesia. On top of that, it also plans to build new products, such as a vehicle maintenance feature, and ink partnerships with financial firms to offer loan or insurance services.

Deepak Wadhwa, co-founder of Locofast and former product manager at MakeMytrip, told Tech in Asia that in terms of gross merchandise value, the company had grown at an average of 20% month-on-month since its launch in 2019.
To date, Locofast has onboarded more than 500 suppliers and managed the supply chain of more than 700 brands, including fashion retailers Zara and H&amp;M. The textile supply chain firm plans to grow the number of suppliers on its platform to 2,500 in the next 12 months.
Wadhwa added that the company recorded a 50x revenue growth in the last 18 months. The firm is looking to accelerate this growth further with the latest fundraise.
Moreover, the company will also expand its presence overseas soon. While it already has customers from Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, Locofast will also set up an office in the US soon.

Hello reader,
For employees, it‚Äôs only natural to seek out greener pastures. The brutal reality is that all of us have bills to pay and aspirations to achieve, so when new opportunities come knocking on our doors ‚Äì offering better salaries or career progression ‚Äì it often makes sense to welcome them with open arms.
That was perhaps the case for several former employees of Capital A (formerly known as AirAsia) and MyTukar. A fair number of ex-staff from the two companies are now employed by Malaysian used-car platform Carsome, an occurrence that some say was not a coincidence.
Today we look at:

The key executives that Capital A and MyTukar lost to Carsome in 2021

AirAsia rebranded itself earlier this year as Capital A and is bolstering its super-app ambitions. Meanwhile, MyTukar, the Malaysian unit of Singaporean automotive marketplace Carro, underwent a reorganization and is looking to grow its market share soon. This has led to a change in leadership and some employees jumping ship at the two firms. A notable number of their ex-staff have joined Carsome, Malaysia‚Äôs first unicorn.


From the numbers: Tech in Asia has found that about 13 junior and senior executives from AirAsia‚Äôs marketing and tech divisions, as well as 12 junior and senior staff from MyTukar‚Äôs business development division, left to join Carsome in 2021.


Not a coincidence: A former AirAsia employee with knowledge of the matter says these movements were unique, as many who left the airline claimed to have been poached by Carsome, which wanted to beef up its digital marketing and tech units. Insiders familiar with the matter also tell Tech in Asia that they knew that Carsome had made offers to a number of MyTukar staff across different divisions.


But not on purpose?: Carsome has denied targeting talent ‚Äúfrom any company,‚Äù with a spokesperson telling Tech in Asia that ‚Äúthere is no attempt as alleged.‚Äù

Hello reader,
With Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine driving the knife deeper into languishing global stock markets, we decided to take a look at those brave enough to make their debut amid bearish red flags.
The IPO market isn‚Äôt exactly hot right now, with a few new issuers either delaying or trimming the size of their listings. But that hasn‚Äôt stopped swathes of high-profile IPOs from quietly simmering under the surface.
Asian tech companies have been doing plenty of IPO-related groundwork recently ‚Äì from changes in citizenship to drawing executives from competitors. A closer look at the scene will reveal the various approaches these firms are taking.

For instance, Shein, the fast-fashion giant, appears to be doing whatever it can to bypass China‚Äôs tougher rules for offshore IPOs.
Not only did the retailer shift its parent firm to Singapore ‚Äì similar to the move made by super app Grab (GRAB, NDAQ) ‚Äì but its founder and CEO, Chris Xu, also became a permanent resident of the city-state. These developments come following reports that suggested Shein was looking to list in New York later this year.
Meanwhile, IPO-bound FinAccel, the parent company of Kredivo, an Indonesia-based buy now, pay later service, has stoked investor interest by taking the M&amp;A route. FinAccel raised its stake in Bank Bisnis Internasional (BBSI, IDX) from 40% to 75% in a bid to claim a chunk of Indonesia‚Äôs fast-growing digibank market.
Akulaku, another fintech unicorn heading for the public market, managed to line its coffers by raising US$100 million in a series E round. However, that wasn‚Äôt the case for Alibaba (BABA, NDAQ), which shelved plans to raise US$1 billion for Lazada before Southeast Asian firm‚Äôs IPO.
The bad news doesn‚Äôt end there for the Chinese ecommerce giant as it posted its slowest revenue growth since going public last week. You can find a detailed review of Alibaba‚Äôs financial health here.
Carousell, on the other hand, offered a glimpse into its financial performance in the lead-up to its debut on the public market, which might happen as soon as this current quarter. In this premium story, we break down the key aspects of the online classifieds firm‚Äôs 2020 earnings result.
Carsome, Carousell‚Äôs competitor in the automobile space, has been beefing up its digital marketing and tech units in a peculiar manner. Malaysia‚Äôs first unicorn has been gearing up to dive into public markets this year and, as my colleague Emmanuel reports in this premium story, it has made a habit of luring a host of junior and senior staff from rival firms.
Most companies prefer to keep their IPO plans on the down-low, but Singapore-based PropertyGuru doesn‚Äôt beat around the bush. Despite having already announced the firm‚Äôs intention to list in the US last year, PropertyGuru‚Äôs CEO went a step further to confirm that the listing will take place by the end of the first quarter this year.

üáÆüá≥ Vodafone Idea Ltd (IDEA, NSE):  The troubled telecommunications firms could be in line for a much-need capital infusion after British parent Vodafone Group said it plans to sell up to a 5% stake in tower firm Indus Towers to Bharti Airtel (BHARTIARTL, NSE). ‚ÄúThe two sides are in discussions and things could move very fast in the next few weeks,‚Äù a source told The Economic Times.
üá®üá≥ Baidu Inc (BIDU, NYSE): Despite initially feeling the full force of China‚Äôs crackdown, the tech giant has managed to weather the storm to some extent, with its shares shedding just around 2.5% over the last six months. The Chinese search engine has reportedly laid off nearly 10% to 15% of its total employees.
The question on everyone‚Äôs minds is whether Baidu can now shift gears and reverse its fortunes. A few answers are likely when it reports its Q4 results on March 1.

VR headsets and insurance: There has been a lot of distressing news (pandemic, wars, inflation, and so on) in the headlines lately. Amid the doom and gloom, news that Sony Group (6758, TYO) had revealed the design for its next-generation PlayStation VR2 headset went largely under the radar.
Tech advancements in virtual reality hardware have accelerated. However, regardless of how immersive the experience is, players of VR games are still inescapably rooted in the physical world. When gamers forget that, bad things happen (in other words, expensive equipment gets broken). Hard to believe? Well, insurance claims in the UK that mention VR headsets jumped 31% in 2021.

734484,2022-02-28T05:00:23,The Philippines: Asia‚Äôs next crypto hub?,"The Philippines‚Äô crypto companies are being overlooked by the country‚Äôs ‚Äúmainstream‚Äù startups.
That‚Äôs the opinion of Colin Goltra, COO of play-to-earn (P2E) gaming startup Yield Guild Games (YGG). The Filipino American expressed his ‚Äúoccasional frustrations with how the Philippine startup scene is portrayed‚Äù to Tech in Asia.

He believes that the country‚Äôs billion-dollar investment outcomes are being ignored, thanks to a startup ecosystem that is largely driven by ‚Äúcorporate VCs that have conservative investment mandates.‚Äù These investors tend to miss what‚Äôs happening in the crypto world, which he says has become ‚Äúsuch a major source of innovation‚Äù in the Philippines.
Indeed, more crypto startups in the country are becoming prominent and securing money at rising valuations.
Nichel Gaba, founder and CEO of Philippine Digital Asset Exchange (PDAX), echoes this view and cited how Covid-19 was a catalyst for this development. ‚ÄúThe pandemic, as horrible as it is, created the ideal setting for a technology like crypto to come to the fore. The industry was able to showcase the power of decentralization because the centralized structures weren‚Äôt working well.‚Äù
Among the up-and-comers are familiar names that have been around since the early 2010s and newer players that are flying under the radar but securing sizable funding.
These include YGG and non-fungible token generator BreederDAO, the first two Philippines-based companies to receive funding from Silicon Valley VC Andreessen Horowitz (a16z).

A16z‚Äôs investments in BreederDAO and YGG, in particular, have boosted interest¬†in crypto among the country‚Äôs investors and entrepreneurs and are ‚Äúencouraging more locals to explore this space,‚Äù says Joan Yao, vice president of investments at local VC Kickstart Ventures.
Kickstart is an early investor in Coins.ph, one of the first blockchain-powered platforms to break into the Philippines‚Äô mainstream consumer market.
‚ÄúLocal‚Äù crypto startups still matter
Given the borderless nature of cryptocurrencies, many startups in the space have remote teams ‚Äì it doesn‚Äôt matter where the founders are from.
Indeed, some crypto startups that once considered making Singapore their headquarters are now heading to cities like Dubai for this very reason.
See also: Is Dubai stealing Singapore‚Äôs thunder in crypto?
That said, crypto startups still place a premium on being close to their customers and users, and crypto adoption still requires distinctly local approaches.
In the Philippines, crypto ownership is growing. About 4% of the population ‚Äì or 4.36 million people ‚Äì own some crypto, according to research by TripleA. In 2021, the Philippines made it to the top 20 countries in Chanalysis‚Äô Global Crypto Adoption Index, which measures peer-to-peer exchange trade volume, on-chain value received, and on-chain retail value received.
What ties many Filipino crypto startups together is the use of blockchain to address real-world needs in a country with weak financial inclusion and a population battered by the pandemic‚Äôs economic blows.
At 47%, the Philippines has the second-biggest unbanked population in Southeast Asia. Combine that with the country‚Äôs high mobile penetration rate of 138%, and fintech startups have found plenty of opportunities to leapfrog the banking system by putting crypto wallets into people‚Äôs hands.

Lower incomes and rising unemployment due to Covid-19 have also helped push crypto adoption through P2E games.
Before the pandemic, wages and salary employment in the Philippines were growing. But the global health crisis reversed these gains, ‚Äúwiping out 1.7 million wage and salary jobs in the 12 months to January 2021‚Äù and driving about 435,000 to find work in the informal sector, according to the Asian Development Bank.
Playing Axie Infinity, a P2E game created by Vietnam-based Sky Mavis, became a lifeline for many Filipinos. The real minimum wage in the country currently stands at 493.57 pesos (US$9.61) a day in the National Capital Region and can go as low as 266.32 (US$5) in the provinces. In contrast, Axie Infinity players were earning as much as 6,000 pesos (around US$117) a day in 2021, although that rate proved to be unsustainable.

YGG was instrumental in growing Axie Infinity‚Äôs popularity. After seeing how P2E gaming gave Filipinos a financial boost, Gabby Dizon ‚Äúcame up with the idea of creating a global network of players helping each other get started with NFT games.‚Äù That‚Äôs how YGG was born.

Dizon built YGG at a time when NFTs ‚Äì especially NFT games ‚Äì were far from mainstream. ‚ÄúWe had to put a lot of effort into spreading awareness and education about the use cases of NFT gaming and how it can revolutionize gaming, together with the impact it can create in society,‚Äù the co-founder adds.
For many players, P2E introduced them to the fast-moving, volatile world of crypto. Says Dizon, ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt learn crypto by trading, learning derivatives, or doing enterprise blockchain. Here, people are learning it through gaming first.‚Äù
See also: A16z‚Äôs first Philippine bet is shaking up blockchain gaming
As more people got into crypto through P2E, the demand rose for services that would allow them to cash out or spend their digital assets on more tangible things. Companies like PDAX are working to make this process seamless.
‚ÄúNobody teleports into the crypto space. You go from your Philippine pesos from the real economy, into the digital economy,‚Äù says Gaba of PDAX.
To that end, XLD Finance has built an app that lets people pay for bills using stablecoins or SLP ‚Äì aka small love potion, the in-game currency of Axie Infinity.
YGG‚Äôs Goltra adds that the Philippines‚Äô comfort level with English, a positive-sum culture of its crypto scene, and a central bank that has clear crypto regulations and a progressive stance towards the tech have contributed to the rise of these blockchain startups in the country.
More investors are taking crypto seriously
Crypto founders report that in the past two years, raising funds has become easier.
Perhaps it‚Äôs a sign that investors are more comfortable with crypto.
It also reflects the wider trend of US investors being more open to backing Southeast Asian startups due to the lower valuations as well as the global mandate of crypto-centric VCs.
And then there‚Äôs the fact that money in alternative assets has been at an all-time high, at least until the US Federal Reserve announced that it would hike interest rates.
Gaba of PDAX says that fundraising was a lot harder in 2018 than it was in 2020, and a lot of it had to do with how much money there was to go around.

PDAX founder and CEO Nichel Gaba / Photo credit: PDAX

‚ÄúIn 2020 and 2021, when it was becoming clear that markets were more receptive towards crypto, there was more capital deployed to funds that invest in crypto initiatives or crypto startups,‚Äù he observes.
Before 2020, PDAX was primarily targeted by regional VCs, Filipino angel investors, and strategic partners supportive of fintech. ‚ÄúBut by 2021, we started seeing more of the global mega funds look at crypto,‚Äù he says.
YGG‚Äôs first funding round in 2020 was also a bit difficult because NFTs were not yet well understood, but the company quickly gained traction with the help of crypto-focused funds Scalar Capital, Delphi Digital, and Gumi Cryptos Capital. Dizon says that the guild‚Äôs fundraising initiatives were much easier because of this support.
Traditional VCs are starting to do more in crypto, but they still face barriers in doing so.
See also: Are SEA‚Äôs tech VCs missing out on the crypto craze?
Although big funding rounds led by foreign VCs get hyped up, Yao of Kickstart Ventures notes that there are also ‚Äúlocal investors who have made many crypto investments without media attention.‚Äù
More work, however, needs to be done as most VCs in the Philippines still don‚Äôt typically support gaming companies, Dizon says.
Growing pains
The rapid growth of startups in this space is not without challenges.
For one, first-time crypto holders need better financial literacy and security awareness to make sure they manage their wealth well and avoid scams.
The rise of P2E ‚Äì and the resulting media frenzy ‚Äì has also caught the tax collector‚Äôs attention, although no firm decision has been made about taxing the earnings from such games.
And despite the receptiveness of¬† the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) toward crypto, more regulation may be coming. The country‚Äôs central bank has tightened the rules governing crypto assets in response to the sector‚Äôs rapid growth.

Released in January 2021, the guidelines outline licensing requirements for virtual asset service providers ‚Äì companies that offer financial services using blockchain, Bitcoin, digital currencies, and the like ‚Äì to protect against money laundering.
Gaba thinks that the most notable addition to earlier frameworks seems to be the ‚Äútravel rule.‚Äù In traditional finance, the rule requires institutions that facilitate money transfers to know who‚Äôs sending the money, why they‚Äôre sending it, and who‚Äôs receiving it. Regulators are trying to do the same for cryptocurrencies.
‚ÄúIf you withdraw crypto, the exchange should know where you‚Äôre sending it to or to whom. But with crypto, it could be to yourself, so the exchange needs to be able to make that distinction. That‚Äôs where the rules are now. A lot of these things are being clarified not just in the Philippines but also globally,‚Äù Gaba explains.
The future for crypto startups
The popularity of P2E will likely continue to support growth in other areas of crypto.
BSP-licensed crypto exchanges are offering direct pairings between P2E tokens such as Axie Infinity‚Äôs SLP and AXS for a smoother on/off ramp experience. Digital banks are also keeping an eye on this community because of the growth it has showcased in the past year,‚Äù says Dizon.
Local gaming guilds will be key to sustaining the growth of P2E in the Philippines. These organizations work to attract more users and recruit community managers, reach remote players, and secure local partnerships for fiat cashout.
Digital assets in general could also see use cases beyond financial services, art, and gaming.
Gaba believes that blockchain could mirror the internet‚Äôs journey. ‚ÄúIn the ‚Äò90s, the internet was seen mainly as an innovation in media ‚Äì everyone would get to broadcast information. But right now, you have commerce, financial services, and all sorts of things happening on the internet. But the entry point was media.‚Äù
On the other hand, financial services was ‚Äúwhere it all started‚Äù for crypto. ‚ÄúSatoshi Nakamoto invented Bitcoin as a solution for challenges in the monetary system ‚Ä¶ But now, we can do so many things with it,‚Äù Gaba concludes.

Hi readers,
Have you ever gone for an interview or took a test and left the room feeling like you did a pretty good job, only to find out that you‚Äôd flunked it?
I imagine that‚Äôs how many crypto hopefuls in Singapore must feel.
Over 170 firms pursued a digital payments token license in the city-state when the Monetary Authority of Singapore  started accepting applications in early 2020. But since then, an overwhelming number of these applicants have been either rejected or asked to withdraw.
While rejection is part of doing business, many contenders say they don‚Äôt know why they failed even after a rigorous process that stretched to over a year and involved multiple conversations with the regulator. Many can only guess at the reasons.
Here‚Äôs what I think: In the high-stakes game of crypto, there‚Äôs little incentive for any country or jurisdiction to be a pioneer. A second or third mover, sure. But to be the first? There‚Äôs too much on the line, given crypto‚Äôs high volatility and reputation as a speculative asset as well as money laundering risks.
It‚Äôs no wonder why regulators all over the world are being extra cautious. Obtaining a stamp of legitimacy is a huge deal for any crypto operator and could usher in a flood of newcomers and users onto a platform.
Till then, it seems that firms will hop from market to market in their search for regulatory approval. And at the moment, Dubai seems pretty high on their list.

Toyotsu Binter, one of the firms in the consortium looking to buy the car marketplace, is a joint venture between Singapore tire distributor Binter &amp; Co and Toyota Group‚Äôs trading arm Toyota Tsusho. The venture focuses on selling tires and commercial auto parts.

Hello reader,
A few years ago, my parents decided that they wanted to buy a new sofa set. They did, and when the new sofas arrived, we had to figure out what to do with the old ones. They were still in pretty good condition despite us having sat on them for nearly 10 years, and it seemed like such a waste to put them in the dumpster.
So we turned to Carousell, listed the sofa set for something like a hundred bucks, and had a buyer lined up and ready to go within hours.
The Singapore-based classifieds firm is the go-to place for many people to buy and sell pre-loved items, but it‚Äôs also become so much more. Carousell has grown tremendously since it was launched back in 2012, and the road ahead for it seems like an exciting one.
Today we look at:

Diving into Carousell‚Äôs finances

Image credit: Timmy Loen

Carousell is reportedly in talks to go public via a special purpose acquisition company this year, with the joint entity valued at US$1.5 billion. While the region‚Äôs tech and startup scene waits to see if this will come to pass, let‚Äôs take a look at Carousell‚Äôs numbers for its financial year ending December 31, 2020.


Gains and losses: In 2020, the online classifieds giant reported a revenue of US$40.6 million, a more than 3x increase from 2019. Its acquisition of 701Search ‚Äì the marketplace behind Mudah in Malaysia, Cho Tot in Vietnam, and OneKyat in Myanmar ‚Äì likely drove a bulk of that growth. At the same time, Carousell‚Äôs losses before taxes deepened from US$42.2 million to US$63.9 million as its employee headcount ballooned.


The price of acquisition: Carousell is increasingly feeling the weight of running a sprawling business. Between 2019 and 2020, the firm‚Äôs employee benefits expenses roughly doubled to US$62.6 million. It also saw an increase in expenses on salaries, commissions, and bonuses, growing over 40% to US$32.4 million in the same period.


Time will tell: Carousell stands to benefit from a trend toward ‚Äúrecommerce‚Äù ‚Äì or reverse commerce. The revenue potential of the firm‚Äôs recent acquisitions, which could open up new revenue streams for the company, have also not yet been reflected in its financial statements.

In the connected world we live in, it‚Äôs important for businesses to reach customers beyond their own home markets. That‚Äôs where Vietnamese cross-border ecommerce startup OpenCommerce Group (OCG) comes into the picture ‚Äì and it‚Äôs just raised US$7 million in a series A round led by gaming and entertainment unicorn VNG to help it on its journey.


Founded in 2014, OCG aims to make it easier for local entrepreneurs and SMEs to sell their products to global consumers. Its suite of solutions also includes tools for order management, marketing, shipping, and payments, among other things.


To date, the company has facilitated transactions worth US$2 billion. Headquartered in Hanoi, the firm also has offices in San Francisco and Shenzhen.


The fresh funding will go toward improving its products, bolstering its expansion into other markets in Southeast Asia, and gaining more market share in China.

The rise of fraud in Southeast Asia

Southeast Asia is in its digital age, and there‚Äôs an abundance of services and solutions ‚Äì think easy digital payments, promotions, and fuss-free customer experiences ‚Äì that allow people to freely transact online.
These developments have benefited customers, but they‚Äôve also created opportunities for bad actors to come in and defraud businesses. A survey conducted by GrabDefence and Forrester found that seven out of 10 organizations in Southeast Asia reported experiencing fraud in the last 12 months, which cost them both financially and reputationally.
Given this new reality, businesses are at a crossroads: How can they best prevent fraud while ensuring that customer journeys stay as friction-free as possible?
Find out how at GrabDefence‚Äôs upcoming webinar, The State of Fraud in Southeast Asia 2022: Insights To Protect Your Business. Scheduled on March 23, the event will feature industry experts who will discuss the region‚Äôs fraud landscape, key insights from the survey report, and recommendations to enhance fraud management capabilities.

734548,2022-02-25T05:26:50,This SPH veteran spun off his jobs platform to catch a big wave,"Julian Tan is not a new name in the startup ecosystem of Southeast Asia, especially in Singapore.
More than a decade ago, he started and grew several startups under local media organization Singapore Press Holdings (SPH), such as classified ads platform 701Search ‚Äì parent company of Berniaga in Indonesia and Mudah.my in Malaysia ‚Äì and automotive portal SgCarMart.
Last year, he decided to spin off startup FastCo from SPH to make the company, which operates blue-collar jobs platform FastJobs, an independent firm. According to Tan, the service has gained good traction and has become one of the top jobs platforms in Singapore, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It currently has more than 450,000 monthly active job seekers on the platform.
Recently, the company also launched another app called FastGig that focuses on job seekers who want to operate on a more flexible schedule. For example, job seekers can declare that they only want to work two days per week and only in the morning, and the app will match them with suitable employers.


According to the firm, FastJobs‚Äô revenue has been growing steadily, while its operating losses have narrowed. It hit US$2.4 million in revenue in 2020, a 14% surge compared to the previous year. At the same time, the company‚Äôs EBIT¬†losses shrunk by 58% to US$162,000.
In a statement, the company said that in 2021, it succeeded in doubling its 2020 revenue, making its last year revenue roughly around¬†US$4.8 million.
Tan says he decided to spin off the company from SPH because of the huge interest it was getting from investors who wanted to support the business. At the same time, he realized that the jobs space was heating up all around the world, with the emergence of SoftBank-backed Jobandtalent in Europe, Workstream in the US, and even Sampingan and MyRobin in Indonesia.
To accommodate the changing environment, Tan restructured the firm‚Äôs shareholders.
‚ÄúToday, we have myriad of shareholders, from SPH, venture capitalists, angel investors, as well as the management,‚Äù Tan tells Tech in Asia. ‚ÄúWe hope it can make the company more agile, grow, and compete as a startup in the region.‚Äù
His own baby
Tan has run 701Search and has led its expansion across Southeast Asia since 2008. He was also involved when the company‚Äôs Indonesian subsidiary, Berniaga, was acquired by online marketplace OLX in 2014. A year later, Tan went back to SPH to run the media company‚Äôs digital businesses.
This is when Tan cooked up the idea for FastCo. ‚ÄúI tried to think what else I can do so I‚Äôm able to contribute my learning in building a startup in the region,‚Äù he recalls.
He was aware that there were already so many job portals in Singapore, such as JobStreet, JobsDB, and even LinkedIn. However, he believed those platforms mostly only catered to the white-collar space.
‚ÄúThere is an underserved market of non-executive blue-collar workers. And based on my experience of building my previous startup in this region, the segment is the majority of the workforce.‚Äù

FastCo founder Julian Tan (second from left) with his team / Photo credit: FastCo

Tan built FastCo under SPH in 2015, and it took only a year for it to become the top blue-collar job platform in Singapore, he says. Aware of the potential, he established a separate entity for the company in 2018 and started expanding to Malaysia and the Philippines. SPH was still the majority shareholder at the time.
Tan admits that there was a personal factor behind his decision to run the company by himself. ‚ÄúThis is the baby that I started. It‚Äôs not a thing that we acquired or invested ‚Äì we did everything by ourselves,‚Äù he explains.
According to VentureCap Insights, FastCo raised US$3.9 million in Q3 2018 and US$3.4 million in Q2 last year. However, the data showed that SPH Interactive still holds a 50% stake in the company after those two rounds of funding.
In a statement, FastCo said that it now operates independently as a result of a management buyout that was led by VC firm Cento Ventures last year. The process itself is a multistep transaction that is still ongoing. When fully diluted, the stake of SPH Interactive will be around a third of the company.
Refuse to be static
The focus of FastCo is still on growing the number of job seekers and corporate clients on the platform, as well as learning how to match the two parties correctly.
The company currently has a strong position in the F&amp;B, retail, warehousing, logistics, and physical security sectors. Going forward, FastCo wants to increase the number of employers and job seekers in those sectors, while expanding to jobs in other businesses such as beauty and wellness.

Based on his experience, Tan says that the key to success in a startup is making sure that the business model isn‚Äôt static. A traditional classifieds platform, for instance, mostly stuck to just connecting supply and demand without trying to go deeper into the transaction, he says.
‚ÄúMeanwhile, we see newer startups such as automotive portals Carro and Carsome, which already take care of the transaction,‚Äù Tan shares.
That‚Äôs why FastCo is innovating to sustain its leadership position and has launched FastGig. The new app targets people who have particular needs in a job setup, such as students and stay-at-home parents. It can also handle payments and make it easier for job seekers to choose a suitable shift.
NTUC FairPrice, Domino‚Äôs Pizza Singapore, and Phoon Huat have used FastGig to scale their operations during peak times, such as Christmas and the Lunar New Year, according to a statement. Since its launch, the app has fulfilled more than 160,000 work hours for these employers.

Another service that FastCo tested in Singapore is a learning feature called FastLearn, where jobseekers can attend training courses to improve their skills.
Series A funding in the works
FastCo is now working on its series A round, which will be its first fundraise after¬†the spin-off from SPH. ‚ÄúWe have started the process last year and are set to close it in the next few months,‚Äù Tan shares.
While the founder wants to operate in the entire Southeast Asia market, like what he did in the past with 701 Search, he says the company will focus on its existing markets for this year.
‚ÄúAfter we can be the clear market leader, we will consider to go to other countries,‚Äù Tan says.
The biggest challenge for FastCo right now is hiring high-quality talent, both in the product and sales divisions. It currently has around 60 employees, with half of them based in Singapore and a quarter each in Malaysia and the Philippines.",Aditya Hadi Pratama,Collin Furtado and Jaclyn Tiu,0,"['News', 'Premium Content', 'Profiles', 'Startups']",True,True,5

732241,2022-02-25T02:00:26,Optimizing data for strategic decision making in business,"The rapid development of tech and increased access to various digital services have resulted in a significant rise in the amount of data we produce. This has made large institutions realize that the value of data has changed and that information can influence decision-making, which has spurred many of these firms to transform into data-driven organizations.¬†
However, making this shift is not easy. According to an Accenture survey, only 32% of organizations have gained tangible value from data. This means that there are still large gaps to overcome before companies can optimize the data they gather.
One of these challenges is building a tech foundation that can process large amounts of information, as the data an organization collects through tech is multistructured.
Google‚Äôs answer to this need is Google Cloud. The cloud computing solution transforms data, enabling companies to get optimized data value via a single intelligently enabled platform to get optimized data value.
Last October, at the 2021 Google Cloud Next event, the tech giant introduced several new developments and improvements to its services, including BigQuery and Vertex AI.
Both services were highlighted in the Innovate and Accelerate with Data Cloud panel, which discussed how organizations can simplify and unify data to optimize it and, in turn, increase enterprise productivity using Google Cloud solutions.
Improvements to BigQuery

BigQuery is a data warehouse that provides solutions for Google Cloud services and can help companies manage and analyze data. With the service, companies don‚Äôt have to think about infrastructure and can focus on data analysis to generate reliable insights.
Three main improvements were added to BigQuery: the BigQuery interoperability feature, BigQuery Migration Service and Management (currently under preview), and the real-time and predictive analytics process.
The interoperability feature sets BigQuery apart from other data warehouses. This feature can help data teams analyze data faster, as it allows them to seamlessly connect and exchange information with various types of services.
For example, the platform uses BigQuery Storage API, which provides a simpler architecture that requires less data movement, removing the need to have multiple copies of the same information stored in different places. There is also BigQuery Omni, a fully managed enterprise data warehouse that integrates Google Cloud solutions with other cloud services such as Azure and Amazon Web Services, which allows companies to perform analysis without moving the data from other cloud platforms to the Google Cloud platform.
The BigQuery Migration Service and Management feature targets data engineers who are new to BigQuery. This solution can help users migrate data quickly, affordably, and with low risk, so they can immediately modernize data as needed.
For those who are already using BigQuery, the BigQuery Administration feature helps users monitor resource usage in real-time.
According to Google, BigQuery Storage API‚Äôs real-time process analytics capabilities are continuously improved to help users get faster results. As for predictive analytics, Google Cloud‚Äôs Explainable AI service can clarify how each feature contributes to the prediction results and helps identify biases in the model.
Vertex AI upgrades

Vertex AI is designed specifically for developers and brings Google‚Äôs machine learning tools together on one platform. This makes the experimentation and deployment process faster while simplifying AI model management.
Since its launch in May 2021, Vertex AI has seen adoption rise consistently. It has witnessed a threefold increase in total API requests, a 70% rise in total training volume, and an increase in total prediction volume by 2x.
Three features of the service were highlighted at the 2021 Google Next event, namely Vertex AI Metadata, Vertex AI Pipeline, and Vertex AI Neural Architecture Search (NAS).
Vertex AI Metadata makes it easier to audit and manage the machine learning model workflows that are under development and automatically tracks inputs and outputs to all components.
When a machine learning model is in production, input data can sometimes deviate from what a model is trained on, which causes the model to deteriorate. Vertex AI‚Äôs Model Monitoring feature reviews the model and warns developers of deviant signals, diagnoses the cause of deviations, and triggers retraining paths or collects relevant training data.
The Vertex AI Pipeline, on the other hand, helps automate, monitor, and manage machine learning systems by setting up serverless workflows and storing workflow outputs ‚Äì often called artifacts ‚Äì using Vertex AI Metadata. This way, users can analyze workflow artifacts such as machine learning model pedigrees, which may include training data, hyperparameters, and the code used to build the model.
Meanwhile, Vertex AI NAS can optimize neural networks, enabling machine learning experts to perform complex tasks with higher accuracy, lower latency, and lower power requirements without human intervention.
The recently launched Vertex AI Workbench, which is now under public review, is another addition to the Vertex AI service. It is an AI development environment for data scientists that helps them increase the speed of distribution of machine learning models.
With this service, data practitioners can analyze all their data in BigQuery with a single interface, letting them build and test machine learning models 5x faster than on a regular laptop.
Data in decision making
The saying that data is the new oil in the digital era is not an exaggeration. Like oil, raw and unstructured data has no value. Its value will only be seen when the data is collected thoroughly, connected to other relevant information, and analyzed properly at the right time.
If companies can learn and know how to collect data appropriately, the information can play an important role in directing their business development efforts.

When I was still in school, some of my more financially savvy friends urged me to invest my money instead of leaving it in a bank account. Knowing that I was essentially living from allowance to allowance, my friends suggested that I ‚Äústart small‚Äù as it was more important to begin early. Alas, I did not follow through on their advice because I was too lazy to do research and my finances were stretched too thinly.
However, that‚Äôs not a mistake most businesses will make (hopefully). Even if the amount is small, backing the right ventures can often lead to outstanding rewards. In today‚Äôs story, we discuss how Modalku and Carro are doing just that with their investment in Jakarta-based Bank Index.

This link provides a possible explanation for their interest in Bank Index: Eko Kurniadi, a partner at the VC firm, was previously the vice president of investment at private equity company Creador Capital, which in turn owns about 20% of Bank Index. However, it remains unclear whether Alpha JWC Ventures was involved in this deal.


In good company: The investment puts Modalku and Carro in the company of Kazanah Indexindo, Bank Index‚Äôs majority owner. The nearly 30-year-old bank reported 367 billion rupiah (US$255.6 million) in revenue and 90 billion rupiah (US$6.3 million) in profits for 2018.

Startup spotlight
A breath of fresh Aera

Singapore-based Aera VC is looking to stem the tide of worsening environmental conditions by funding startups that focus on climate-related innovations. Founded in 2016 by Derek Handley and Nick Winstone, the firm recently raised US$30 million for a new fund dedicated to this reason.


From east to west: Aera VC currently has several firms in its investment portfolio, including US chemical tech company Solugen as well as Singapore‚Äôs Shiok Meats and Australia-based Fabled Food, which both specialize in alternative meats. ‚ÄúOur long-term vision is about investing across the sustainability spectrum by backing breakthrough technologies that reverse climate change, whether they spawn from blockchain innovations or through scientific discoveries,‚Äù said Handley.


The path ahead: Using this new fund, Aera VC plans to make investments in 30 seed and follow-on rounds over the next two years, with subscriptions from institutional investors still open for up to US$100 million this year.


Aera Force One: It has also launched an investment DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) called Aera Force. The DAO currently holds 2,000 ether or ETH (about US$6 million) to be used for blockchain-powered climate and carbon solutions. Investors looking to contribute to the DAO can do so by purchasing investment tickets worth 10 ETH (about US$27,000), which are represented as NFTs designed by artist Kenneth Alexander.

The investment follows EDPR‚Äôs S$1.1 billion (US$813 million) acquisition of Singapore-based greentech firm Sunseap, announced in November last year.

The acquisition will see the two firms leverage each other‚Äôs prowess in the green energy space. EDPR and Sunseap aim to launch multiple renewable energy projects across the Asia-Pacific region, focusing on solar and wind energy sources. They will also explore opportunities in energy storage and green hydrogen.
Following the acquisition, Sunseap founders will join EDPR‚Äôs top management team for the region and lead the business.
EDPR said that the Sunseap acquisition is in line with the former‚Äôs strategy for Asia Pacific, which has witnessed an increasing demand for renewable energy. This surge is primarily driven by a growing number of projects in China, India, and Australia. Investments in the region‚Äôs renewables sector could double to US$1.3 trillion by 2030, according to global energy research and consultancy group Wood Mackenzie.
‚ÄúWith EDPR‚Äôs financial muscle and expertise in renewables, Sunseap will be able to accelerate growth plans and revolutionize the energy landscape in the region, as well as nurture the next generation of talents in the industry,‚Äù Sunseap co-founder Frank Phuan said in a statement.

734229,2022-02-24T07:00:44,Inside Indonesia‚Äôs booming e-fulfillment space and decoding Dmonstudio,"Welcome to The Checkout! Delivered every Thursday via email and through the Tech in Asia website, this free newsletter breaks down the biggest stories and trends in ecommerce. If you‚Äôre not a subscriber, get access by registering here.
Hi there,
In ecommerce, fulfillment makes all the difference. Customers stick around when deliveries are quicker, and 50% of them don‚Äôt return if the delivery experience is subpar.
Yet, fulfillment costs make up an nearly 70% of a typical ecommerce order on average. Throw in sophisticated storage infrastructure and complex logistic networks, and the price of fulfillment could skyrocket.
That hasn‚Äôt fazed players in Indonesia‚Äôs burgeoning e-fulfillment industry, though. From ecommerce heavyweights like Tokopedia and Bukalapak to industry outsiders, everyone wants to have skin in the game.
Still, e-fulfillment can be a cutthroat game. In this week‚Äôs Big Story, my colleague, Jofie Yordan, highlights Indonesia‚Äôs booming e-fulfilment industry and digs into what it takes to thrive in it.
Our Hot Take this week takes a look at Dmonstudio‚Äôs sudden closure and what it means for ByteDance. Rather than being a setback, it‚Äôs another step forward in the Chinese tech giant‚Äôs ecommerce experiment.

THE BIG STORYIn Indonesia, a rising niche in ecommerce: e-fulfilment

While the ecommerce marketplaces offer these services in-house, a rising crop of third-party players are coming up.

THE HOT TAKEWhy ByteDance shut down its Shein clone

Image credit: Gearrice

Here‚Äôs what happened:

Dmonstudio, the fast-fashion platform reportedly launched by TikTok to take on industry titan Shein, ceased operations abruptly on February 11.
While both Dmonstudio and ByteDance have not commented on the sudden closure, industry observers suggest that weak user adoption and supply chain inefficiencies were to blame.
Rather than sounding the death knell for ByteDance‚Äôs ecommerce ambitions, Dmonstudio‚Äôs closure hints at a maturing strategy that‚Äôs still taking shape.

Here‚Äôs our take:
When news of Dmonstudio‚Äôs launch first broke, it had all the signs of an epic showdown in the making.
Reportedly helmed by Kang Zeyu, ByteDance‚Äôs head of ecommerce, Dmonstudio was billed as an ‚ÄúS-level‚Äù project with the potential to topple Shein‚Äôs dominance in fast fashion. According to Pandaily, ByteDance-backed firm poached nearly 100 people from Shein to kick-start its operations.
However, this clash of titans never came to be. Dmonstudio fizzled out after just 101 days in operation and abruptly shut shop on February 11.
What went wrong? Both ByteDance and Dmonstudio are still keeping mum, but industry observers Tech in Asia spoke with suggested that weak user adoption was to blame. Data from Chinese ecommerce information platform Ebrun indicates that Dmonstudio saw only 8,000 daily visitors and 16,400 daily web page views before it closed its doors.
There‚Äôs also another reason for ByteDance‚Äôs ‚Äúrapid retreat.‚Äù While the tech titan could easily emulate Shein‚Äôs online user experience and rapidly build a founding team by dangling generous salary packages, it will likely struggle with replicating the supply chain that makes Shein a fast-fashion powerhouse.
It‚Äôs plausible that ByteDance could acquire logistics players if it can‚Äôt stomach the do-it-yourself approach. The company recently invested in iMile Delivery LLC, a Dubai-based logistics chain startup.
Even then, building a network of warehouses and in-housing logistics also goes against the grain of ByteDance‚Äôs ecommerce pursuits. To date, the company has only dabbled in platform- and app-driven plays.
Dubbing it a ‚Äúretreat while the going‚Äôs still good,‚Äù Jingzhe Research‚Äôs Bai Lu claims that ByteDance had figured out how to bring in steady traffic but not how to rapidly scale up supply chain systems. He adds that it ‚Äúmakes sense‚Äù for ByteDance to abandon Dmonstudio and focus on other asset-light ecommerce pursuits like Douyin Box and the newly launched Fanno ecommerce app instead.
If that‚Äôs the case, why did Dmonstudio emulate Shein in the first place? Did it take cues from fast fashion‚Äôs greatest just to hit a brick wall it knew it would come up against?
Maybe that‚Äôs the point. Rather than being a Shein killer, Dmonstudio is simply ByteDance‚Äôs latest experiment as the tech giant looks to refine its ecommerce strategy:

In 2014, ByteDance launched ‚Äúdaily special promotions‚Äù on its news app Toutiao to lukewarm response.
In 2016, it buddied up with Chinese ecommerce major JD.com to drive conversion traffic to the latter.
In 2017, Toutiao launched Fang Xing Gou, a short-lived ecommerce platform that operated within the Toutiao app.
In 2018, ByteDance tested the ecommerce waters with ZhiDian, an independent ecommerce app that sold high-quality consumer goods at affordable prices.
In 2019, ByteDance-owned Douyin introduced ecommerce mini-applications and made the product window feature available to all users.
In mid-December last year, Douyin Box, a Dewu-Xiaohongshu hybrid, was launched on Android and iOS. It allows users to shop, recommend, and search for products on Douyin.

Another sign that Dmonstudio was intended as just a brief experiment for ByteDance: Company insiders revealed that job offers were still being sent out under the company‚Äôs name even after it shut down, according to Jingzhe Research‚Äôs Bai Lu.
ByteDance is feeling its way across the ecommerce river, and Dmonstudio marks just another step that will help the Chinese tech behemoth define its ecommerce strategy.

Image credit: Carsome

2021 was a year of change for AirAsia and MyTukar, the Malaysian unit of Singaporean automotive marketplace Carro.
Covid-19 forced AirAsia to rethink its businesses amid pandemic-induced restrictions that crushed the aviation sector.
The budget carrier was then reborn as Capital A, a holding company with diversified interests, primarily in tech. It bolstered its super app but still kept a few fingers in the airline and logistics businesses.
Meanwhile, MyTukar underwent a reorganization and looked to grow its market share soon after sealing a US$30 million investment from Carro in 2019.
But, along with the change in name and strategic shifts, came major rejigging in the leadership of each company.
Tech in Asia has found that about 13 junior and senior executives from AirAsia‚Äôs marketing and tech divisions, as well as 12 junior and senior staff from MyTukar‚Äôs business development division, left to join Carsome in 2021.
While such corporate moves are commonplace, a former AirAsia employee with knowledge of the matter says the episode was unique as many who left the airline claimed to have been poached to beef up Carsome‚Äôs digital marketing and tech units.

The resignations have irked AirAsia co-founder and CEO Tony Fernandes, who in a February 3 LinkedIn post, took a swipe at his former colleagues, saying they ‚Äúhave never quite performed well in their new companies.‚Äù
While he did not explicitly mention Carsome, Fernandes also hit out at ‚Äúnew digital unicorns who actually have not achieved much‚Äù for poaching ex-AirAsia staff.
Carsome is said to be Malaysia‚Äôs first tech unicorn following its share-swap deal with internet investment firm Catcha in 2021.
‚ÄúIt takes a lot more than one person and that [is] the beauty and as people leave we replace them with better people,‚Äù Fernandes wrote in the post.
Capital A declined to comment on the staff departures and on Fernandes‚Äô LinkedIn post.
However, the CEO recently edited his post, clarifying that the statement didn‚Äôt ‚Äúapply to all‚Äù and that his point was that it had always been ‚Äúabout the team not the individual.‚Äù
Insiders familiar with the matter also tell Tech in Asia that they knew that Carsome had made offers to a number of MyTukar‚Äôs staff across different divisions.
Tech in Asia has seen offer letters dated June 2021 to select MyTukar employees from Carsome. Some of those named in those letters have jumped ship.
Carsome denied targeting talent ‚Äúfrom any company,‚Äù with a spokesperson telling Tech in Asia that ‚Äúthere is no attempt as alleged.‚Äù

734323,2022-02-24T05:00:41,Carousell triples revenue to $40.6m in 2020,"Simon Huang contributed to this story.
If all goes well, Carousell may sail through 2022 emerging as a US-listed company valued at US$1.5 billion.
Its recently released numbers for its financial year ending December 31, 2020 offer a glimpse into the firm‚Äôs performance in the lead-up to its debut on the public market, which might happen as soon as this quarter. Carousell declined to comment on rumors or speculations on its listing plans.

(From left) Carousell co-founders Quek Siu Rui, Marcus Tan, and Lucas Ngoo / Photo credit: Carousell

In 2020, the online classifieds giant reported a revenue of US$40.6 million, a more than 3x increase from 2019. Its acquisition of 701Search ‚Äì the Telenor-owned marketplace behind Mudah in Malaysia, Cho Tot in Vietnam, and OneKyat in Myanmar ‚Äì likely drove a bulk of that growth.
At the same time, Carousell‚Äôs losses before taxes deepened from US$42.2 million to US$63.9 million as its employee headcount ballooned. Economic uncertainty due to the Covid-19 pandemic also weighed on its performance in markets like Myanmar, leading to impairment losses.
That said, a large chunk of its losses are non-cash-based. Its net cash flow from operating activities actually improved by US$10 million to negative US$32.3 million.


Carousell acquired 701 Group in November 2019. If we consider the full impact of 701 Group‚Äôs full revenue for that year ‚Äì US$22.1 million ‚Äì Carousell would have reported a revenue of US$37.8 million in 2019 on a group level. On this basis, Carousell‚Äôs revenue grew by 7% between 2019 and 2020.

According to the classifieds giant, its performance varied from market to market, depending on how strict lockdowns were.
‚ÄúWe saw some markets grow rapidly with double and triple digit growth rates, while some markets were more impacted due to strict lockdowns that prevented businesses from operating,‚Äù a spokesperson tells Tech in Asia.
Growth by acquisition has its costs
Aside from 701 Group‚Äôs significant revenue contribution, Carousell is increasingly feeling the weight of running a sprawling business stretching across entities.
These include online automotive platform OneShift and sneaker marketplace Ox Street, which Carousell acquired in 2018 and 2021, respectively. There‚Äôs also Ox Luxe, a buying, selling, and consignment marketplace for pre-owned luxury goods, which spun out of the group at the end of last year.


Between 2019 and 2020, the firm‚Äôs employee benefits expenses roughly doubled to US$62.6 million. This was partly driven by a significant increase in non-cash share-based payments, which grew 8x to US$25.6 million. The firm also saw an increase in expenses on salaries, commissions, and bonuses, growing over 40% to US$32.4 million in the same period.
According to Carousell, the rise in share-based payments was due to a combination of a higher fair valuation of its employee stock option plan and ‚Äúrefresher grants‚Äù made to its team.
In 2020, a liquidity event ‚Äì the first of its kind for Carousell ‚Äì saw the firm‚Äôs employees cash out ‚Äúa few million dollars‚Äù as part of its ESOP buyback program, a company spokesperson told Tech in Asia previously. The group repurchased in cash over 230,000 share options worth US$12.04 each, amounting to US$2.8 million.

While acquisitions have been a quick way for Carousell to grow its top line, it also means rapidly increasing costs.
Carousell now has 800 employees across its various businesses, of which about 100 were added over the course of 2021 ‚Äì the year it acquired Ox Street. As such, employee benefits expenses are expected to continue rising in its 2021 financial year.

The firm will also see rising expenses as it charges ahead with its acquisition spree. Carousell is reportedly in talks with 99 Group in a deal that could bolster its own real estate offering.
Should the deal push through, 99 Group will add 350 employees to Carousell‚Äôs headcount, which come from the former‚Äôs property portals in Singapore and Indonesia as well as its data service providers Singapore Real Estate Exchange and Rumah123. The property startup has been reporting net losses prior to 2020 even as its revenue grew.
Asked if its rapidly rising headcount may indicate future redundancies, a Carousell spokesperson hints at upcoming plans around creating value for buyers and sellers who are ‚Äútime-starved and wary of transacting online.‚Äù
‚ÄúThese initiatives require investment in good talent, and in fact we are looking at growing our headcount,‚Äù the spokesperson says.
See also: Carousell in talks for $150m acquisition of 99 Group
This, however, does not eliminate the possibility that Carousell might make layoffs in some departments and hire in others in the future.
Analysts continue to keenly watch the classifieds giant‚Äôs traction in high-ticket categories like cars and property.
‚ÄúIn these categories, there are more professional sellers like property agents, developers and dealerships, who are willing to pay for the service,‚Äù Kristine Lau, an associate at global research firm Third Bridge, told The Business Times last September.
As of April last year, Carousell‚Äôs autos vertical accounted for a third of the Group‚Äôs revenue, which made it the largest contributor to its top line.
This continues to be the case. A spokesperson adds that the vertical is seeing ‚Äúrapid growth‚Äù in Singapore and Hong Kong, and that its auto brands have market-leading positions in Malaysia, Vietnam, and the Philippines.
However, not all of Carousell‚Äôs acquired marketplaces have performed to par.
In 2020, the company noted an impairment loss of US$7.8 million for the disposal of OneKyat, its classifieds marketplace in Myanmar, citing the ‚Äúoverall decline in the marketplace activities‚Äù and ‚Äúongoing economic uncertainty as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.‚Äù
A Carousell spokesperson says the firm remains committed to growing OneKyat and supporting its teammates on the ground in Myanmar, and that the impairment was ‚Äúa non-cash accounting adjustment that appropriately reflects the ongoing economic uncertainty‚Äù in the country.
More benefits to be realized
On the bright side, as a heavyweight in the secondhand goods space across Southeast Asia, Carousell stands to benefit from a trend toward ‚Äúrecommerce‚Äù ‚Äì or reverse commerce.
The revenue potential of the firm‚Äôs recent acquisitions have also not yet been reflected in its financial statements. Its acquisition of Ox Street, for instance, is likely to open up revenue streams from value-added services like authentication, refurbishing, shipping, and payments, in addition to fees that Carousell earns from promotion tools and business accounts.

Established in 2019 by Vincent Low, Kingsley Joseph, Henji Tan,¬†Carole Le Van¬†and Lijin Liang, Potato Play started as a publisher for HTML5 games. However, after realizing that their players had become accustomed to installing mobile apps, the company pivoted to mobile games.
Potato Play has produced several games such as Merge Rush Z, Sword Hunter, Merge Quest, and Pocket Racing, which have collectively accumulated 18.2 million downloads. It has also recently launched casual puzzle game Merge Restaurant.
The startup plans to use the fresh funds to make new hires and continue improving its games.

734197,2022-02-24T01:55:58,"In Indonesia, e-fulfillment rises as an ecommerce niche","For Indonesia‚Äôs major ecommerce marketplaces, one service that has become a fixture on their platforms is e-fulfillment. Tokopedia, Shopee, and Bukalapak all have this feature, which lets sellers hand over their warehousing and related services ‚Äì such as packing and shipping ‚Äì to the ecommerce platforms.
This is perhaps a natural development in Indonesia, where the geographical size and quality of infrastructure vary greatly between cities.
If Amazon is anything to go by, e-fulfillment holds plenty of promise: The US ecommerce giant‚Äôs Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) service counts 85% of the firm‚Äôs top 10,000 global sellers as users, and it has also powered Amazon‚Äôs marketplace revenues over the years.
That said, several rising startups are also eyeing this space, offering a third-party, platform-agnostic option for ecommerce sellers. While many of these startups are already ecommerce enablers or logistics players, some are entering the space from seemingly unrelated industries.

Still, e-fulfillment is not necessarily the easiest space to enter. The warehousing part of the equation, for instance, is particularly capital-intensive. Meanwhile, margins are thin.
‚ÄúProfitability may be difficult if you run it as a standalone business,‚Äù says a logistics CEO who declined to be named in this report.
A road to scale
Broadly speaking, e-fulfillment providers offer warehousing services in the form of the warehouse space and workers needed. Tokopedia‚Äôs fulfillment platform TokoCabang, for instance, takes care of everything from storing inventory all the way to packing orders and shipping them to customers via last-mile partners.
What‚Äôs even more attractive, however, may be location: Most players have a network of warehouses spread across the country, including lower-tier cities. Riady Kurniawan, founder of direct-to-consumer makeup brand Goban Cosmetics, says that leveraging e-fulfillment would easily let ecommerce sellers like him expand into other areas without incurring too much costs.

Fulfillment models in Indonesia / Photo credit: Rizqi Maulana

While online marketplaces are perhaps the pioneers in this space ‚Äì Tokopedia launched its e-fulfillment service in 2019, with Shopee and Bukalapak following suit a year later ‚Äì there appears to be room for third-party players. Like many others, Indonesian ecommerce sellers often do business on several marketplaces.
‚ÄúThe majority of marketplace warehousing fulfillment services are exclusive only to sellers on their platform,‚Äù says Budi Handoko, the co-founder and CEO of logistics firm Shipper. ‚ÄúThis is where we can become a non-biased service provider.‚Äù
Marketplaces also typically have additional requirements that sellers must meet ‚Äì like a special membership or a minimum daily transaction amount ‚Äì before they can use the platform‚Äôs fulfillment services. Third-party players are usually more flexible.

For the likes of Shipper, e-fulfillment is a logical evolution of its existing strategy. The Y Combinator alum, which raised US$63 million last year in a series B round led by DST Global and Sequoia India, started as an aggregator for logistics services.
Another player, East Ventures-backed Sirclo, started as a software-as-a-service platform that helps MSMEs create Shopify-like online storefronts. It now offers e-fulfillment services through its ecommerce enabler business, Sirclo Commerce, which was launched in 2017.
But this space has also attracted those who previously had little to do with ecommerce or logistics. Kioson, a startup that lets individuals and small businesses sell digital products like phone credits, announced a plan in November 2021 to operate more than 100 new warehouses in East Java through a subsidiary called Gudang Pintar (which means ‚Äúsmart warehouse‚Äù).

Image credit: Timmy Loen

Indeed, the anonymous logistics CEO we cited earlier says that even with large volumes, e-fulfillment margins are ‚Äúvery thin.‚Äù It is thus more sustainable if a company offers a wider array of services rather than e-fulfillment on its own.
‚ÄúFulfillment tends to be the cost center for ecommerce platforms or even retailers themselves,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúLast-mile logistics players or ecommerce enablers would have the best positions here since they can subsidize the costs from their other business lines.‚Äù
Otherwise, he adds, any extra fees will ultimately have to be shouldered by the usual suspects: the customers themselves.
Deep pockets needed
A large part behind the thin margins of e-fulfillment businesses is the relatively sizable setup costs. The founder of an e-fulfillment firm who declined to be named says that he had to shell out at least 9 billion rupiah (US$628,300) to start operating a warehouse unit in the Greater Jakarta area.
The amount covered the cost of renting a large 5,000-square-meter warehouse in a strategic area near Jakarta, with a rental fee of 3 billion rupiah (US$209,414) per year. The remaining capital was used for operations, including payment for a warehouse management system software license, as well as fees for electricity, security, staff, and other requirements.
‚ÄúWith such a large amount of capital, fulfillment players need to calculate a cost-to-serve approach in every warehouse they own so that operations are truly efficient. The goal should at least be that the entire business can accommodate tens of thousands of orders per day [from various warehouses],‚Äù the founder explains.

To pursue such a target, several players have expanded their warehouses to different areas, even reaching several cities outside the Java island. They either build the warehouses on their own or partner with startups and big property players.
For instance, Shipper ‚Äì which claims to have managed more than 300 warehouses as of November 2021 ‚Äì partnered with Metrolink, one of Indonesia‚Äôs largest warehouse facilities. Other e-fulfillment services, such as those run by Shopee and Lazada, also rent Metrolink warehouses.
According to a 2018 report, the contract value for the construction of one Metrolink warehousing facility is 1 trillion rupiah (US$69 million).
Meanwhile, smaller warehouses from other players can go for 1.2 billion rupiah (US$83,803) a year to US$4.5 billion rupiah (US$314,339) a year for a 6,000-square-meter space.
For Kurniawan, the founder of Goban Cosmetics, the current pricing is relatively expensive, but he says at least Indonesian sellers still have an array of options.
Amazon, on the other hand, has been so dominant in several countries that FBA has been criticized for alleged antitrust violations.
To be clear, FBA is not mandatory for Amazon sellers, but signing up for the service would make it easier to get Prime status (along with the visibility and sales that come with it). Other sellers, some say, sign up for FBA even if it ends up being more expensive than shipping the products themselves.
The allegations against the ecommerce titan have led to a US$1.3 billion fine in Italy, as well as investigations in the European Union and India. Amazon, however, maintained that sellers wouldn‚Äôt use FBA if it didn‚Äôt provide value.

734226,2022-02-23T12:47:38,Exclusive: Oyo-like healthcare startup eyes up to $20m series B money,"Ayu Health, an India-based healthcare startup, is in talks to raise US$15 million to US$20 million in a series B round by the end of March, co-founder and CEO Himesh Joshi¬†told Tech in Asia.

An Ayu Health hospital / Photo credit: Ayu Health

The startup will use the funding to expand its hospital network in the states of Punjab and Haryana while continuing to develop its technology to serve hospitals and patients across all facets of healthcare.
In September 2021, the company raised US$6.3 million in a series A round from Singapore-based Vertex Ventures and Stellaris Venture Partners. The round also saw participation from some angel investors.
Founded in 2019 by Joshi, Arijit Gupta, and Karan Gupta, the startup is building an Oyo-like model for hospitals in India.
The trio had earlier established Zefo, an online marketplace that specializes in selling refurbished TVs, mobile phones, and furniture. In April 2019, they sold the firm to Quikr in a US$26.7 million all-stock deal.
Building the Oyo of hospitals
After the Zefo acquisition deal was wrapped up, Karan decided to go back to his hometown and help his parents ‚Äì both doctors ‚Äì to scale their 100-bed hospital in Panchkula, a town in the Indian state of Haryana. The hospital was not giving the returns that Karan‚Äôs family expected.
After discussing the matter with his fellow Zefo founders, they soon realized the white space in the healthcare market. ‚ÄúWhile technology and the internet have fundamentally transformed commerce, entertainment, and education in the past 10 years, the experience of going to a hospital largely remains the same,‚Äù says Joshi. The biggest intervention has happened around doctor consultations, he added.
With these insights, they decided to look deeper into the hospital sector. While India has more than 69,000 hospitals, they noted there are just around 10 branded hospital chains such as Apollo, Manipal Health, and Fortis.

Ayu Health co-founders (from left) Karan Gupta, Himesh Joshi and Arijit Gupta / Photo credit: Ayu Health

The co-founders realized that several of the standalone hospitals have good infrastructure and protocols in place as well as trained staff. However, they couldn‚Äôt differentiate themselves from others or create their own brand, so most of these hospitals run only at 30% to 40% utilization, noted Joshi.
These findings led to the birth of Ayu Health in October 2019. Once a hospital comes under the Ayu network, the startup uses digital channels to market them, creates a centralized operating system for the hospitals‚Äô use, and digitizes the processing of health insurance.
For a more transparent offering, Ayu Health also¬† formulates standardized price packages for several procedures, irrespective of the number of days or number of consultations a patient has to take. Doctors take care of the clinical part of the procedure, while Ayu Health accounts for the operation side.
More hospitals to join the network
Ayu Health has 40 hospitals in its network, mostly located in the cities of Chandigarh and Bengaluru. The startup is in expansion mode and will be entering cities like Delhi-NCR, Hyderabad, and Chennai in 2022. It plans to grow the number of hospitals in its network by 10x by the end of the year, Joshi told Tech in Asia.
Earlier this month, it acquired SwasthyaSewak Network Of Hospitals in Jaipur, which will bring 16 more hospitals into Ayu Health‚Äôs network.

The company also places an Ayu Mitra ‚Äì a counselor who speaks to patients and navigates their overall experience ‚Äì in every hospital under its banner. ‚ÄúThis is the only human intervention that we have at the hospital level. Everything else is digital,‚Äù said Joshi. There are currently 60 Ayu Mitras across the network, with 50 to 60 more to be hired this year.
Ayu Health also plans to partner with diagnostic centers so that hospitals that don‚Äôt have such services won‚Äôt lose out on patients.
Since the company uses an asset-light model and is not involved in building the hospitals, the team hopes that Ayu Health can become the largest network of branded hospitals in India.",Samreen Ahmad,Collin Furtado and Lorenzo Kyle Subido,0,"['Investments', 'Premium Content', 'Startups']",True,True,3

Hello reader,
When listicles titled ‚Äú11 sinking cities around the world‚Äù or ‚Äú5 cities that will be drowned‚Äù start popping up more frequently on social media and news portals, something isn‚Äôt right. The world is sinking, and our maps are likely to be redrawn by global warming in the not-so-distant future. This is an unavoidable reality that puts millions of lives at risk.
The usual suspects of rapid urbanization, rising sea levels, and land subsidence have all contributed to this climate crisis. It has already left a marked impact on one of the largest Southeast Asian markets: Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia and home to more than 10 million people, has the unfortunate label of ‚Äúthe fastest sinking city in the world.‚Äù
Almost half of Jakarta sits below sea level, and some researchers believe that if the capital‚Äôs issues related to rising sea levels continue to go unchecked, parts of the city will be entirely submerged by 2050. Jakarta‚Äôs problem is so dire that the Indonesian government passed a bill to move its capital from Jakarta to East Kalimantan on Borneo island.
The unprecedented move is one of the first capital relocations to be driven by environmental forces and it is unlikely to be the last, as Tokyo, Ho Chi Minh City and Bangkok all stare at a similar threat.
Startups and governments are taking note of this problem and are now scampering to find viable solutions. In our premium story pick today, we analyze the feasibility, potential, and challenges that face a startup pitching floating houses and infrastructure as the answer to a global conundrum.

‚ÄúWhy not just build on top of the water?‚Äù Shiwen Yap, co-founder of FlexBase International, told Tech in Asia. This is FlexBase‚Äôs straightforward solution to the complex question of how to save the world‚Äôs coastal cities.
The Netherlands-based firm is bringing its expertise in constructing floating buildings to Southeast Asia. The company told Tech in Asia that it will start its expansion into the region by investing US$1 million to set up its international office in Singapore and plans to hire for five key functions locally. For now, FlexBase will focus on Thailand and Vietnam.


Floating clean energy: In Southeast Asia, the firm will focus on entering the hospitality, agriculture, aquaculture, and energy spaces. Besides building floating hotels and farms, its system can carry solar panels and turbines. The global market for floating power plants alone is expected to breach US$2.4 billion by 2028.


Cultural hurdles: FlexBase has previously built floating houses in Bangladesh and the Philippines ‚Äì two flood-prone countries. However, its houses are not seeing much demand in those areas. ‚ÄúLiving on water is socially unacceptable, and in general, people are afraid of water and therefore don‚Äôt feel safe. We see these issues in the whole ASEAN region,‚Äù says FlexBase founder Jan Willem Roel.


Work in progress: In Singapore, FlexBase is preparing to build two floating projects, which it says will involve private as well as public groups. These initiatives include a 50,000 square meter sports facility and a food court complex. The company is also partnering with the National University of Singapore to build a study location on a floating vertical farm concept.

Worldwide demand: Facilio currently has more than 40 clients across India, the Middle East, the US, Europe, the UK, Singapore, Australia, and Brazil. These customers are large enterprises that own at least 5 million square feet of real estate. Co-founder Prabhu Ramachandran said that Brookfield, which also participated in the funding round, is one of its clients.


Beating pandemic blues: There was a brief lull when the Covid-19 global health crisis broke out, but Ramachandran said business has since picked up. While he didn‚Äôt disclose the company‚Äôs financials, he said the firm clocked a 4x year-over-year revenue growth in 2021. He expects the firm will continue this growth in 2022 as well. ‚ÄúWe should be able to break even sometime next year,‚Äù he added.


Fresh funds, new targets: Ramachandran told Tech in Asia that Facilio wants to tap into the smart building software-as-a-service market, which is projected to hit US$265.4 billion by 2028. Facilio plans to use the fresh capital to expand its local teams ‚Äì especially in verticals such as sales, pre-sales, and customer support ‚Äì and aims to increase its headcount from 125 to 200 people by the end of 2022.

733631,2022-02-23T08:00:11,The value of cross-border payments for Asia‚Äôs fintech firms,"When Covid-19 hit the globe, three things happened: consumer behaviors evolved, trade increased with emerging markets, and digitalization was supercharged. The payments industry was quick to step up to respond to consumer challenges, which led to the increased acceptance of digital payment platforms today.
‚ÄúAs many struggled economically, faster settlement times, customer-fee waivers, and short-term funding support was offered by financial institutions to lighten consumers‚Äô economic load,‚Äù recalls Rohit Narang, managing director for Asia Pacific of cross-border payments platform Currencycloud. ‚ÄúPlayers in the space also rolled out educational resources and initiatives to help users cope with the newfound disruption.‚Äù
Governments similarly offered support by waiving or reducing certain payment charges, increasing digital transaction limits, and providing funds to support the digital transformation of SMEs. Amid the pandemic, the use of contactless payments across emerging Asia has increased by 60% ‚Äì double the initial estimate. By 2023, Asia‚Äôs payments sector is expected to exceed US$1 trillion in annual revenue.

However, gaps still remain in Asia‚Äôs payment ecosystem. While domestic payment options are strong, international transfers need improving.
International payments fall short in Asia
With existing cross-border payment options, consumers experience a lack of transparency, delays in payment processing, inconsistent service availability, and convoluted regulations, according to Narang.
Payment systems across the world have differing standards, systems, and regulations. These differences have caused bumps in the process, preventing seamless data exchange between customers, providers, and their stakeholders.
‚ÄúIf multiple intermediaries are involved, cross-border payments can take up to three days to process, and even longer for less-developed markets,‚Äù says Narang.
Bank penetration in emerging Asian countries also remains low. Over half of Asia‚Äôs population is unbanked while 18% are underbanked, and many don‚Äôt have access to cross-border payments at all. As banks abandon corridors, customers are left with a smaller ‚Äì and more expensive ‚Äì pool of options to send or receive money overseas.
Cross-border payments also face the issue of limited coverage.
‚ÄúDespite SWIFT boasting connectivity to more than 200 markets, this doesn‚Äôt guarantee banks‚Äô blanket connectivity as a bank‚Äôs coverage is dependent on the size of their own correspondent banking network,‚Äù explains Narang. He is referring to the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications, the most popular global messaging system used by banks and financial institutions to manage cross-border transactions.
To address these gaps, consumers have taken to carrying physical cash. However, one can only carry so much cash into each country, and it comes with several security issues.
Wire transfers, done through regulated institutions such as banks or remittance companies, are a reliable option. However, these also lack transparency and can be expensive.
This leaves consumers with unregulated, informal brokerage networks.
‚ÄúThe danger of using these brokerage networks is that costs may be high, and since operations are typically based on trust, the risk of losing the money still stands,‚Äù points out Narang, ‚ÄúThere is also no transparency in where the money is when moving across borders and how long it may take to reach the recipient.‚Äù
Keeping up with cross-border payments
The pandemic accelerated payment trends that were already in motion. In particular, Southeast Asia saw a rise in investments in the e-payments space. Contactless payment methods such as QR codes and digital wallets are also now commonplace ‚Äì in Singapore, for instance, meals at hawker centers can be paid for using such options.

Agreements such as the ASEAN Cross-Border Payments Interoperability Network initiative were launched to encourage member countries to draw up bilateral arrangements for real-time payments across Southeast Asia. These agreements not only influence digital payment adoption and financial inclusion, but also open up opportunities for fintech businesses in the region.
For one, they allow intra-Asia flows, which can improve the overall efficiency and interoperability of cross-border digital payment systems. Further innovation, partnerships, and collaboration between payment providers and businesses are also made easier.
‚ÄúDigital acceptance and transformation from industries such as logistics and healthcare are making these sectors appear modern and desirable to young job seekers,‚Äù says Narang, ‚ÄúThis ultimately impacts the economy and increases prospects for payment providers and the greater industry.‚Äù
For businesses looking to dabble into the payments space, there are a couple of hurdles they must anticipate. For one, navigating the regulatory landscape can be challenging as each region maintains different infrastructures and network interoperability.
Amid these constantly evolving regulations and requirements, the importance of a secure and efficient payment process is evident. The Currencycloud Spark solution aims to automate this process, securing payment instructions from the get-go to avoid returns, delays, and extra costs. This allows users to access a multi-currency wallet that supports 38 currencies.
Additionally, Currencycloud‚Äôs SWIFT global payment innovation lets businesses track where their money is throughout the transfer process.
The future of international money transfer
This year, global cross-border payments are expected to reach US$156 trillion. According to Currencycloud, it‚Äôs likely that further integration of digital payments across the value chain will occur.
Through partnerships, players in the industry will ensure value-added services for customers. Bilateral real-time payment arrangements are also set to create regional payments infrastructure that will connect the payment systems of different markets.

‚ÄúIt is an exciting time for cross-border payments,‚Äù says Narang, ‚ÄúBusinesses should embrace digital transformation, understand deeply what needs to be done, and be prepared to invest in setting up the right systems and human resources to create the platforms that provide value to customers.‚Äù
Using APIs and partnering with third-party payment providers can help businesses remove the complexity of figuring it out themselves, allowing them to easily scale and expand their offerings to a larger global audience.
With all the digital payment developments in the pipeline, Asia can look forward to a new and improved payments ecosystem soon.

Currencycloud gives banks,businesses, and fintech companies everywhere the capability to move money across borders and transact globally in multiple currencies, fast. The firm makes it easy for clients to embrace digital wallets and embed finance into the core of their businesses, no matter the industry, enabling them to scale and expand globally.

733944,2022-02-23T07:00:11,A P2P edition: a troubled Capital Match and Funding Societies‚Äô Vietnam push,"Welcome to The Top Up! Delivered every Wednesday via email and through the Tech in Asia website, this free newsletter breaks down the biggest stories and trends in fintech. If you‚Äôre not a subscriber, get access by registering here.
Hello there,
In the fragmented online lending market, one firm‚Äôs downfall is another‚Äôs gain.
This week, we investigated investor allegations against Capital Match, a Singapore-based P2P firm that specializes in invoice financing.
The P2P lending sector is no stranger to controversy, and Capital Match isn‚Äôt the first firm to go south. It also definitely won‚Äôt be the last.
In recent times, you‚Äôd recall CoAssets‚Äô fall from grace, a story Tech in Asia broke in December 2020. And just last week, we covered the plight of Indonesia-based UangTeman‚Äôs investors and their futile efforts to claw back their money since early 2021.
P2P firms ‚Äì at least in their most traditional sense ‚Äì aren‚Äôt set up to be aligned with the investors they represent and the deals they enable. Unlike balance sheet lenders, many P2P firms do not have skin in the game ‚Äì they purely provide a platform for lenders to connect with borrowers.
When loans go bad, it‚Äôs the lenders who risk losing their capital, while P2P firms risk losing only interest on repayments. There‚Äôs also limited incentive for platforms to take an active role in loan recovery and maintain the credit quality of the assets they‚Äôre taking on.
That said, to players serious about the long haul, having a good reputation matters. That means delivering on projected investment returns and keeping non-performing and default rates to a minimum, without compromising on credit quality even as loan books grow.
But not all is bad. Several online lending platforms are going from strength to strength even as they emerge from what‚Äôs hopefully the worst of the pandemic.
We examine one of them ‚Äì Funding Societies and its US$144 million-backed push into Vietnam ‚Äì in this week‚Äôs Hot Take.

THE BIG STORYAnother P2P lender goes south: millions on the line for Capital Match‚Äôs investors

Investors charge that years of poor oversight and irresponsible lending have compounded into a costly mistake for Capital Match.

THE HOT TAKEFunding Societies‚Äô new heavyweight investor

Funding Societies co-founder and director Kelvin Teo / Photo credit: Funding Societies

Here‚Äôs what happened:

Last week, Funding Societies raised US$144 million in a series C+ round.
The round was led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2 and joined by VNG Corporation and Rapyd Ventures, among others.
The firm also received US$150 million in debt financing from institutional lenders from Europe, Asia, and the US.

Here‚Äôs our take:
Until now, Funding Societies‚Äô main market has been Indonesia, where it operates as Modalku.
The Singapore-headquartered firm, which also operates in Thailand, Malaysia, and Vietnam, targets MSMEs. It offers various lending products such as invoice financing, term loans, and supply chain financing, and the values of these loans can range from US$500 to as much as US$1.5 million.
Its most recent funding round, however, signals its ambitions in Vietnam, whose internet economy is expected to see a compound annual growth rate of 29% to US$57 billion between 2021 to 2025 ‚Äì a rate of growth outstripping even Indonesia‚Äôs ‚Äì according to a report by Temasek and Bain &amp; Co.
Most notably, Funding Societies may have pulled a coup with a prominent backer in VNG Corporation, the Vietnam-based gaming and entertainment unicorn that also owns social media platform Zalo, online media platform Zing News, digital payments app ZaloPay, and cloud services solutions provider VNG Cloud.
Without discussing specifics, Funding Societies CEO Kelvin Teo told Reuters last week that it plans to use its financing business to launch its ‚Äúnew businesses.‚Äù
VNG might offer some indication as to what those plans might be. Ryan Galloway, Funding Societies‚Äô country director in Vietnam, has said that Zalo messenger and ZaloPay wallet could create ‚Äúendless possibilities‚Äù for the fintech firm‚Äôs borrowers.
In Vietnam, Zalo‚Äôs 52 million monthly active users place it even ahead of WhatsApp. As Funding Societies forges ahead with its neobanking ambitions in the country, Zalo‚Äôs ‚Äúinnate data value and network‚Äù opens up a huge opportunity.
Since being flagged by regulators in 2021, Zalo does not provide loans to customers, though it refers them to third-party financial providers through its platform Fiza (short for Finance Zalo).
Funding Societies could potentially tap Zalo‚Äôs data on users ‚Äì as well as merchants ‚Äì to roll out microfinancing products for them. This will lower the lending platform‚Äôs customer acquisition costs.
That said, Funding Societies is not yet licensed in Vietnam, though a company spokesperson tells Tech in Asia that it is working with the country‚Äôs regulators. The spokesperson adds that customized or proprietary offerings will be rolled out as soon as ‚Äúthis or next year.‚Äù
Together, both Funding Societies and VNG Group can create a ‚Äúseamless customer experience‚Äù across lending, payments, spend management, and other services for SMEs, the spokesperson adds.
With Funding Societies‚Äô loan origination back on track after a tough start to the pandemic as well as a firm hold on default rates, which it has maintained at 1% to 2% for the ‚Äúpast few years,‚Äù Vietnam could hold the key to unlocking the lending platform‚Äôs next stage of growth.
That said, Funding Societies is not the only SME lending platform setting its sights on Vietnam, or the only one pulling in partners with strong networks.
In January, Singapore-headquartered Validus‚Äô local unit, Validus Vietnam, formed a joint venture with VC firm Do Ventures and conglomerate TTC Group. Together, they aim to support SMEs in Vietnam through various financial inclusion initiatives.

733669,2022-02-23T02:00:24,Why should Southeast Asian startups consider expanding to Melbourne?,"The city of Melbourne, located in Australia‚Äôs state of Victoria, is a multifaceted place. It‚Äôs an international city and a hub of art, history, and culture ‚Äì as well as a rising startup ecosystem in Asia Pacific.
According to Startup Genome, the city came in 36th in its 2021 list of global startup ecosystems, and it saw US$529 million in early-stage funding that year. Melbourne‚Äôs startup ecosystem also grew in value to roughly US$7.6 billion in 2021.

The city is home to several Australian unicorns such as Afterpay, Airwallex, and Judo Bank. Melbourne also has a culture of entrepreneurship, a huge talent pool, and an open economic environment that‚Äôs giving startups the opportunity to thrive.
‚ÄúMelbourne is still a relatively young ecosystem compared to other places in the world,‚Äù says Judy Anderson, the former CEO of Startup Victoria, a nonprofit grassroots founder community in Melbourne. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a huge amount of energy in the city.‚Äù
It‚Äôs also proving to be a promising destination for Southeast Asian startups that are looking to expand beyond Asia, thanks to the opportunities and support that the state of Victoria can give.
What Melbourne has to offer
Underpinning the appeal that Melbourne holds for businesses in Southeast Asia are the strong ties between Australia and the region. The Australian government sees Southeast Asia as a key partner for trade and development. It has also enacted several policies to help drive investments into the country, including incentives to encourage research and development activities.
The state government of Victoria, in particular, offers more specific support for businesses entering Melbourne. Invest Victoria, the state‚Äôs investment attraction agency, provides services such as grants and cash flow loans to new startups in the city.
Melbourne is also home to many accelerators and incubators, which range from sector-agnostic organizations to dedicated, industry-specific programs.
Aside from its resources for startups, the city has other key features that make it appealing to founders looking to expand their businesses.
In Anderson‚Äôs view, Melbourne is teeming with talent, especially on the engineering and tech fronts.

Judy Anderson, former CEO of Startup Victoria / Photo credit: Invest Victoria

‚ÄúMelbourne is famous for having some of the best engineering and developer talent in the world,‚Äù she explains. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre looking for senior developers, the quality is insane, and in terms of the more junior tech talent, we‚Äôve got a lot of newly-trained tech and engineering talent coming out of the universities here, which are among the top universities in Australia for tech and engineering.‚Äù
Another key element of Melbourne‚Äôs appeal is the city‚Äôs connectedness. According to Anderson, the city‚Äôs startup community is tightly-knit, which means that new founders can easily find the resources, information, or introductions they need for their businesses. Startup Victoria, which is also one of Australia‚Äôs largest networks for entrepreneurs, runs community networking and outreach programs that help founders connect with prospective investors, partners, and employees.
While there are plenty of benefits, resources, and support available in metropolitan Melbourne, the broader region of Victoria presents more opportunities for startups to tap into. Victoria is home to over 6.6 million people spread out across both urban and rural territories, and there are a few key verticals that Anderson says are seeing more activity in the region.
‚ÄúMelbourne is a wonderful city if you‚Äôre in health and medtech. We have great research facilities and institutions that we have set up here, at the University of Melbourne and Monash University,‚Äù she shares. ‚ÄúAnd if you‚Äôre working in agriculture or future foods, Victoria is a great place to be because we‚Äôve got a really strong industry network in place.‚Äù
Navigating the ecosystem
Melbourne holds a lot of potential for Southeast Asian businesses, but the city‚Äôs startup scene is considered relatively young, which means that there isn‚Äôt as much support available for later-stage companies compared to other ecosystems.
Also, while the city is teeming with talent, getting people on board is not easy, as Southeast Asian businesses ‚Äúwill be competing with local startups for that talent,‚Äù says Anderson.
‚ÄúSo depending on the networking, connections, and relationship skills, connecting with the right talent could either be really difficult or perhaps a little bit easier,‚Äù she adds.
However, Melbourne has several initiatives in place to help make the journey a little easier for businesses entering the city. For instance, founders can turn to the city‚Äôs highly-connected startup scene for support. Invest Victoria runs an Advisory Network program where companies can connect with potential partners, and it also offers services that support businesses in setting up operations in Melbourne.
From Southeast Asia to Melbourne
It was the support of Invest Victoria that helped ease the entry of Singapore-based caregiving startup Homage into Melbourne in 2021.
Founded in 2017, Homage offers a suite of home and nursing care services, and it has over 3,000 care professionals in its network. In an interview with Invest Victoria, Homage co-founder and CEO Gillian Tee shared that the firm saw ‚Äúa sufficient breadth and depth of need in Australia‚Äù for its services. She cited the larger demand across Asia Pacific for care services, which is seeing a fast-growing ageing population, rising chronic disease incidence rates, and an ongoing shortage of caregivers.

However, making the shift into Melbourne took a lot of effort for Homage, as the company needed to navigate the different administrative and logistical demands of entering a new market. This ranged from building up a local team to adapting its workflows and operations so that it aligned with the regulations of the Australian government.
In the interview, Tee shared that Invest Victoria helped connect Homage to the relevant recruitment platforms, agencies, and office space providers to support the firm‚Äôs initial hiring and business setup process. The organization also helped Homage in facilitating visa applications for team members coming in from outside Australia.
Invest Victoria also introduced Homage to partners in Melbourne, such as carer and nurse training institutions as well as State Government representatives of Victoria, so that the firm could explore new partnerships and expand its local pool of trained and qualified care providers to support its services.
This helped smoothen Homage‚Äôs entry into Australia and ensured that the firm had a comfortable landing pad when it began operations in the new market.
Another Southeast Asian company that has decided to set up in Melbourne is Indonesian ecommerce major Bukalapak. The firm has chosen Melbourne as its first international base and has established a research and development center in the city. It aims to tap into Victoria‚Äôs pool of tech talent and explore partnership opportunities to further its goal of transforming lives through technology.
‚ÄúMelbourne‚Äôs tech ecosystem is an ideal base for Bukalapak to establish this tech hub, which enables Indonesia‚Äôs tech talent to work together with tech professionals from Australia and around the world,‚Äù said Teddy Oetomo, president of Bukalapak, in an interview with Invest Victoria.
Growing and going further
The Victorian government is committed to enabling the growth of new ventures in the region and has launched new initiatives to support this. One of these initiatives is the Breakthrough Victoria Fund, which will drive investments in areas such as health and life sciences, agri-food, advanced manufacturing, clean energy, and digital technologies.
The government is also working to attract more capital into Victoria‚Äôs startup ecosystem, having invested US$59.8 million into the Victorian Startup Capital Fund, which aims to grow the region‚Äôs venture capital sector and drive investments into early-stage firms.
Additionally, Invest Victoria has established offices in key markets in Southeast Asia such as Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam. These offices facilitate a startup‚Äôs entry into Victoria by providing tailored assistance to help founders on their journeys to international expansion.

733814,2022-02-23T01:55:11,Another P2P lender goes south: millions on the line for Capital Match‚Äôs investors,"In 2016, many investors in Singapore were piling their funds into peer-to-peer lending schemes at a time when China was clamping down on them hard.
One particular P2P firm in Singapore was growing fast. Running on VC fuel, Capital Match would go on to finance more than S$150 million (US$111 million) to SMEs in Singapore and Hong Kong by 2019.
But that growth may have come at the expense of its investors.
No, this isn‚Äôt a story about clueless investors getting their fingers burnt.

Two investors, who each put ‚Äúsix figures‚Äù in US dollars into Capital Match between 2016 and 2019, are outraged by the allegedly inaccurate or false information provided to them, which they say misled them into investing.
They aren‚Äôt just aggrieved because of their potential losses, which they accept is part and parcel of investing. Instead, they say that years of poor notification processes, irresponsible lending, and a lack of prompt recovery efforts on Capital Match‚Äôs part have compounded into a costly mistake for the platform‚Äôs many investors.
Both investors spoke to Tech in Asia on condition of anonymity.
On personal finance site Seedly, Capital Match has a 2.3 rating out of 5, with an investor cautioning others to ‚Äúavoid this platform‚Äù in one review. Other platforms like Bridge and Funding Societies had ratings of 4.5 and 4.1, respectively, ranked on metrics like portfolio transparency, customer support, and user experience.
Capital Match‚Äôs business, meanwhile, appears to have significantly declined from its heyday, its filings show.
In an emailed statement to Tech in Asia, the company said it ‚Äústrongly disagrees with any allegation of false or misleading information having been provided to investors on the platform.‚Äù It was unable to comment on its position on specific allegations, which are the subjects of ongoing court proceedings.
P2P lending platforms are no strangers to controversy. In 2020, hundreds of investors on Singapore-based CoAssets saw their holdings evaporate as the firm shut down amid a growing mountain of troubled debt.

That said, some like Funding Societies and Validus are going from strength to strength. Last week, Funding Societies raised US$294 million in funding from investors including Softbank Vision Fund 2 and VNG Group. Validus, in the meantime, is charting an expansion into Vietnam through a joint venture launched in January.
As for Capital Match, it is waging a costly lawsuit in the Singapore High Court against Sanmina-SCI Systems, a subsidiary of electronics manufacturer Sanmina Corporation ‚Äì a Fortune500 company ‚Äì for S$10.4 million (US$7.7 million) in repayments on invoices that Capital Match says are owed to it.
According to Capital Match, the ‚Äúapproximately S$10 million (US$7.4 million) in outstanding principal‚Äù in facilities on its platform comprises ‚Äúless than 5%‚Äù of the US$163.5 million that the firm has disbursed to SMEs since 2015.
But that‚Äôs also just a fraction of payments outstanding as Capital Match has multiple debtors, including shipbuilding firm Keppel Fels, electronics manufacturer Flextronics, and Japanese textile manufacturer Toyobo.
The outstanding sum likely impacts hundreds of investors, but not all losses are final: Tech in Asia understands that the trial is expected to reconvene in March, with judgment expected later this year.
Payments that never came
Established in 2014, Capital Match links investors to SMEs in need of upfront cash. It began offering invoice financing facilities in 2019.
The firm is not licensed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). According to the regulator, whether a platform facilitating invoice factoring is required to hold a Capital Markets Services license ‚Äúwould depend on its business model, including the activities conducted, and the characteristics and terms of the transactions offered on the platform.‚Äù
Capital Match enters into factoring agreements with SMEs, whereby it buys invoices issued by the SME and disburses upfront cash to the borrower using investor funds. In turn, the debtor repays the amount set out in the invoice directly to Capital Match.
In Sanmina‚Äôs case, it allegedly didn‚Äôt pay a bulk of its obligations.

The US$7.7 million in question represents payments on over 2,800 invoices that were issued by Jeams Transportation &amp; Warehousing ‚Äì an SME borrower on Capital Match‚Äôs platform ‚Äì to Sanmina for services rendered between 2016 and 2019.
In theory, arrangements like the one Capital Match has with Jeams are low-risk investments.
Assuming invoices are properly verified, the investor takes on the credit risk of the debtor ‚Äì often an established blue chip company ‚Äì instead of the SME‚Äôs, says Louis (not his real name), who has invested in hundreds of facilities on Capital Match since 2016.
Pierre (not his real name), an investor who has put money in several other P2P lending platforms, says he was drawn to Capital Match‚Äôs ‚Äúsemi-secured loans.‚Äù He began using the platform in 2016 and has invested in ‚Äúwell over a thousand‚Äù facilities since.
It worked out for a while. Then, Pierre noticed many delayed payments on his facilities tied to Sanmina in 2019, some ‚Äúlong overdue.‚Äù He approached the P2P lender for answers.
Capital Match already had this information but they were not sharing it with me.
A Capital Match employee let slip that ‚Äúa seller had died,‚Äù which might have been a reason for the delayed payments. Pierre says he found the reason suspicious: Even if the seller had passed away, Capital Match should have had the right to these invoices.
Unable to get much out of Capital Match, Pierre began investigating. Through a lawyer, he found out that Jagit Singh, Jeams‚Äô principal, had died in August 2019.
Up till that point, Pierre did not know ‚Äåthe identity of the firm he had lent to, as Capital Match anonymizes the borrowers on its platform. Jumping through those hoops, however, was unnecessary, Pierre says. ‚ÄúCapital Match already had this information but they were not sharing it with me,‚Äù he adds.
Later, Pierre was ‚Äúshocked‚Äù and ‚Äúdisappointed‚Äù to find out that the firm involved ‚Äì Sanmina ‚Äì had allegedly not been notified in the way that Capital Match had explained to him.
He had invested in notified facilities, in which the debtor ‚Äì or the company that‚Äôs being billed the invoices ‚Äì is informed about the factoring agreement between the lending platform and the SME borrower. The notification ensures that the debtor pays the lending platform when it‚Äôs time. It also gives the lending platform direct recourse to the debtor in events of late or non-payment. (In contrast, in unnotified facilities, debtors aren‚Äôt notified of these arrangements, and lending firms have to claw back payments from the SMEs.)
Tech in Asia has viewed court documents submitted to the Singapore High Court by lawyers representing Capital Match and Sanmina.
Sanmina-SCI Systems denies owing Capital Match US$7.7 million ‚Äì or any other sum ‚Äì in outstanding payments. It also denies receiving a Notice of Assignment (NOA) informing it of any factoring agreements between Capital Match and Jeams in 2016.
Court documents reveal that the NOA, sent by Singh to Sanmina via email, had never reached Sanmina‚Äôs finance team, which it was addressed to, but was instead received by a ‚Äúsenior logistics supervisor.‚Äù It had supposedly also never been signed.
Despite that, between 2016 and 2019, Sanmina‚Äôs finance team had paid out some S$4.1 million (US$3 million) to a Capital Match bank account that had been designated for Jeams‚Äô debt. This, however, was just a fraction of the total bill.
On Capital Match‚Äôs part, it says that summary lists of invoices, which were signed off by Sanmina‚Äôs employees, had served as a basis for entering into new factoring agreements with Jeams.
However, around July 2019, the lending firm found that some of the invoices were fictitious.
‚ÄúAll is well‚Äù
Capital Match continued disbursing cash to SMEs despite having trouble collecting money from debtors.
In June 2018, Capital Match disbursed S$66,000 (US$49,000) to Jeams and was trying to raise a further S$136,000 (US$101,000) for the SME despite being owed S$4.7 million (US$3.5 million) in outstanding payments from Sanmina, a WhatsApp conversation admitted into court evidence shows.
In the same WhatsApp conversation, Singh revealed to a Capital Match employee that he was ‚Äúdesperate‚Äù to pay out salaries to employees, which had already been delayed.
Eight months later, in February 2019, Capital Match continued to enter into new factoring agreements with Jeams even as the debt from Samina hit ‚Äúabout S$5.6 million‚Äù (US$4.2 million), with some invoices delayed by ‚Äúclose to a year,‚Äù a transcript of an audio recording submitted to court evidence shows.
Capital Match says allegations made against it relating to these facilities are ‚Äúfalse.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt is a firm policy and a part of our SOP (standard operating procedure) that we do not disburse any additional funds to SMEs where we are not satisfied with their creditworthiness, or where there are outstanding payments,‚Äù a Capital Match spokesperson says.
Another problem was that in parallel, Capital Match had been writing to investors to assure them that everything was well.
In an update to investors dated June 7, 2019 and seen by Tech in Asia, Capital Match wrote that Jeams was ‚Äúgrowing strongly,‚Äù and that it had facilitated financing of Jeams‚Äô invoices to Sanmina for ‚Äúmore than two years now and there has been no default on any of the invoices.‚Äù
That wasn‚Äôt all.
WhatsApp screenshots between Singh and Capital Match‚Äôs commercial director revealed that Singh had borrowed money from the platform via two different entities ‚Äì ‚ÄúJeams T&amp;T‚Äù and ‚ÄúJeams T&amp;W.‚Äù The former likely refers to Jeans Transport &amp; Trading, a separate entity that Singh also oversaw.
Because the identities of the SMEs were anonymized, investors did not know that they were doubly exposed to the same person ‚Äì Singh ‚Äì because both entities would have been listed under a different serial number on the platform.
‚ÄúIn conversations I‚Äôve had with Capital Match, they haven‚Äôt been willing to acknowledge that their conduct has effectively led to this,‚Äù says Pierre.
Lack of information?
Online lenders do keep borrower identities a secret for a good reason: SME borrowers prefer to be discreet in case its customers, suppliers, competitors, or employees are also investors on the platform.
A Capital Match spokesperson explains that it does so to prevent other parties from contacting borrowers on its platform to offer them additional financing, which might in turn increase the credit risks of its borrowers.
‚ÄúInvestors are provided information on relevant details on the SMEs and any guarantors in accordance with our SOP, with such information being sufficient to identify any connection between related SMEs on the platform,‚Äù the spokesperson adds.

On another major lending platform, borrower identities can be shared with its investors but strictly after getting a request, its CEO tells Tech in Asia.
With such a practice, a big drawback for investors is that they can‚Äôt conduct their own due diligence or verify the information shared by the platform.
In Capital Match‚Äôs case, this information is typically collated on a ‚Äúrequest sheet‚Äù that details the total loan quantum sought, expected payment date, monthly interest rate, as well as the identity of the debtor. It also includes financial statements ‚Äì albeit unaudited ‚Äì in the preceding years and various methods of recourse the debtor has in the event of defaults.
Tech in Asia looked through over a dozen of these ‚Äúrequest sheets‚Äù that laid out investment terms for notified securities backed by Keppel Fels, Sanmina, Flextronics, and Toyobo.
An estimated S$1.2 million (US$890,000) in defaults have occurred on facilities linked to Flextronics and another S$2 million (US$1.5 million) on those linked to Toyobo, based on one investor‚Äôs back-of-the-hand calculations, though the outstanding sums are possibly more.
Capital Match also began legal action against sellers and their guarantors in a Toyobo-linked facility in March 2020. Legal proceedings are ongoing.
Investors on the platform are still owed funds from facilities linked to Keppel Fels that date back to 2016, after Capital Match told investors in December that year that it found ‚Äúissues with some invoices involving inconsistencies internally at Keppel.‚Äù It also stopped offering invoices issued to Keppel on the platform at the end of November 2016.
That‚Äôs despite several of these facilities being personally guaranteed by the borrower‚Äôs directors, who owned a freehold terrace valued at S$2.8 million (US$2.1 million), request sheets dated in 2016 show.
In September 2017, investors were told that the freehold terrace, which was in the process of liquidation, was valued at ‚ÄúUS$2.9m+ with an outstanding mortgage of around US$2.2m.‚Äù There was no mention of any outstanding mortgage prior to this, Louis says. Effectively, the dollar value of the personal guarantee had shrunk by about a third.
In response to a letter of demand that Louis sent in April 2021, Capital Match said that the property owners had not been forthcoming with those details. ‚ÄúWe are not responsible for any representations made by parties in the facilities, nor are we responsible for the adequacy, accuracy and/or completeness of any information supplied by parties to the facilities entered into,‚Äù it wrote.
Further, request sheets stated that the facilities would be backed by a trade credit insurance that was ‚Äúin process‚Äù and would ‚Äúrequire a few weeks to get finalized.‚Äù This would protect Capital Match ‚Äì and its investors ‚Äì against defaulted payments.
However, Louis says he found out in 2021 that the trade insurance policy never materialized. When quizzed, Capital Match said that there had been no representation that the insurance policies were guaranteed, but the firm also didn‚Äôt update investors about the policy‚Äôs status.
Sporadic updates
Louis says that over the years, he has had to chase Capital Match dozens of times for updates, but responses from the firm were sporadic and vague.
On one Keppel Fels-linked facility that was in arrears, Louis recounts receiving his first update only 82 days after its stipulated payment date in September 2016. He was never updated when it was first delayed, or even when it was 30 days late, but ‚Äúonly when it was almost in technical default,‚Äù Louis says.
Then, in June 2020, Louis noticed that the multiple facilities relating to Keppel Fels were suddenly marked as ‚Äúbad debt.‚Äù Upon clarification, a representative for the firm explained that recovery efforts were still underway.
Capital Match tells Tech in Asia that its updates can be sent ‚Äúanytime between 60 to 90 days‚Äù past payment due dates and that delays beyond its control, such as from court proceedings, can lead to updates only being provided when there are significant developments. It adds that a majority of its investors are satisfied with the timeliness of its updates.
Both investors say they have put in requests to review and inspect documents relating to their facilities, but were declined.
In response to these allegations, Capital Match says that all investors who make a request to review and inspect documents relating to financial transactions at its offices can do so.
It has, however, rejected some requests in 2020 because its offices were closed due to the pandemic. It has also rejected requests that were related to facilities that were the subject of proceedings before the Singapore Courts. The firm adds that it had provided these reasons to relevant investors at the material time.
MAS guidelines on securities-based crowdfunding operators do not ‚Äã‚Äãspell out if, and how soon, investors have to be informed in the event of a default. That said, Capital Match is not licensed by the MAS.
On another major lending platform, investors get updates on delinquent accounts ‚Äúafter the grace period of seven days past due,‚Äù after which they are updated regularly on its platform about its collection efforts, its CEO tells Tech in Asia.
Enter Sesami
It‚Äôs unclear why Capital Match continued to extend millions of dollars of financing to Jeams despite the accumulation of alleged unpaid invoices by Sanmina.


Capital Match‚Äôs aggressive lending to Jeams could have been aimed at bolstering its loan books in the lead-up to a merger with Sesami, a Singapore-headquartered procurement firm, in November 2018.
Sesami was a profitable software company serving large corporate customers like Singapore Airlines and the National Healthcare Group that spent millions on procurement from SME suppliers. A merger would give Capital Match an immediate pipeline of new clients while turning Sesami into a tech company overnight.
In theory, the merged entity would be larger than the sum of its parts: It was expected to see combined revenues of ‚Äúmore than S$20 million‚Äù (more than US$14.9 million) and be profitable on an EBITDA basis.
But the benefits of the merger didn‚Äôt appear to have been realized on either end. Official filings show that since 2019, Capital Match‚Äôs assets and revenues have taken a dive. Its accumulated losses also increased by almost fivefold between 2019 and 2021.
Sesami‚Äôs revenue, meanwhile, was only US$3.6 million in 2021.


A former employee says that disagreements in direction and leadership styles between Pawel Kuznicki, Capital Match‚Äôs Polish founder and former CEO, and Teck Soon Ong, Sesami‚Äôs CEO, hampered that vision. Both of them served as co-CEOs of the new entity. A ‚Äúbig cultural gap‚Äù also existed between Sesami, which was run by ‚Äúmuch older guys,‚Äù and the young, dynamic team at Capital Match.
In July 2019, Kuznicki stepped down from his leadership post without giving a reason.
Things appeared to go downhill after his departure. ‚ÄúThe company was built in [Kuznicki‚Äôs] image and when he left, it was very difficult for the company to carry on,‚Äù the ex-employee says.
A source close to the company tells Tech in Asia that the company lacked the depth of experience in the financial sector to manage the risks that came with its growing loan book. Sesami executives also did not have the experience to run a fintech firm.
Tech in Asia was unable to reach Kuznicki for comment on this story.
Investor safeguards
Capital Match continues to solicit new investors to its platform.

Source: Capital Match‚Äôs website accessed in January 2022

A page on the Capital Match website displayed its rates of return on investments, as well as non-performing loan rates for 2020 when Tech in Asia accessed the platform in January.
The page has since been removed.

Capital Match‚Äôs performance for 2020 as per figures published on its site. The firm has since removed all statistics on its website. / Source: Capital Match‚Äôs website assessed in January 2022

Unpublished figures from 2016 to 2017 that were obtained from the site‚Äôs source code show that the quality of credit on the platform has deteriorated some years after 2016.


Capital Match says it cannot confirm that these figures were shared on the platform in the past.
A spokesperson from the firm adds that less than 0.23% of its invoice financing facilities in 2020 and 2021 have gone beyond 60 days past due, and that the average return on its platform in the past two years was ‚Äúapproximately 11% per annum‚Äù on the funds deployed.
According to Louis, the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) is currently investigating Capital Match for operating without the proper licenses. Tech in Asia reached out to the CAD to obtain an update on the case, but it declined to comment.
Tech in Asia also understands that a lawsuit against Capital Match was brought to the High Court at the end of last year on the grounds that it had misled investors. The lawsuit has since been withdrawn.
Louis, who has approached the MAS for assistance, says he was told that as an unlicensed entity, Capital Match does not fall under its purview. ‚ÄúAs an investor, you should really think twice when you do investments in Singapore because in practice, there‚Äôs hardly any recourse,‚Äù Louis says.
In a statement to Tech in Asia, an MAS spokesperson says: ‚ÄúMAS strongly encourages investors to deal only with entities regulated by MAS, so that they will be protected by the laws administered by MAS. By dealing with unregulated persons or entities (including those based overseas), investors will forgo the protection given under the MAS regulations.‚Äù
Louis admits that it was an oversight on his part to invest through an unlicensed platform, which he had not been aware of at the time, and that he would have ‚Äúbeen more careful‚Äù had he known.
He‚Äôs now close to exhausting his options.
The cost of pursuing legal action can be prohibitive for individual investors in Singapore. Louis says that he has been advised that a lawsuit could cost him ‚Äúbetween S$200,000 to S$600,000 in court fees‚Äù (between US$149,000 to US$446,000), making little sense for an investor to file one unless they‚Äôre owed well more than that.
Though rare in Singapore, minority stakeholders have come together to take representative action. While banding together does not necessarily increase the chances of a better outcome, one upside is that hefty legal costs can be split.
That said, representative action in Singapore requires all members of the class to be identified and agreed upon before litigation commences, which could pose a challenge.
While Louis still hopes to recover a partial sum of his capital, he isn‚Äôt hopeful. ‚ÄúRealistically, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs going to happen, but I do hope to protect future investors,‚Äù Louis says. ‚ÄúHundreds if not thousands of investors who are affected who have families who worked for that money.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe are on track to double those numbers this year,‚Äù Fazz Financial CEO Hendra Kwik told Tech in Asia.

Fazz Financial is the new entity that emerged after Singapore-based Xfers and Payfazz ‚Äì which Kwik co-founded ‚Äì joined forces last year. Both companies are graduates of Y Combinator, the US-based startup accelerator. Kwik now serves as group CEO of Fazz Financial, while Xfers co-founder Tianwei Liu is the deputy CEO.
Since 2016, Payfazz and Xfers have collectively raised more than US$74.1 million in funding from prominent investors such as Tiger Global and DST Partners. Fazz Financial currently serves more than 150,000 businesses and has around 600 employees.
Building a financial super app
After Payfazz poured US$30 million investment into Xfers last year, the companies decided to integrate their products and come up with a combined offering.
Payfazz usually only serves SMEs, but it can now cater to startups and big enterprises, thanks to Xfers‚Äô API solution. On the other hand, Xfers can also provide Payfazz-developed solutions in Singapore.
The ‚Äúmarriage‚Äù seems to be a fruitful one in terms of processed transactions. Payfazz, which initially only operated in Indonesia, now gets almost half of its gross merchandise value (GMV) from its Singapore business, according to Kwik.
StraitsX, an Xfers service that focuses on digital assets, registered US$1.5 billion in transactions from January to October 2021.

Fazz Financial currently has four business models: payments enabler, cash storing, credit solution, and financial tools (which includes HR management and bookkeeping). The company generates revenue from commissions or subscription fees.
While payment solutions are still its bread and butter, Fazz Financial said that growth from credit solutions and financial tool subscriptions also looks promising.
Today, its service is still fragmented into different apps. For example, users need to download the Payfazz app for bills payment, Payfazz Buku for bookkeeping services, and Modal Rakyat to apply for loans.
Fazz Financial plans to combine all of those services into one app in the near future.
‚ÄúThe strategy moving forward is to build a financial super app that can serve every business, from a small one-man shop to big enterprises,‚Äù CFO Karl Hu told Tech in Asia.
Fazz Financial did not offer any details about the name of the potential super app. However, it will still use the financial licenses it owns ‚Äì ranging from e-money and payment acceptance to money transfer, lending, and other banking functions ‚Äì through its subsidiaries.
The company likens its planned super app with solutions offered by US-based Brex, Denmark‚Äôs Pleo, and Paris-headquartered Qonto.
Continue to reinvest profits
Kwik says that Payfazz had become profitable last year, prior to Xfers deal. However, the company decided to reinvest the money to chase further growth, especially in the enterprise market.
If Fazz Financial successfully raises the series C round, it will use the funds to hire more engineers and build more products.
The company‚Äôs primary targets are still Indonesia and Singapore. However, Kwik isn‚Äôt shy about his ambition to enter other markets in Southeast Asia in the future, following the path of super app Grab.

However, YGG‚Äôs SLP earnings dropped 69% in December 2021 compared to the previous month. It also saw a roughly 12% reduction in the total number of SLPs farmed.
One reason for this slide was the 19% jump in the price of SLP tokens after Sky Mavis issued a fresh update for Axie Infinity.
YGG‚Äôs report further noted that its scholars had farmed almost 132 million SLP tokens in total as of December 2021. While SLP farming fell that month, the company saw it soar in November, marking a nearly 123% surge compared to October.

The value of YGG‚Äôs assets on its other top games increased as well. The guild‚Äôs assets on Star Atlas, Monkey League, and Illuvium¬†hit US$10 million, US$8.2 million, and US$6.6 million, respectively.
YGG also added more games in Q4 2021, including Thetan Arena, Aavegotchi, Genopets, VulcanVerse, and Nitro League.
Since its launch in November 2020, YGG has partnered with as many as 48 projects and has invested US$9.7 million in these tie-ups to date. Of that amount, nearly 76% was spent on play-to-earn games, 17.4% on gaming guilds, and 6.4% on what YGG describes as play-to-earn infrastructure games.
‚ÄúWe will continue to grow and forge new partnerships to expand the reach of YGG as we help the play-to-earn market mature. This is an essential phase to ensure our long-term vision for equitable opportunities in the metaverse is realized,‚Äù the guild‚Äôs founders said in a statement.

In Q4 2021, the company formed 27 new partnerships, which cost about US$5.5 million. Of this, about 54.7% went to play-to-earn games, 27.4% was for gaming guilds to expand the reach of YGG, and 17.8% was targeted at platforms and infrastructure that would support the wider play-to-earn ecosystem.
The above-mentioned amount also includes US$2.9 million towards game partnerships. Of this, almost 58% was invested in acquiring non-fungible assets that YGG players need to get started with a game. The remaining 43% was focused on the governance tokens for the games.
YGG‚Äôs member base on Discord has increased from 480 in November 2020 to nearly 100,000 by the end of 2021. The company highlighted that it has seen an average of 21% month-on-month growth after reaching the 50,000 mark in August 2021.

733786,2022-02-22T05:00:13,Dutch startup plans to keep Southeast Asia afloat ‚Äì literally,"The Netherlands has a problem: Almost a third of its land is under sea level, and the country continues to sink by around one-third of an inch per year.
That‚Äôs why the Dutch nation turned to floating houses and infrastructure as a solution.

But the issue doesn‚Äôt stop in the Netherlands ‚Äì climate change is causing sea levels to rise all over the world. Southeast Asia is among the most vulnerable to these changes and is already witnessing more floods every year. By 2030, the estimated cost of damages due to rising sea levels in urban areas such as Bangkok, Jakarta, Manila, Taipei, Seoul, Tokyo, and Hong Kong is pegged at US$724 billion.
This has caught the attention of FlexBase, a Dutch-based climate change-focused firm that has entered Southeast Asia with its expertise in constructing floating buildings.
The company tells Tech in Asia that it will start its expansion by investing US$1 million to set up its international office in Singapore and plans to hire for five key functions: operations, business development, sales and marketing, and engineering. For now, it says it will focus on the Thailand and Vietnam markets.
‚ÄúOne of the things that makes Southeast Asia so interesting is the fact that the population growth is enormous. So that requires a lot of land, not only to live on but also to grow food,‚Äù says Shiwen Yap, co-founder of FlexBase International.

FlexBase founder Jan Willem Roel / Photo credit: FlexBase

Founded in 2013 by engineer Jan Willem Roel, FlexBase builds floating structures based on a hybrid polystyrene-concrete model called the FlexBase Concept System. The hybrid material allows the firm to develop large relatively affordable floating structures at scale and minimizes the use of concrete and steel, which FlexBase claims reduces the carbon footprint of such structures. It is also significantly less expensive and lighter than marine-grade steels.
In Southeast Asia, the firm wants to enhance urban resilience along coastal cities by promoting floating structures as a practical approach.
‚ÄúThe long-term solution would be rather than you try to reclaim the land, fill it in, and then often sink ‚Äì why not just build on top of the water?‚Äù says Yap.
Living on water
The concept of floating houses is not new: Coastal communities in Cambodia and the Philippines, for example, feature boats fitted with dwelling spaces or houses built on stilts. ‚ÄúFloatels,‚Äù or floating hotels, are present across Southeast Asia as well.
There is also a Dutch firm, Finch Floating Homes, which uses recycled plastic barrels as the foundation of its structures. It has already built a pilot home in the Philippines.

FlexBase‚Äôs idea of floating structures, on the other hand, uses expanded polystyrene, a type of foam that can withstand loads while staying afloat. The material can also be recycled if needed and is protected with polyurea ‚Äì a coating agent used to protect structures against the elements ‚Äì which lowers maintenance costs in the process. This system, the company says, makes its structures unsinkable.
‚ÄúWhen you look at the total cost of ownership, the total lifecycle cost over steel, or in construction versus one with our system, I think we‚Äôre looking at much better returns overall and also much less carbon emitted,‚Äù Yap says.
FlexBase founder Roel also dispels concerns about the material‚Äôs potential harm to the environment, stressing its recyclability and longevity. ‚ÄúI can guarantee it can float for 50 years,‚Äù he shares.
However, there is the issue of market-readiness, as homeowners typically prefer to build on solid ground.
FlexBase previously completed floating houses in Bangladesh and the Philippines, two flood-prone countries that have high exposure and vulnerability to natural hazards, according to a World Risk Report. However, the company says its houses are not seeing much demand in these areas.
‚ÄúLiving on water is socially unacceptable, and in general, people are afraid of water and therefore don‚Äôt feel safe. We see these issues in the whole ASEAN region,‚Äù says Roel.
Besides this challenge, there is the issue of cost. Roel says that to build something on water will be 50% more expensive than constructing something on land. While land prices can be steep in general, the pricing of an area of water varies, so it is also difficult to give a price per square meter for floating structures due to numerous factors.
‚ÄúI want to know, how deep is the water? How big are the waves? Is there a lot of water current? What is the location?‚Äù says Roel.
The company‚Äôs Bangladesh project, for example, cost 200 euros (US$226) per square meter, over 3x cheaper than the average price of US$712 per square meter for an apartment in the outskirts of Dhaka‚Äôs city center.
But while the structure‚Äôs foundation is cheaper ‚Äúby 25% to 40%‚Äù compared to steel, building on water piles on costs for additional features like entrances and bridges.
These setbacks have pushed FlexBase to target businesses in the region instead.

The firm‚Äôs focus in Southeast Asia will be to enter the hospitality, agriculture, aquaculture, and energy spaces. Besides building floating hotels and farms, its system can also carry solar panels and turbines, which addresses food security and employment concerns, says Yap.
The global market for floating power plants alone is expected to breach US$2.4 billion by 2028. Meanwhile, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has earmarked US$100 billion of funding for climate financing between 2019 and 2030.
‚ÄúIn Asia alone, if 5% of these [ADB] funds are spent on novel solutions like floating construction, that‚Äôs a US$5 billion market over this decade,‚Äù shares Yap.
The company says that for its target businesses in sinking regions of Southeast Asia, the benefit of future-proofing structures by making them float is worth the investment.
Regulations that float across the SEA
Scaling floating infrastructures in Southeast Asia is not that easy. While the Netherlands has regulations in place for floating structures, Asian countries don‚Äôt. There is also another conflict: The type of construction sits between conventional building codes and maritime vessel standards, so countries in the region must make new rules in this context.

This is one reason FlexBase went to Singapore. According to Roel and Yap, it‚Äôs a country known for stringent regulatory practices, and operating in the city-state could help define the rules for floating structures in Asia.
‚ÄúOnce that is established, and with the rules that come with it, then we can use those as precedents for other countries to build,‚Äù says Yap.
FlexBase is currently preparing to build two floating projects in Singapore, which it says will involve private as well as public groups. These initiatives include a 50,000 square meter sports facility and a food court complex. The company is also partnering with the National University of Singapore to build a study location on a floating vertical farm concept.
With concerns on sea level rise and other disasters having gone unanswered at the recent COP26 climate change conference, countries whose cities will sink in a few decades must find ways to keep lives and properties afloat.
FlexBase‚Äôs entry into Singapore could build new construction standards for the region and offer an alternative for countries that want to ride the rising tide.

The transaction is pending customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.

Founded by Jody Ong and Hiro Kiga in 2016, Wallex Technologies helps businesses in Indonesia, Singapore, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Macau to make cross-border payments into more than 180 countries. It also enables these businesses to collect payments from customers in other countries via virtual accounts and hold funds in a digital wallet.
In a statement, Wallex Technologies said that it currently supports almost 2,000 banking and tech clients, processing almost S$4 billion (around US$3 billion) in annual gross transaction value (GTV). After the M-Daq acquisition, the combined entity is expected to process S$15 billion (around US$11 billion) in GTV this year.
According to M-Daq, Wallex Technologies will continue to run independently with Kiga as the new appointed CEO, replacing Ong. On top of the undisclosed acquisition fee, the fintech firm will also invest fresh working capital into Wallex Technologies.

M-Daq aims to integrate Wallex Technologies with its foreign exchange solution Aladdin. The platform has processed nearly S$30 billion (around US$22.2 billion) in cross-border transactions since 2016. It counts prominent Chinese ecommerce firms such as AliExpress, Tmall, and JD.com as its clients.
In August last year, M-Daq raised US$200 million in a series D round from Asian private equity giant Affinity Equity Partners. The startup also counts EDBI, NTT Communications, and Samsung as its investors.
Earlier this month, M-Daq led the US$1.4 million round of digital wallet platform HolyWally.
In 2020, M-Daq‚Äôs revenue declined by 65% to US$20.5 million. The company also swung to a negative EBIT of US$4.3 million in the same year from a US$2.4 million profit in 2019, according to VentureCap Insights data.

Founded in 2021 by former Lazada and Flipkart executive Ankit Malhotra, the Heyy app gives users access to self-assessments, bite-sized and research-backed resources on mental well-being called Lifebuoys, as well as trained psychologists and experts for intensive therapy needs.
The app also connects users with Helpers, a ground network of trained individuals who provide mental health first aid 24/7. These Helpers engage with aid-seekers as many times as required before recommending expert guidance.
‚ÄúOur Helpers create an anonymous, confidential, and safe space for users to open up and talk about their deeply personal issues. This has helped thousands reach out and seek help already,‚Äù said Malhotra.
The founder shared with Tech in Asia that there was a time in his career when nothing seemed to be working out. The professional phase had a direct impact on his personal life as well.
‚ÄúLooking back, it was perhaps these years that shaped my understanding or need to have accessible support systems in organizations for employees. If I had Heyy then, I would have had a guide who could have helped,‚Äù he said.
The startup provides both B2B and B2C services. It has a renewal rate of 100% and 40% in the enterprise and consumer segments, respectively. According to the startup, between 10% and 14% of employees start using the app in the first month after being introduced in their workplaces, which is much higher than the 1% to 2% adoption seen for traditional wellness programs offered by companies.
While the first target market for Heyy is India, the company also sees a big opportunity in Southeast Asia. The startup‚Äôs clients include Sheroes, Wobot.ai, and GoDesi in India, as well as Brick and R-Fitness in Southeast Asia.

Atem Network CEO Leo Li / Photo credit: Atem Network

Nearly 80% of the funding will be used in building a multichain Web3 social platform, while the rest will be invested in marketing to attract users.
Building blockchain communities
On the Atem platform, group spaces can be initiated using tokens and NFTs (non-fungible tokens), allowing users to chat, trade, and govern. This will create a community exclusively for crypto and NFT owners.
‚ÄúWe will scan the user‚Äôs wallet and, based on that information, we will know what tokens or NFTs the user holds,‚Äù Leo Li, CEO of Atem Network, told Tech in Asia. Then the platform will automatically put users in group spaces based on mutual tokens or NFTs that they own.
All spaces and channels on Atem will be under the governance of a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization).
This means users co-decide the rules of the communities. Data is stored in a decentralized way with end-to-end encryption, which guarantees complete anonymity and allows users to be in control of their data, identity, and governance, according to the company.
Solution for a Web3 social infrastructure
The company is aiming for a beta release of its chat product in mid-March, and it will be offering its first 5,000 limited edition NFT passports to the crypto and NFT communities. Anyone who holds the passport will get first-hand experience on the Atem platform and additional future rewards.
The team is also currently working on a ‚Äúuser portrait‚Äù feature based on on-chain data, which will serve different decentralized app developers and work to recommend group spaces and channels on Atem.
‚ÄúWe will also work on multichain development in the future,‚Äù Li said.
In the long-term, the company wants to become the go-to solution for the social infrastructure of Web3.
The TikTok link
The company was co-founded in November 2021 by Li and COO¬†Eric Chan.
While Li was a product manager at TikTok and a venture capitalist at INCE Capital before he became an entrepreneur, Chan has worked at companies such as Bybit, Meta, TikTok, JPMorgan, and HSBC.

Hello reader,
When I was younger, I had a huge piggy bank that was so full that it could no longer rattle. It even had a slit at the back for bigger notes to fit.
I was saving up to buy a set of Roald Dahl books, but my dreams were smashed when I discovered that my brother had secretly broken the piggy bank. Although we were only children, it broke my heart.
Today, a bunch of individual investors who put their savings into embattled Indonesian lender UangTeman are unsure whether they‚Äôll get their money back from the company.
UangTeman, which is currently winding down its operations, is no stranger to tough times, but it‚Äôs bracing for even tougher times ahead.
We‚Äôll have to wait and see if ‚Äåthe company can solve its financial woes and do justice to its investors, who once believed in its potential.
Today we look at:

Whether UangTeman can return investors their money

An Indian social commerce unicorn that is looking to expand into Southeast Asia
Other newsy highlights such as Animoca‚Äôs latest gaming acquisition and Coinbase‚Äôs plans to expand into Asia Pacific.


Premium summary
Where‚Äôs my money?

UangTeman is now up against a group of individual investors, who have waited for months for the returns of their investments.
These investors, whose funds became the loans that UangTeman provided to borrowers, add to a slew of troubles the company has faced over the past year. Thus far, the company has failed to ‚Äåpay outstanding salaries to its former employees, among other internal issues.
The group of 11 investors who poured 9 billion rupiah (nearly US$628,000) to be disbursed as UangTeman loans told Tech in Asia that they stopped receiving payments of any kind by March 2021.


Unpaid promises: One of the company‚Äôs investors told Tech in Asia that he has been trying to cash out his investments since March 2021. But like UangTeman employees, he was repeatedly told that he would be repaid once the startup receives a cash injection or gets acquired. By that point, he and other investors had stopped receiving their interest income as well.


Plan of action: UangTeman is said to have told the investors that it planned to pivot from consumptive loans to productive ones (i.e., loans for entrepreneurs and businesses, instead of payday cash loans that the startup had mostly disbursed). However, it‚Äôs unclear whether that plan materialized ‚Äì previous reports have said that by April 2020, the company had stopped disbursing loans.


Overwhelming principles: Investors have also raised concerns about claiming insurance on their investments, which supposedly covers up to 85% of the principal amount. But it is likely the insurance only covers events where borrowers fail to repay their loan ‚Äì not UangTeman‚Äôs deteriorating health as a company.

New year, newer markets:  DealShare founder and CEO Vineet Rao told Tech in Asia that the company is preparing to expand its footprint overseas. It plans to start with markets in the Gulf Cooperation Council and eventually enter Southeast Asia as well.


Ticking the profitability box ‚òëÔ∏è: The social commerce firm aims to break even in India by the end of the year and is currently identifying key areas of investment that will help drive the company to operational profitability.

Delivered every Monday via email and through the Tech in Asia website, this free newsletter breaks down the biggest stories and latest trends on Asia‚Äôs publicly-listed tech companies. If you‚Äôre not a subscriber, get access by registering here.
Hello reader,
A whirlwind, a hurricane, or an earthquake? Whatever it was, a Free Fire-ban-sized calamity sent Sea Group‚Äôs (SE, NYSE) share price on an almighty plunge, with the tech behemoth enduring its biggest one-day fall last week. Its shares are currently trading a little over 60% below its 52-week high of US$372.70.
The Singapore-based firm shed US$16 billion in market value ‚Äì a roughly 18% drop ‚Äì after India banned Free Fire, the best-selling game of Sea‚Äôs digital entertainment unit Garena. The Indian government considers the title a threat to national security. This led to a spate of downgrades or price target cuts by analysts and Sea‚Äôs shares ended the week down around 20%.
The ban on Free Fire has certainly shaken Sea‚Äôs investors, with fears growing over whether the ban could be extended to include another of its pillars in Shopee.
In our premium story analyzing Shopee‚Äôs odds in India, my colleague Samreen notes that the ecommerce platform has made a strong start in the country but faces strong competition from the likes of Amazon, Flipkart, Meesho, and Snapdeal.

A bright spot ‚Äåin the life of Forrest Li, Sea‚Äôs chairman and CEO, went largely unnoticed amid the chaos of his company‚Äôs share price. Shareholders approved changes last week that further entrenched Li‚Äôs control over Sea, giving him 57% of total voting power.
However, Sea has no time to relax ‚Äì this premium story breaks down Garena‚Äôs slowing growth, Shopee‚Äôs revitalized competitors in its Southeast Asian markets, and the dangers of expanding at breakneck speeds.
Many questions remain up in the air. Will Sea sail through the Garena slowdown? How much will India‚Äôs ban on Free Fire impact Sea‚Äôs top and bottom lines? Perhaps investors will be treated to a few definite answers when Sea releases its Q4 2021 earnings report on March 1.

üá∏üá¨ Grab (GRAB, NDAQ): The super app has lost more than half its market value since it debuted in public markets in December. However, Temasek seems to have sensed a buying opportunity. Singapore‚Äôs state-owned investment firm disclosed a stake in Grab via securities filings.
üáÆüá≥ Reliance Industries Limited (RELIANCE, NSE): The conglomerate‚Äôs telecommunications arm, Reliance Jio, lost nearly 13 million wireless subscribers in December 2021. This follows another sharp drop three months prior, when the firm lost around 19 million subscribers. Jio was the worst hit of India‚Äôs telecom operators in a broader nationwide slump in total wireless subscribers due to recent tariff hikes. In other news, Jio was the sole investor in the funding round of this Singapore-headquartered unicorn.
üá∫üá∏ Amazon (AMZN, NDAQ): The ecommerce titan brought an end to its long-standing tussle with Visa (V, NYSE) over payment fees that threatened to dent the financial giant‚Äôs business and disrupt ecommerce payments. Amazon will no longer charge an extra fee for customers who use Visa cards on its platform in Singapore and Australia.
üá®üá≥ Tencent (0700, HKG): Already dealing with China‚Äôs big tech crackdown, the gaming and social media giant is also struggling to find friends on the other side of the world. Ecommerce sites operated by Tencent were included on the US government‚Äôs latest ‚Äúnotorious markets‚Äù list. While inclusion on the list is a blow to Tencent‚Äôs reputation, it carries no direct penalties.

1Ô∏è‚É£ To err on the side of caution: Share markets are falling. Bond markets are falling. Geopolitical tensions and inflation are rising. There is nowhere to hide for investors and this sentiment has rippled through India‚Äôs IPO market. Prominent tech startups such as hospitality firm Oyo and logistics provider Delhivery have taken notice and are now hitting the brakes on their public debuts.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Pink slips: A prime target of China‚Äôs tech clampdown, DiDi Global (DIDI, NYSE) has lost more than 70% in market value since its listing last June ‚Äì one of the biggest IPOs for a Chinese company listed on an American exchange. The ride-hailing firm is now going for a massive layoff across all departments. While 20% of overall staff will be let go, the headcount for each of DiDi‚Äôs operations and business departments will be reduced by 20% as well.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Reading between the lines: Recently listed tech firms in India are feeling the strain of the broader market route. Shares of Zomato (ZOMATO, NSE), Paytm (PAYTM, NSE), and Nykaa (NYKAA, NSE) hit all-time lows last week. In a nod to the current market conditions, PharmEasy may readjust the valuation it was aiming for through a public offering. The online pharmacy‚Äôs shares are currently being traded in the gray market at a significantly lower price compared to last year.

Founded in 2018, BuzzAR helps retail and commerce firms create personalized and location-based AR experiences for their customers. On top of that, it also acquired a mobile game called The Cooking Game VR.
The company was established by Bell Beh, who previously worked at Singtel and Marina Bay Sands, and Ken Lim, who has more than 10 years of experience as an engineer in the deeptech industry.
When the metaverse trend came, BuzzAR realized that it had developed some of its enablers, such as augmented and virtual reality technology, games, and avatar engines. Thus, it planned to capitalize on the trend by launching NFTs and social network features in 2022.
With the fresh funding, the startup aims to hire more employees and set up an office in the US. It also plans to launch an avatar NFT platform called CryptoToon in the coming weeks.

733557,2022-02-21T05:00:35,The key players in Indonesia‚Äôs SaaS industry,"
Indonesia‚Äôs SMEs, which numbered 65 million in 2021, are thriving ‚Äì and so are the software-as-a-service players that cater to them.
Indonesia‚Äôs SaaS market will grow from US$200 million in 2020 to over US$1 billion by 2025, research firm RedSeer estimates. Indeed, funding has caught up too: In 2021, SaaS companies collectively raised US$400 million ‚Äì a record.

SaaS is an umbrella term for a variety of solutions such as point of sales, human resource information systems, management software, and web hosting plus ecommerce.
Based on an analysis of funding rounds, SaaS firms serving the retail sector have banked the most cash to date (around US$272 million), powered by the likes of MSME bookkeeping apps BukuWarung and Lummo. Those serving the POS sector come next, including firms like Gojek-backed Moka. Management software is in third place in terms of funding, with firms such as e-logistics platform Waresix and food and beverage enterprise solution ESB, which bagged US$151 million.
You can find the breakdown below.

Some companies have diversified beyond their initial SaaS offerings. Sirclo, for instance, began as a Shopify-like web store for burgeoning online businesses but has now expanded into a full-fledged ecommerce enabler.
Much of that happened through mergers and acquisitions. Sirclo merged with ecommerce agency Icube in 2020, before going on to acquire new-retail startup Warung Pintar and parenting platform Orami.
Mekari is another acquisition-heavy company. Last year, it acquired CRM platform Qontak shortly after raising US$18 million in series D funding. Qontak joined Mekari‚Äôs suite of products, which includes accounting apps Sleekr and Jurnal, as well as HR management system Talenta.
In this landscape report, we map out the key players in Indonesia‚Äôs SaaS space, look at investment trends, and provide data on the funding rounds we‚Äôre aware of.
Here are the details on the funding rounds that we‚Äôve tracked:

We hope that as we constantly update our database, this will be a useful reference for anyone who‚Äôs interested in Indonesia‚Äôs SaaS space.

Hi readers,
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm the only one who‚Äôs been shopping online more often amid this pandemic. As we go through lockdowns and work from our homes, ecommerce seems like the best choice for buying anything and everything.
Waiting for packages to arrive has become one of my new hobbies lately ‚Äì and maybe many others feel the same way.
That‚Äôs why ecommerce growth continues to rise at a time when several industries are fading. Logistics and other sectors closely tied to ecommerce also do not appear to be in a slump.
Logistics providers are actually getting busier as more people do their shopping online. This explains why companies such as J&amp;T Express ‚Äì an Indonesia-based startup strongly affiliated with Chinese smartphone vendor Oppo ‚Äì are daring to spread their wings outside its home turf.
After venturing into other Southeast Asian countries as well as China, J&amp;T has officially landed in the Middle East. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are the company‚Äôs first two markets in the region.
However, the pandemic is not the only factor that drove J&amp;T Express to go global in such a short time. Its business strategy is also vital to realizing this international ambition.
Still, a big question awaits J&amp;T Express: Can its strategy be sustainable in the long term?

Hello,
A few years ago, I interviewed Kelvin Teo, the co-founder of Funding Societies, on the Startup Snapshot podcast about the challenges the startup faced in its early years.
A lot has happened since that conversation. The SME digital lending platform weathered the pandemic, raised capital a number of times, and even launched its services in new markets. Then this week, the firm raised US$144 million in a series C+ round.
It‚Äôs great to see founders I‚Äôve met take their startups to greater heights ‚Äì in fact, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs one of my favorite things about this job.

All Of Us Are Dead, the latest Korean zombie series on Netflix, was terrible.
There, I said it. If I had to take a shot every time characters did something stupid or stood around doing nothing while someone was getting attacked, I wouldn‚Äôt be alive to write this. I think part of the disappointment stems from my first experience with Korean zombie media, which was Train To Busan. Now that was a great film. I couldn‚Äôt help making comparisons between the two, especially when it came to aspects such as writing and character development.
While my prior enjoyment of Train To Busan might have led to some failed expectations with All Of Us Are Dead, let‚Äôs hope the same fate doesn‚Äôt befall Shopee with its recent foray into India. Going up against entrenched incumbents such as Meesho, Amazon, and Flipkart, the ecommerce giant has its work cut out.

If you live in Southeast Asia, Shopee‚Äôs presence is hard to miss. Whether it‚Äôs the jingle playing over the radio or countless ads plastered at bus stops and shopping malls, the company has cemented a place for itself. But while it has found major success in the region, it‚Äôs a relatively newer player in India, so making a foothold in there won‚Äôt be a walk in the park.


Quick off the blocks: According to Sensor Tower data, Shopee got over 20 million downloads in India after its launch in November 2021.  It was also the second most downloaded shopping app in India for December 2021 and January 2022, placing it just behind Meesho, according to Data.ai.


Sharing is caring: Shopee‚Äôs goal in India is to ‚Äúattract new customers who are coming online for the first time and are looking to make small ticket-size purchases,‚Äù says Satish Meena, co-founder of Sutradhar and a former senior forecast analyst at Forrester. This places Shopee in competition with firms such as Meesho and Snapdeal, which target consumers in Tier 2 and 3 towns.


Rules and regulations: Despite a good start, regulatory headwinds could be on the horizon for Shopee. The Indian government has been on a banning spree of ‚ÄúChina-linked‚Äù apps, and Shopee is at risk of falling under this category.

Startup spotlight
Holding out for a hero

Sydney-based Employment Hero secured US$130 million in its latest fundraise, putting it within reach of unicorn territory and bringing its total funding to US$286 million. Seek Investments led the round, which saw participation from OneVentures, AirTree Ventures, and other shareholders.


Opening new doors: The startup recently acquired KeyPay, an Australian firm that specializes in  workforce and payroll management. The deal acquisition allows Employment Hero to offer a complete suite of employment management solutions and accelerate its growth initiatives in its home market as well as Singapore, Malaysia, New Zealand, and the UK.


On the up: Employment Hero has some lofty goals for the next five years, as it seeks to boost the number of its users from 750,000 to 10 million. It doesn‚Äôt appear to be a pipe dream: The firm posted a growth rate of 110% in the financial year ended March 2021 and expects that figure to remain healthy throughout 2022, according co-founder and CEO Ben Thompson.


Sailing further into SEA: The company is also eyeing further expansion into Southeast Asia by the end of this year. Employment Hero currently serves several SMEs in Singapore and Malaysia, and it has begun hiring for key positions in different markets across Southeast Asia.

The two ecommerce sites join Singapore-based Shopee and other China-based marketplaces such as Baidu Wangpan, DHGate, Pinduoduo, and Taobao in a list of 42 online and 35 offline markets flagged for selling goods that violate intellectual property. There is no sanction for being on the list.

Sequoia partner Shaun Maguire said that the VC views cryptocurrency as a ‚Äúmegatrend‚Äù that would carry on over the next two decades. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the future of money,‚Äù he added.
The company said the cryptocurrency fund will be one of three new sub-funds under Sequoia Capital Fund. These sub-funds will invest capital already committed by the company‚Äôs limited partners, which include university endowments and pension funds. The limited partners can also decide on which sub-fund they would like their capital to be allocated to.
Another Sequoia partner, Michelle Bailhe, said that the recent dips of major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are not concerns for Sequoia, as they are ‚Äúinvesting on a 30-year horizon.‚Äù
‚ÄúIf we‚Äôre in a bear market, we could invest [the new cryptocurrency fund] in under a year,‚Äù Maguire added.

733366,2022-02-18T05:00:37,Investors in UangTeman struggle to claw back their money,"Much of the news around UangTeman, the embattled Indonesian online lender, has revolved around its inability to pay outstanding salaries and other benefits to its former employees.
But a group of 11 individual investors, whose money became the loans that UangTeman disbursed to borrowers, is now speaking up, questioning when (or whether) their investments will be returned.
Since 2020, they have collectively put in 9 billion rupiah (approximately US$628,000) in UangTeman. That amount only covers the principal ‚Äì i.e., it does not include interest and other fees.

Photo credit: UangTeman

One such investor is Edmund (not his real name), who told Tech in Asia that he has been trying to cash out his investments since March 2021. But like UangTeman employees, he was repeatedly told that he would be repaid once the startup receives a cash injection or gets acquired. (UangTeman reportedly found a buyer earlier this year, with the acquisition process to be completed by April.)
That said, Edmund notes that FTI Consulting ‚Äì the firm handling UangTeman‚Äôs bankruptcy proceedings ‚Äì recently contacted the investor group for further discussions. Tech in Asia reached out to FTI Consulting, but the company has yet to reply.
A gradual decline
According to the investors, they heard about UangTeman through a Telegram group that discusses investment opportunities. A convincing factor appears to be UangTeman‚Äôs operational track record (it had been in business for a few years by that point) and its online lending license from Otoritas Jasa Keuangan (OJK), Indonesia‚Äôs financial services authority.
UangTeman had also said that it was planning a pivot from consumptive loans to productive ones (i.e., loans for entrepreneurs and businesses, instead of payday cash loans that the startup had mostly disbursed), says an investor.
Belinda (not her real name) first invested in July 2020 for a three-month term. She had no trouble collecting interest income, and when the company offered an extension with higher interest rates, she agreed.
However, problems began appearing by early 2021. Some UangTeman investors who wanted to cash out their principals were told to wait while others ceased getting their interest income.
‚ÄúI started receiving late interest payments in November 2020,‚Äù recalls Belinda. ‚ÄúIn January 2021, I only received part of the payments, and by February 2021, I stopped receiving anything.‚Äù

UangTeman‚Äôs South Jakarta office has since been sealed by building management.

The other investors who spoke to Tech in Asia affirmed that by March 2021, payments of any kind came to a halt.
According to the investors, Aidil Zulkifli ‚Äì UangTeman‚Äôs erstwhile CEO ‚Äì said in an official company letter that they would be repaid by the end of July 2021. However, they experienced what UangTeman employees already knew ‚Äì the repayment did not materialize.
By September 2021, the investors were referred to FTI Consulting, which had been appointed as UangTeman‚Äôs judicial manager. Records at the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority show that from June 17, 2021, Zulkifli had been disqualified from acting as director of Digital Alpha Group Pte Ltd, UangTeman‚Äôs Singapore-based parent firm.
However, communications with FTI Consulting were minimal, the investors say. By the end of 2021, there was still little clarity on whether they would get their money back.
A murky view
The investors have also raised questions about insurance. According to Edmund, their investments are insured up to 85% of the principal amount. He asked about how to process the claim, but the company did not offer a solution.
A former UangTeman senior executive pointed out that per OJK regulations, all of these investments are insured. However, the insurance only covers events caused by borrowers who fail to repay their loans.
Given these circumstances, no one knows whether these investors can claim the insurance. For one, UangTeman had stopped disbursing loans from April 2020, based on previous reports. Thus, it‚Äôs unclear whether these difficulties were due to non-performing loans or the company‚Äôs deteriorating health.
Ultimately, these investors join a chorus of UangTeman stakeholders who are awaiting repayment. In addition to former staff, there are also vendors whose invoices for services rendered have not been paid.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre quite bloodied by this point,‚Äù says Belinda. ‚ÄúPeople might think that we as investors or lenders have a lot of money. That‚Äôs not necessarily the case, especially in a pandemic.‚Äù",Putra Muskita,Terence Lee and Eileen C. Ang,0,"['Fintech', 'News', 'Premium Content']",True,True,3
733414,2022-02-18T02:00:47,Exclusive: 1982 Ventures announces investments in 5 Indonesian startups,"1982 Ventures, a Singapore-based early-stage VC firm, says it has invested in five Indonesian startups over the past few months.
The firm led or participated in the previously undisclosed rounds of Luna POS, Citcall, HiPajak, Aman, and Monit. Overall, 1982 Ventures‚Äô fintech-focused portfolio now has a total of nine Indonesian startups.
The funding amounts were not disclosed.

With the latest investments, 1982 Ventures now has 21 companies in its portfolio. The VC expects to invest in another 15-20 companies via its first seed-stage fund.
Herston Elton Powers, 1982 Ventures‚Äô managing partner, tells Tech in Asia that Indonesia is a ‚Äúcore market‚Äù for the firm.
‚ÄúThere is no better time to be a fintech investor in Indonesia,‚Äù says Powers, who co-founded the firm with fellow Tryb alumnus Scott Krivokopich. ‚ÄúThe new wave of fintech founders have more resources (e.g., capital, talent, mentors and technology) available to build the next set of unicorns.‚Äù
An oversubscribed round
Among 1982 Ventures‚Äô recent investments is Monit, a fintech startup also backed by Init 6, the VC firm founded by Bukalapak‚Äôs co-founders. Monit describes itself as an ‚Äúintegrated experience‚Äù combining payments, expenses, cash, and corporate cards.
Another firm, Wagely, offers earned wage access (EWA) services and aims to become the go-to financial wellness platform for workers. It operates in Indonesia and Bangladesh, and counts Global Founders Capital as an investor.

Besides investing in Indonesian firms, 1982 Ventures also backed companies from other Southeast Asian countries. These include Infina, a Vietnamese retail investment platform; Bluesheets, a Singapore-based bookkeeping automation platform; and NextPay, a Philippine SME-focused digital bank.
‚ÄúOur investment pipeline for fintech is robust and deep and we expect our deal activity to accelerate,‚Äù Powers says. ‚ÄúAs a fintech specialist fund, 1982 Ventures is able to [perform due] diligence and execute investments very fast.‚Äù
In December 2021, the firm announced the first close of its seed-stage fund at US$12.5 million. Now, Powers says it has reached US$15 million and expects the round to be oversubscribed. The firm is due to announce the final close of the fund in the next few weeks.
As Tech in Asia previously reported, 1982 Ventures‚Äô portfolio had delivered returns of 3x.

733122,2022-02-18T02:00:39,How this digital wallet is accelerating digital financial inclusion in Indonesia,"Small businesses are the powerful heart of the Indonesian economy.
Numbering over 64 million, micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) account for well over half the archipelago‚Äôs total gross domestic product. MSMEs collectively employ 97% of Indonesian workers and are key to the future of the nation‚Äôs development.
Covid-19 dealt a major blow to these firms, with supply chain disruptions and low demand shuttering over 70% of these businesses either temporarily or permanently. As a result, the Indonesian economy spiraled into its first recession since the 1998 Asian financial crisis, triggering a wake up call for MSMEs to digitalize quickly to counter movement restrictions and fewer in-person transactions.
A lifeline for MSMEs
Over the course of the pandemic, digital platforms have proven to be a lifeline for MSMEs by allowing them to connect with the 21 million new digital customers who have come online.
There has been a marked uptick in digitalized services in Indonesia. According to Google‚Äôs 2021 e-Conomy report, 98% of Indonesia‚Äôs digital merchants now accept digital payments, and more than half offer online lending solutions.
‚ÄúThe pandemic has made us aware of the need to improve innovation, adaptation, and skills ‚Äì not only by selling and making payments online, but also creating creative content so that business can continue to be sustainable,‚Äù Sandiaga Uno, Indonesia‚Äôs Minister of Tourism and Creative Economy (Menparekraf), said at a webinar organized by Indonesian e-wallet firm Dana in August 2021. He views the pandemic as a catalyst that could bring a sea change for MSMEs.
Vince Iswara, Dana‚Äôs chief executive and co-founder, says the digitalization of MSME businesses is ‚Äúinevitable,‚Äù and would create the ‚Äúability to avoid the risk of face-to-face payments and strengthen business opportunities to survive during these uncertain times.‚Äù

Vince Iswara, CEO and co-founder of Dana / Photo credit: Dana

However, although 13.7 million MSMEs entered Indonesia‚Äôs digital ecosystem amid the pandemic, Sandiaga noted that they only account for 12.5% of the entire industry, hinting at the huge potential for Dana‚Äôs digitalized payments platform to spur the economy‚Äôs development.
Educating for a financially-inclusive Indonesia
‚ÄúDana was built from our belief that technology is an enabler to move people forward including Indonesia,‚Äù says Iswara. ‚ÄúAs a nation with a lot of potential and great resources, Indonesia still faces problems because we are divided by the ocean and land ‚Äì it makes it impossible to move goods and transact easily.‚Äù
Dana ‚Äì named after the Bahasa Indonesia word for ‚Äúfunds‚Äù ‚Äì sees the solution to the country‚Äôs geographical challenges in Dana‚Äôs vision of a ‚Äúcashless society.‚Äù Founded in 2018, Dana‚Äôs app-based platform offers an all-in-one solution that allows customers and businesses to make and receive digital payments conveniently.
‚ÄúWe are focused on becoming the bridge to all economic ecosystems,‚Äù says Iswara. ‚ÄúEspecially by connecting more banked or underserved peoples for better access to financial technology and literacy.‚Äù
Iswara calls these solutions ‚Äúdigital payments 4.0,‚Äù referencing the much-vaunted Industrial Revolution 4.0 that could pave a path for the future of business through technology and online platforms.
Dana‚Äôs e-wallet offering is underpinned by educational initiatives and collaborative partnerships that aim to tackle some of Indonesia‚Äôs persistent societal challenges such as a lack of skilled talent, market access, and financial inclusion.
For example, Dana Bisnis, the startup‚Äôs enterprise-facing offering, makes it easier for MSMEs to accept digital transactions through QR codes and keep records in real time. When the take-up of this technology rose sharply over the last year, Dana began offering complimentary education and training to help MSMEs make the most of its solutions. Dana has been able to connect to 14 million QRIS (Quick Response Code Indonesian Standard) merchants with the help of the standardized QR code from Bank Indonesia.
‚ÄúDuring the pandemic, we continued to provide assistance and training virtually to encourage optimal absorption of knowledge,‚Äù says Iswara. ‚ÄúAs a result, the number of Dana Bisnis MSME partners has grown, as has their digital financial literacy.‚Äù
Building a bridge for Indonesia‚Äôs unbanked
Dana‚Äôs aspirations for a ‚Äúcashless society‚Äù have produced significant synergies between the startup and the Indonesian government, which launched its own ‚Äúno cash‚Äù movement back in 2014. As a result, Dana‚Äôs initiatives contain an element of national service, which has gained steam as MSMEs struggle to recover from the pandemic.
These struggles stem from a lack of access to basic financial services like bank accounts. Most MSMEs operate in an informal market that doesn‚Äôt require business registrations, which further complicates their access to credit lines and cash-based aid.
‚ÄúDuring the pandemic, we initiated our ‚ÄòDaftarkan Warung Sekitar Kamu‚Äô program, in part to support the initiatives of the Ministry of Cooperatives and SMEs,‚Äù says Iswara. ‚ÄúThis is a community-based initiative where users can help register a warung (a brick-and-mortar business) by using our app.‚Äù
The registration campaign is part of the startup‚Äôs ‚ÄúSiap Siaga Covid-19‚Äù program ‚Äì an umbrella initiative in collaboration with digital donation platform Kitabisa.com to raise donations from the general public to help pandemic-hit businesses.
Despite its internet-savvy population, Indonesia is home to the world‚Äôs third-largest unbanked population. In order to combat this persistent issue, Dana collaborates with Women‚Äôs World Banking (WWB) ‚Äì a nonprofit that promotes gender-sensitive financial inclusion ‚Äì and local authorities to expand MSMEs‚Äô access to digital financial services.

‚ÄúOur WWB program aims to increase digital financial literacy, helping people to adapt to existing and emerging challenges for the welfare of their families,‚Äù Iswara says.
Aside from facilitating access to financial aid, Dana has also helped MSMEs gain access to new markets and users by digitalizing the fundamentals of logistics, especially as lockdown policies have limited consumer movement.
‚ÄúWith Bhanda Ghara Reksa Logistics, we launched our Miniservice Warung Pangan to help regular people access affordable food staples and empower MSMEs by opening up this market,‚Äù says Iswara.
He also shares that through its Dana Delivery service, the startup enables brick-and-mortar MSMEs digitalize their logistics via a network of couriers to deliver goods to a wider pool of customers.
Empowering the MSME through education
From an education standpoint, Dana has also played an active role in boosting skills of local MSME entrepreneurs. Through the Dana Academy, the startup has empowered more than 400,000 Dana Bisnis entrepreneurs with skills covering health and safety, business management, and digital marketing.
‚ÄúIn Dana, our tech and capabilities allow us to go beyond making great fintech products, transferring knowledge and skills to improve the quality life of all Indonesians,‚Äù says Iswara.

Photo credit: Dana

He adds that the startup‚Äôs Dana Untuk Negeri initiative enables its employees to volunteer with MSMEs in designated cities. For Iswara, these activities are key in building trust between Dana and its wider community.
‚ÄúThis trust gives us the ability to remain in communication with our business partners to discuss and find solutions on how to continue to work in accordance with the current context, where health is a priority for all of us,‚Äù he says.
Iswara also notes that Dana is ‚Äúvery optimistic‚Äù about the job opportunities for all Indonesians presented by Southeast Asia‚Äôs growing internet economy, especially in areas like food delivery and ecommerce.
The focus, he says, will be on financially -underserved populations, taking advantage of the next two years of growth in the digital financial services sector.

Dana‚Äôs open platform is designed to promote financial inclusion and literacy for MSMEs and customers all across Indonesia by reimagining the potential of the all-in-one digital wallet.

733359,2022-02-18T01:00:51,Exclusive: üáÆüá© proptech firm bags funding from Sinar Mas unit,"Jendela360, an Indonesian proptech startup, has raised an undisclosed amount of series A funding from a subsidiary of Indonesian conglomerate Sinar Mas Group.

(From left) Jendela360 founders Kiki Guzali, Daniel Rannu, and Ade Indra / Photo credit: Jendela360

Founded in 2016, Jendela360 is a digital property brokerage that initially focused on long-term apartment rentals. It was one of the earliest startups in Indonesia that used 360-degree virtual tours to attract customers. About six months ago, it expanded into the property buying and selling business.
The company was established by serial entrepreneur Daniel Rannu, former real estate advisor Kiki Guzali, and Ade Indra, who has experience in the hospitality business.
According to a statement, Jendela360 saw a 4x growth in sales and revenue in the past 18 months amid the pandemic. ‚ÄúI can say that we are the largest offline-to-online proptech that handles buying and rental in Indonesia,‚Äù Rannu told Tech in Asia.
Despite its quick growth, the firm said that it is operationally profitable.
Jendela360 currently operates in the Jakarta and Tangerang areas and has around 95 employees. It plans to raise more funding soon to fuel nationwide expansion in the next two years.
Riding the pandemic wave
When the Covid-19 pandemic hit Indonesia, Rannu admitted that he was worried it would cause an armageddon for the country‚Äôs property industry. ‚ÄúWe saw the travel industry going down. So I thought, ‚ÄòWho will buy property in this hard time?'‚Äù he recalled.
Internally, the company‚Äôs sales went down by 30%, so Rannu decided to downsize the team, especially the marketing division. However, he soon realized that the pandemic would actually provide tailwinds for the industry.
For instance, it pushed people to try digital solutions when looking for properties. ‚ÄúThey have no option to come directly to the property, so our virtual tours feature is the best that they can use,‚Äù Rannu said.
Other than that, property developers also adjusted to the health crisis by building real estate with ‚Äúpost-pandemic‚Äù designs, such as the availability of space to work and exercise from home.
With the positive trend, Jendela360 moved to the property buying and selling business and offered shorter-term apartment rentals. The firm used to only process one-year rentals, but now it also accepts demands for three-month leases.
Staying away from the marketplace model
Before raising its series A round, Jendela360 had raised US$1.2 million from two rounds of funding. In 2018, it received seed funding from Prasetia Dwidharma and Everhaus, which was followed by a US$1 million pre-series A round¬†led by Beenext in 2020.
The key to surviving with a smaller war chest, Rannu said, is the company‚Äôs business model, which focuses on the entire transaction ‚Äì from negotiations to payments. This allows the firm to get higher margins as opposed to companies that employ the marketplace model, which connects customers with property agents and only gets revenue from subscription fees.
Another advantage of facilitating the whole transaction is the abundance of data that Jendela360 can collect.
‚ÄúOne interesting example is the fact that a landlord who has houses usually also has apartments that can be rented and shophouses that can be bought. Thus, the industry is actually connected,‚Äù Rannu shared. ‚ÄúIf we can get and use the data, it can become our advantage.‚Äù
According to the co-founder, this is one of the reasons he raised funding from an entity affiliated with the Sinar Mas Group, which is one of the largest property developers in the country.

Moving forward, Jendela360 plans to expand its property buying and selling business to the secondary markets by 2024. The Indonesian property secondary market is a 300 trillion rupiah (around US$21 billion) business, 3x larger than the primary market, said Rannu. He also believes that the market will continue to grow.
‚ÄúIndonesian people still have a conservative mindset. After renting an apartment for two to three years, they will have an intention to buy houses as their income also increases,‚Äù he concluded.",Aditya Hadi Pratama,Collin Furtado and Jaclyn Tiu,0,"['Investments', 'News', 'Premium Content', 'Startups']",True,True,3

Some say health is wealth. For India-based startup Goqii, health has been an opportunity for growth. The startup recently raised US$50 million in a series C round led by Sumeru Ventures, a global VC firm, to help it on its journey.


Get healthy: Founded in 2014 by Vishal Gondal, who previously served as a managing director at The Walt Disney Company, Goqii offers a wide range of health-focused services that include wearable fitness bands, personalized remote coaching, and diagnostics.


Let‚Äôs grow: The recent fundraise will fuel Goqii‚Äôs expansion into other markets in Asia and the US through partnerships with insurance, healthcare, or independent service providers. Heightened competition in the healthcare sector may be why the firm is doubling down on its insurance offerings, creating a 360-degree approach to healthcare.


On the upward trajectory: It‚Äôs exciting times for Goqii ‚Äì the firm is doing well, having seen its revenue increase by 250% since the start of the pandemic. It aims to have 2 million monthly active users by the end of 2022, see US$100 million in revenue in the next 18 to 24 months, and make its stock market debut within the next year and a half.

Around half of these soon-to-be unicorns ‚Äì or soonicorns ‚Äì have valuations that are less than US$300 million away from reaching unicorn status, according to Tech in Asia‚Äòs analysis.

These soonicorns come from various countries as well. However, as with the current list of unicorns in the region, most of these startups hail from Singapore and Indonesia.

A lot of these soonicorns also share the same investors. Similar to Tech in Asia‚Äòs list of Southeast Asian unicorns, the investors backing the most number of soonicorns are Sequoia Capital, Venturra Capital, East Ventures, and Jungle Ventures, among others.
About half of the region‚Äôs soonicorns appear in at least one of the portfolios of the VC firms listed below. So far, Venturra Capital has backed the most soonicorns in the region, with four investments in such startups.

This is in addition to the US$165 million it raised for the same round last month, when it secured a coveted spot in the unicorn club after its valuation reached US$1.6 billion. The Tiger Global-led round saw participation from Alpha Wave Global, Kora Investment, DF International Partners, and Twenty Nine Capital Partners.
According to the startup, the latest round brings its total funds raised to date to US$393 million, and it currently stands at a valuation of US$1.7 billion.
Middle East and SEA in sight
DealShare founder and CEO Vineet Rao told Tech in Asia that the company is preparing to expand its footprint overseas. It plans to start with markets in the Gulf Cooperation Council such as the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman, Kuwait, and Bahrain. It will soon set up an office in Abu Dhabi.
The company plans to tap into Southeast Asia as well. Rao revealed that DealShare will initially roll out in Indonesia before expanding to other neighboring markets.
Rao did not give a concrete timeline for the international rollout, but he said it may take up to six months as the company is setting up a team for this purpose.
Moving toward profitability
Rao said that DealShare is aiming to break even in India by the end of the year.
‚ÄúWe are finalizing our plans to identify key areas of investment that will help drive to operational profitability,‚Äù he added.
Rao‚Äôs optimism is based on the fast-paced growth the company has recorded in recent months. He revealed that DealShare was managing about 200,000 square feet of warehousing at the beginning of last year, which has now grown to about 2.5 million square feet.

The firm currently has 10 million registered users, which it is hoping to increase this by up to 4x soon. The company is handling an average of nearly 400,000 orders daily across 130 cities in the country.
Rao added that the company is aiming to achieve a US$1 billion annualized run rate (ARR) by March. This will be significantly higher than the nearly US$50 million ARR the company had at the beginning of 2021.
‚ÄúWe are likely to hit US$3 billion of gross revenue run rate in the next 12 months. We will be tripling our geographical presence, investing heavily on acquiring top-notch tech talent, and building world-class supply chain infrastructure to aid this growth along with a continued focus on capital efficiency and path to profitability,‚Äù Sourjyendu Medda, DealShare co-founder and chief business officer, said in a statement.

DealShare is also looking to diversify its product portfolio to add general merchandise ‚Äì primarily focused on fashion and electronics ‚Äì and fresh produce categories. The company already has a sizable section of staples and has added FMCG, home care, and personal care items as well.
Going forward, the company will strengthen its FMCG category as well as push its general merchandise and fresh produce selections. Rao hopes the newer categories will soon contribute up to 40% of the company‚Äôs total revenues.
DealShare‚Äôs rise comes at a time when the social commerce space in India is growing at a rapid pace. According to a Bain &amp; Company report, social commerce in India is expected to be worth up to US$20 billion in total gross merchandise value by 2025 and hit between US$60 billion and US$70 billion by 2030.

Delivered every Thursday via email and through the Tech in Asia website, this free newsletter breaks down the biggest stories and trends in ecommerce. If you‚Äôre not a subscriber, get access by registering here.
Hi there,
Privilege hit me hard across the face the other day when a parcel arrived and I couldn‚Äôt,¬†for the life of me, remember what I had ordered. In an age when deliveries come thick and fast, it can be easy to lose track of things that are not a priority.
My colleague Samreen found out that it can take newer entrants in India‚Äôs ecommerce space (read: Shopee) over a week to get packages delivered. But those who value discounts and bargains over speed might want to give Shopee a shot after reading Samreen‚Äôs report on Shopee‚Äôs foray into India.
I can‚Äôt help but wonder if Forrest Li, the chairman and CEO of Sea Group, has a world map in his office to mark all the markets Shopee has ventured into, and the places he‚Äôd like for it to go.
But the path to global domination won‚Äôt be easy, given the challenges coming Shopee‚Äôs way, as Simon writes in this week‚Äôs Big Story. When Shopee was still up and coming, its growth was aided by the fact that Alibaba-owned Lazada had its own troubles. But that seems to be a thing of the past. Besides, Indonesia‚Äôs GoTo is also proving to be a strong contender in the region.
Shopee doesn‚Äôt want to leave anything to chance: It quietly launched a food delivery business in Indonesia in 2021 and is rapidly expanding in other countries. But as Simon explains, this expansion also comes with risks.

THE BIG STORYWhat could go wrong for Shopee?

Shopee dominates ecommerce in Southeast Asia, but it can‚Äôt afford to rest easy as the competition gets fierce and its rapid expansion carries risks.

THE HOT TAKEWhy India‚Äôs q-commerce firms are turning to private labels

Image credit: Zepto

Here‚Äôs what happened:

Two of India‚Äôs leading quick commerce firms, Swiggy‚Äôs Instamart and Zepto, are set to launch private labels.
Zepto plans to sell staples, general merchandise, and cooking essentials under its own brand by the second or third quarter of this year.
Swiggy‚Äôs Instamart will introduce its first private label through cleaning supplies next month.

Here‚Äôs our take:
Tapioca, sweet potato, banana, or perhaps jackfruit? The mom and pop store down my street has plenty of chips to choose from, including a shelf of unbranded packets. His wife made these, he says. ‚ÄúThese are cheaper and better.‚Äù
Launching private labels is a road well traveled. For instance, Amazon sports a number of private labels, including AmazonBasics.
But private labels in the hyperlocal delivery space are a relatively new trend, though several of Instamart and Zepto‚Äôs competitors ‚Äì like Reliance Retail-backed Dunzo ‚Äì already have their brands in place. At least two quick commerce companies in the US ‚Äì Gopuff and Buyk ‚Äì launched their private brands this January.
Despite the thrill of having ice creams, groceries, and plant pots being delivered quicker as superfast deliveries become the norm, the spotlight remains firmly on the trend‚Äôs economic sustainability. Margins in the grocery delivery space are notoriously wafer thin.
This is where private labels offer the proverbial ray of hope. Selling in-house products can make for fatter margins than expensive third-party brands. Zepto‚Äôs Aadit Palicha says that its private labels will add 3% to the firm‚Äôs operating earnings margin.
At Milkbasket, another grocery delivery firm, private labels contributed 20% to 22% of the startup‚Äôs revenue in 2020. Acquired by Reliance Retail in late 2021, the startup expected those numbers to double as it added more private labels.
At least one company, however, is going against the grain.
BlinkIt (previously known as Grofers), backed by Softbank and Zomato, had experimented with private labels as far back as 2016. A few years down the line, private labels made up as much as 50% of BlinkIt‚Äôs gross merchandise value. But as the firm pivoted to quick commerce late last year, it scaled down its private labels.

For representation purposes only / Image credit: 123rf.com

While it‚Äôs unclear why BlinkIt did this, private labels have their own set of challenges, including manufacturing, quality control, and consumer perception. The last is of particular concern because in-house brands being markedly cheaper than premium-priced products might suggest that the former are inferior in quality.
Southeast Asia‚Äôs consumer segments, demographically similar to India‚Äôs, are willing to try new brands across categories, according to a recent report by McKinsey. With price tags of private label brands being 10% to 20% lower than national brands, the McKinsey report says such brands increased margins for firms over a five-year period.
Palicha believes the trick for successful private labels is to choose categories where customers have the least amount of brand loyalty and can be easily swapped with substitutes.
But the road to promising revenues is paved with speed bumps ‚Äì the latest being reservations from the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT). The trade organization has been asking for a tighter leash on ecommerce.
Ecommerce marketplaces shouldn‚Äôt own brands or create private labels, says CAIT‚Äôs Praveen Khandelwal. The argument comes at a time when India is finalizing its policy on ecommerce.
CAIT says marketplaces should be neutral and treat all sellers on an equal footing. Across platforms, private labels are often displayed more prominently than others.
The stakes are high in the tussle between the CAIT and ecommerce portals ‚Äì India‚Äôs quick commerce market is expected to touch US$5 billion by 2025, according to a RedSeer report.
That said, business isn‚Äôt as forgiving as Wordle. The quick commerce firms may not get many chances to get private labels just right.

732898,2022-02-17T04:00:00,How to navigate the challenges of Vietnam‚Äôs digital bank scene,"In Southeast Asia‚Äôs finance space, the phrase ‚Äòdigital bank‚Äô is exciting. Across the region, new fintech firms, tech companies, and incumbent banks are launching digital banking services in place of physical branches.
Vietnam is no exception, and digital banks have plenty of potential to make a difference in the country. It is home to a young population ‚Äì one that seeks flexible and efficient digital services and solutions, and while 70% of Vietnamese adults do have a bank account, many of them remain underserved and lack access to other financial products such as investments and credit.

Plus, the nation‚Äôs central bank approved electronic know-your-customer (eKYC) processes in 2020 to allow users to open of bank accounts online, making it easier for citizens to set up bank accounts and reap the benefits of banking.
Despite these developments, digital banks haven‚Äôt had an easy time in the country.
A challenging market
Unlike other markets in Southeast Asia such as Singapore and Indonesia, which have launched digital bank licenses for non-banking players, Vietnam‚Äôs regulations for digital banks are not clearly defined. This means that any startup looking to launch a digital bank has to partner up with an existing bank, which can slow down the process significantly.
‚ÄúIt commonly takes six months to a year for a traditional bank to develop new products and services, due to all the processes and guidelines involved,‚Äù says Nguyen Huu Quang, CEO of Cake, the digital banking arm of Be Group, which operates Vietnamese ride-hailing service Be.

While Vietnam has a young population, many are hesitant about digital banking services, citing concerns such as identity theft and security. Financial literacy in Vietnam is still low, which makes it difficult for banks to get users to use services beyond opening a savings account.
Navigating roadblocks
Cake is one digital bank that‚Äôs rising to the challenge of serving Vietnam‚Äôs underbanked consumers. Launched in 2021 as a joint venture between Be Group and VPBank, Cake aims to be a ‚Äúsimple, trusted, and delightful bank‚Äù that brings greater financial inclusion to Vietnamese citizens by making digital banking via mobile phones easy and accessible.
According to Nguyen, Cake seemed like a natural extension of what Be Group aims to do with its mobility services: bringing convenience to its users. The firm worked with VPBank, which is one of Vietnam‚Äôs largest lenders, to develop the Cake platform, using the incumbent‚Äôs expertise and experience to build its framework. It then worked with fintech firms to accelerate the development process.

Photo credit: Cake

Cake worked closely with cloud banking platform Mambu to develop a full suite of banking services like those of established banks.
Cake opted to use Mambu‚Äôs cloud solutions as the basis of its core banking system ‚Äì the back-end technologies involved in key banking activities such as account opening and transactions processing. By using cloud banking, Cake can launch new services within weeks, where traditional core banking systems took years. Additionally, it transformed its core banking system in just 74 days ‚Äì a record in Asia.
Cake also inked a partnership with payments solutions firm Radar Payments to develop its end-to-end payments infrastructure.
‚ÄúWith the help of these fintech firms, it only takes one to two months to deliver new products to customers,‚Äù shares Nguyen. ‚ÄúThis allows us to invest more into the people, products, and marketing behind Cake, instead of on the development process.‚Äù
Getting customers on board
Customer acquisition remains a significant challenge for digital banks, but Cake‚Äôs connection with Be Group helped it overcome this barrier. The digital bank saved on customer acquisition costs as it already had a large pool of potential customers from the drivers and users who use Be Group‚Äôs ride-hailing services and trust its technology.
Cake focused on integrating its platform with the Be app, enabling drivers and customers to seamlessly make payments on Be via Cake. Be Group ecosystem‚Äôs also added value to Cake‚Äôs offerings, giving customers access to services such as ride hailing, hotel bookings, and even insurance.
‚ÄúThrough this, Cake was able to offer clients financial services and smooth payments, as well as a rapid and secure experience throughout the pandemic,‚Äù adds Nguyen.
The firm also has staff to guide users through setting up an account on Cake, navigating the eKYC process, and understanding the digital bank‚Äôs offerings.
Cake is also aware of the fact that Vietnam‚Äôs tech-savvy youth are a large segment of its target audience. That‚Äôs why the firm positioned itself as ‚Äúmore than a banking service,‚Äù adding small but significant features to draw in the younger generation.
For example, the bank, in partnership with MasterCard, offers its customers an international debit card in colors and designs that appeal to young consumers. It also lets users add creative elements to transactions.

‚ÄúCake aims to boost engagement in each transaction ‚Äì for example, when you make a transfer, you can add emojis or message cards to the transaction, showing off your creativity,‚Äù says Nguyen. ‚ÄúThis helps meet the demands of young customers for creative offerings, and shows that Cake is more than just a financial product ‚Äì it‚Äôs also a platform to send messages, express sentiments, and develop trust.‚Äù
These approaches have served Cake well: The firm had 1 million customers on its platform by the end of 2021 ‚Äì within just 11 months of operation ‚Äì and is looking to roll out even more offerings, including microfinancing solutions, in 2022.
‚ÄúWe set a goal of having one million users at the beginning of 2021, and we achieved it despite it being extremely challenging,‚Äù shares Nguyen. ‚ÄúBy investing in technology infrastructure and having quick and flexible leadership, we were able to achieve this.‚Äù
To a digitally-banked future
As the Covid-19 pandemic continues to drive digitalization and bring more people into the digital economy, Nguyen is confident that digital banks ‚Äì and fintech as a whole ‚Äì will flourish in Vietnam.
In his view, there will be greater collaboration between banks and fintech firms, and technology like AI and big data will help change the way people bank.
‚ÄúThe industry will be producing new financial products quicker and more affordably,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThe Covid-19 pandemic has fundamentally altered user behavior, and the digital economy will continue to expand dramatically in the near term ‚Äì digital transformation is inevitable.‚Äù

Such arrangements are common in founder-led companies, and Li ‚Äì along with Chris Feng, CEO of ecommerce arm Shopee ‚Äì has steered Sea to become a leading global consumer internet player.

But what should have been a day of celebration for Li ended with Sea‚Äôs New York Stock Exchange-listed shares dropping by a whopping 18%. This was due to reports that Free Fire ‚Äì the best-selling game of Sea‚Äôs digital entertainment unit, Garena ‚Äì was included in a list of apps to be banned in India. The government is moving to restrict apps that are deemed to be of Chinese origin, saying that they pose a threat to India‚Äôs national security.
Investors fear that this ban could be extended to include Shopee, which would deal a further blow to Sea‚Äôs global aspirations.
Despite the sizable dip in Sea‚Äôs share price recently, institutional analysts remain enthusiastic about its prospects. Nine out of 10 recommend buying the stock, with none rating it as underweight or sell. (The recommendations haven‚Äôt accounted for the recent India-related news, though.)

Revitalized competitors
Along with Garena and financial services unit SeaMoney, Shopee is one of Sea‚Äôs three main pillars and dominates ecommerce in Southeast Asia.

Shopee‚Äôs early days coincided with a period of turmoil at Alibaba-owned Lazada, which was then poised to capture the region‚Äôs ecommerce market.
But Lazada seems to have left its troubles behind. In late 2021, Alibaba announced an executive reshuffling that saw Jiang Fan, who previously led its flagship Taobao and Tmall divisions, heading a new international digital commerce division that includes Lazada and AliExpress.

In a presentation at Alibaba‚Äôs 2021 Investor Day, Lazada Group CEO Chun Li committed to boosting the company‚Äôs gross merchandise value from US$21 billion to US$100 billion. However, he didn‚Äôt specify a timeframe for this fivefold growth.
This is significant because it was the first time that the Hangzhou-headquartered titan revealed separate numbers for Lazada. Tightening regulatory pressures in China have made other markets, especially Southeast Asia, more important to Alibaba.
‚ÄúUp until recently, the management of Lazada has just been a rotating queue of people flown in from Hangzhou for 12 months,‚Äù observes Jeffrey Towson, a technology equity investor and professor at Sasin School of Management in Bangkok. ‚ÄúThey know they gave [Shopee] a huge opening. That is probably the thing they‚Äôre fixing.‚Äù
Another competitor to watch is Indonesia‚Äôs GoTo, which was formed after the merger between tech giants Gojek and Tokopedia. GoTo‚Äôs much-anticipated IPO is expected to happen as early as this quarter.
Tokopedia and Shopee have been competing neck and neck in Indonesia for years. While Shopee has the leading app, Tokopedia‚Äôs website was the most visited in Q3 2021.

In its home turf of Indonesia ‚Äì also Southeast Asia‚Äôs largest market ‚Äì GoTo can leverage Gojek‚Äôs wider range of goods and services, which outnumber what Shopee offers. On the delivery front, Gojek‚Äôs fleet of drivers can strengthen Tokopedia‚Äôs last-mile capabilities.
‚ÄúThe No. 1 synergy is consumers,‚Äù says Towson. ‚ÄúYou have more activity by consumers. You can link your two apps together. You can cross-sell. That decreases your marketing costs.‚Äù
If GoTo‚Äôs IPO proceeds this year, it will also alleviate any capital-related challenges, enabling Tokopedia to continue fending off Shopee in Indonesia.
Ng Weiyi, assistant professor of strategy and policy at the National University of Singapore (NUS) Business School, notes that platforms are ‚Äúfighting for consumers‚Äô limited mindshare.‚Äù As a result of the merger, Tokopedia has ‚Äúthe potential to reach and convert Gojek‚Äôs extensive user base‚Äù in addition to leveraging the super app‚Äôs ‚Äúlogistical prowess.‚Äù

By offering consumers a convenient way to scratch their shopping itch, Tokopedia can eat into the time they spend on Shopee.
However, Shopee also moves fast. To plug the gaps in its offerings, it quietly entered Indonesia‚Äôs food delivery scene in April 2021. As Tech in Asia noted in an analysis of this development, the move ‚Äúcan increase the app‚Äôs stickiness, and in turn, inspire more users to shop on its ecommerce platform.‚Äù
The popularity of social commerce
Despite the rise of marketplaces, social channels remain indispensable to Southeast Asia‚Äôs consumers, who prefer to chat directly with buyers and settle payments upon delivery.
In the first half of 2021, Taiwan-based AI solutions provider iKala surveyed consumers in Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand, and found that 78% already use social media to shop. This is second only to ecommerce platforms (91%).
US-based Meta‚Äôs family of apps ‚Äì Facebook, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram ‚Äì are widely popular in Southeast Asia, and Towson thinks it‚Äôs a ‚Äúsleeping giant‚Äù that could be the ‚Äúbiggest existential threat‚Äù to Shopee‚Äôs position in the region.

However, Meta has been slow to leverage its strengths in this area. ‚ÄúThey have the most under-utilized assets,‚Äù Towson tells Tech in Asia. He added that if Tencent ‚Äì the Chinese tech major that operates super app WeChat ‚Äì owned WhatsApp, ‚Äúthis game would have been over five years ago.‚Äù
NUS associate professor Ng shares the same sentiment. Sellers obviously want to be on Shopee to access a large number of customers, but the platform is not their only option. ‚ÄúIf I can find my own customers somewhere else, at a much lower cost, I‚Äôm going to do that. The rise of direct selling through social media and messaging reflects this,‚Äù he points out.
With other options to reach customers directly, it could be hard for Shopee to increase its take rate.
This dovetails with the position of Lin, the independent analyst who is bearish on Shopee. He questions whether ‚Äútake rate expansion will affect [Shopee‚Äôs] ability to grow and retain market share, considering that its growth has come from undercutting on price, aggressive sales promotions, and its competitors are not to be underestimated.‚Äù
The risks of breakneck expansion
Shopee‚Äôs expenses are expected to continue rising as the company ventures into new markets and segments.
Sea isn‚Äôt content with Shopee being No. 1 in Southeast Asia. In addition to Latin America and India, Shopee has also expanded into Europe and most recently, South Korea.
Can Sea sustain this growth momentum?
First, the sheer number of new markets to manage raises the risk that Shopee will lose focus in its core markets, which are heterogeneous and have a unique mix of competitors.
See also: Brazil could become Shopee‚Äôs biggest market, beating even Indonesia
Lin argues that because many of Shopee‚Äôs markets are relatively small in size but have high population densities, they have ‚Äúvery low‚Äù barriers to entry. As such, they provide incumbents with less of an advantage than Amazon has in the US.
Towson concurs, saying that while ‚ÄúShopee might take its eye off the ball,‚Äù he thinks that the company is a ‚Äúnatural-born multinational.‚Äù That‚Äôs why ‚Äúgoing to Poland and Latin America is no different‚Äù from what Shopee did five years ago, when it expanded beyond Singapore and ventured into other Southeast Asian markets.
Even as Shopee has extended its geographic reach, its average order size has been falling.

While that suggests consumers are buying online more frequently, the number will have to go up over time for Shopee to be financially sustainable.
Second, Shopee‚Äôs rapid expansion and increasing size could spark pushback from incumbents and regulators.
For example, it has faced scrutiny from consumer groups in Malaysia and the Philippines as well as a trade group in India.
Following news of the Indian government banning Garena, the Confederation of All India Traders renewed its call for Shopee to be banned.
While the possibility of an outright ban is India-specific, escalating geopolitical tensions and the perception that Sea is a Chinese company may expose it to further attacks as it ventures into new markets.
Garena‚Äôs slowing growth
Shopee‚Äôs success so far has been enabled by the positive returns generated by its sister firm, digital entertainment player Garena.
In the most recent 12-month period (Q4 2020 to Q3 2021), Shopee had a negative adjusted EBITDA of US$2.1 billion. This amount was covered by the US$2.8 billion of EBITDA made in the same period by Garena.


However, Garena‚Äôs growth has been on a decline. The growth in quarterly active users and bookings for Q3 2021 was the slowest of the previous 11 quarters. This may feed into sluggish future EBITDA growth, which will hamper Garena‚Äôs ability to subsidize losses at Shopee.
With US$12.5 billion of cash on its balance sheet, Sea certainly has the resources to absorb a significant period of losses.
But ecommerce is not the only area that will need funding as Sea also has big plans for financial services. Tech in Asia made some calculations, and we estimate that SeaMoney lost over US$600 million in the most recent 12-month period. Moreover, its digital banking ambitions will require even higher levels of investment.
Fiercer competition in ecommerce and a reduced ability to make the required investment via profits from Garena will push Sea to raise more funding from the market. However, such a move would come with its own set of problems.

Photo credit: Garena

Sea‚Äôs share price, like those of other fast-growing tech companies, has been battered by expectations that the Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policy in response to high inflation levels in the US. This has contributed to a 42% year-to-date drop in its shares, which are down by over 60% from their peak in November 2021 (as of February 14).
A lower share price will not directly impact Shopee‚Äôs business. However, it does mean that Sea‚Äôs existing shareholders will have to suffer a greater level of dilution in order to raise the same amount of money, compared to if the share price was higher.
Shopee has gone from strength to strength, so it isn‚Äôt easy to envisage a situation where it finds itself on the backfoot. But it‚Äôs set to face some growing pains in the coming years.
The same applies to its parent firm. As Li pointed out at the annual shareholders‚Äô meeting, Sea has been in business for only 12 years. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still a young kid,‚Äù the CEO and chairman reportedly added.",Simon Huang,"Thu Huong Le, Terence Lee, and Eileen C.

With this round, the startup‚Äôs valuation has nearly reached unicorn status at AU$1.25 billion (US$901.5 million).
Employment Hero helps businesses manage their workforce through the changing nature of work by helping teams stay connected through fully integrated HR solutions.
The funding will be used to create solutions in ways that will transform what businesses and their employees can expect from employment, creating well-rounded experiences for employees and employers alike, Ben Thompson, co-founder and CEO of Employment Hero, told Tech in Asia in an email.
‚Äú70% of all jobs are provided by SMEs, but most business owners still feel anxious, under qualified and under-resourced as employers. Our mission is to create as many quality employment opportunities as possible by offering a comprehensive and user-friendly HR system,‚Äù said Thompson.
With the latest round, the Sydney-based startup has raised US$286 million in funding to date.
A key acquisition
Employment Hero has also acquired KeyPay, an Australia-based workforce management and payroll solution.
While the deal size was not disclosed, Thompson said the KeyPay acquisition will allow Employment Hero to offer a complete suite of employment management solutions that covers four key pillars: talent solutions, core HR, payroll, and e-benefits. Thompson had earlier been a seed investor in KeyPay.

Ben Thompson, co-founder and CEO, Employment Hero / Photo credit: Employment Hero

Founded in 2010 by Phil Bernie, Richard McLean, Paul Duran, and Kristian Reynolds, KeyPay has a footprint across Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand, and the UK. This acquisition will allow Employment Hero to further accelerate its growth initiatives in these markets, said Thompson.
KeyPay will remain an independent brand and co-founders Bernie and Duran will stay at the startup as managing director and CTO, respectively.
Tracking growth
Founded in 2014 by Thompson and Dave Tong, Employment Hero now serves over 80,000 businesses, collectively managing over 750,000 employees. Its core platform reduces administration time by up to 80%, the startup said.
Within the next five years, it is looking at making employment more valuable for 10 million employees worldwide.
The company saw a growth rate of 110% in the financial year ended March 2021 and expects the figure to remain healthy throughout 2022, Thompson told Tech in Asia. 
The Australian HR tech market, which was estimated to be US$12 billion, has seen several players such as Culture Amp, Sourcr, Flare HR, MentorLoop, and Employment Innovations gain prominence in the past few years.
SEA potential expansion
With the pandemic pushing businesses to transition to full-time remote and hybrid working, Employment Hero sees potential for further expansion in Southeast Asia by the end of 2022, said Thompson. The company, however, didn‚Äôt share details of its expansion plans in the region, where it currently serves SMEs in Singapore and Malaysia.

This is understandable given the countless consumer-facing apps that offer convenient financial solutions and seem to be appearing from thin air.
Fintech is often seen as a recent marriage of financial services and IT.

Its sheer vastness also helps explain the flood of fintech news.

Premium summary
Vietnam‚Äôs fintech bulls

Image credit: Timmy Loen

Even without a clear legal framework guiding Vietnam‚Äôs fintech sector, investors remain bullish on its potential, pouring more than US$580 million into this space in 2021 alone. A major contributor was the country‚Äôs fintech darling, MoMo, which became a unicorn after its US$200 million series E round led by Japan‚Äôs Mizuho Bank in December 2021.


Origins of SEA‚Äôs next super app?: MoMo has cornered more than half the market share in Vietnam‚Äôs payments space and is now aiming to become a fintech super app, drawing from the strategies of WeChat and Alipay. To that end, MoMo has added financial services such as credit scoring, savings, and BNPL to its platform.


Deep-pocketed competition: Commercial banks and telecom operators have moved swiftly to offer digital financial products. In fact, most of their payment apps rank highly in both downloads and active users. Unlike fintech companies, which constantly have to raise funds, commercial banks have far greater resources. In 2021, two of Vietnam‚Äôs major commercial banks, Vietcombank and Techcombank, both hit the billion-dollar profit milestone.


Space to grow: Most users in Vietnam still haven‚Äôt used fintech platforms, apart from digital payment services, for their other financial needs. Additionally, a large chunk of the population remains outside the traditional banking system, leaving room for further disruption, especially in categories such as digital lending to individuals and small businesses.

BNPL‚Äôs latest ü¶Ñ

It seems the troubles of BNPL firms in Australia has done little to stop VC firms and other investors from pouring funds into these startups in Southeast Asia. BNPL in the region is still in its infancy, with the trend gaining significant momentum only in the past year. IPO-bound Akulaku has become the latest in the long line of Southeast Asia‚Äôs BNPL beneficiaries.


A coveted club: Akulaku has raised US$100 million in a series E round from Thailand-based Siam Commercial Bank. After the round, Akulaku‚Äôs valuation rose to between US$1.5 billion and US$2 billion, and the firm entered the unicorn club, a source close to the company told Tech in Asia. The company raised US$125 million in funding in 2021.


Meeting targets ‚úÖ: During the first half of 2021, the fintech firm posted a revenue of US$274 million, a 150% surge from the same period in 2020. The source added that the company had hit the US$600 million revenue mark in 2021, meeting its forecast. Half the startup‚Äôs revenue came from BNPL and the other half from cash loans.


An IPO in the offing?: Earlier this year, Indonesia-based Akulaku was reportedly in talks for a US listing this year via a merger with Catcha Investment Corp, a special purpose acquisition company set up by Patrick Grove, Catcha group‚Äôs co-founder. Akulaku is expected to raise between US$200 million and US$300 million in the process.

Seeds Capital also participated in the round, as part of a S$50 million (around US$37.2 million) co-investment scheme for maritime startups supported by Enterprise Singapore and the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore.

Founded in 2020, Riverr simplifies the verification of health data ‚Äì including vaccination history ‚Äì across organizations and governments. One way the platform can be used is in checking the health records of seafarers before they are approved for boarding or disembarking at ports.
In a statement, Riverr said that it can verify 10 standard health record data sets that are recognized worldwide. The company also said prominent health clinics and labs such as Acumen Diagnostics, Healthway Medical Group, and Mirxes have used its verification platform.
Riverr was founded by serial entrepreneur Kristina Lynge, along with Martin Nielsen and William Bech. The trio also built a maritime data collaboration platform called C-Log.
The startup plans to use the fresh funds to accelerate its partnership with healthcare providers in Singapore, the Philippines, India, and Indonesia.

Set up in 2007 by Michael Chew, Ava Insurance comprises Ava Insurance Brokers and Ava Insurance Agency. Following the acquisition, Ava‚Äôs operations will be integrated into Bolttech and will be supervised by Bolttech Singapore general manager Yen Yen Koh.
The insurtech startup said the change in ownership will not affect Ava‚Äôs service to its partners or customers.
Bolttech added that the acquisition will help accelerate the deployment of its insurance exchange in Singapore, which aims to make it easier for insurers, distributors, and customers to connect with each other. It is also looking to simplify the process of buying and selling insurance.
‚ÄúWe will continue to invest in Singapore, both as an international hub for innovation and as a market that presents Bolttech with significant opportunity to enhance the insurance experience for local customers and partners,‚Äù Bolttech group CEO Rob Schimek said in a statement.
The acquisition comes months after Bolttech completed its series A round, where it raised US$247 million. The round also saw participation from the likes of EDBI, a Singapore-based global investor.

732978,2022-02-16T07:00:22,Charting the growth of ID‚Äôs stock trading apps,"Welcome to The Top Up! Delivered every Wednesday via email and through the Tech in Asia website, this free newsletter breaks down the biggest stories and trends in fintech. If you‚Äôre not a subscriber, get access by registering here.
Hello there,
In Bahasa Indonesian, the word ajaib means magical or miraculous.
That may be why an Indonesian startup by the same name has achieved great feats in a short span of time.
Stock trading startup Ajaib became the country‚Äôs latest unicorn ‚Äî within just 2.5 years ‚Äî making it the second fastest to achieve the milestone after payments platform Ovo.
The venture capital world expects Ajaib to become as big as US-based Robinhood, one of the pioneers of online stock trading.
As Indonesia wakes up to the new hobby of stock trading via apps, several others apart from Ajaib have joined the rush to grab a piece of the flourishing market.
These include names such as Stockbit and Pluang, as well as Indonesia‚Äôs major banks and asset managers that offer apps alongside their in-house services.
While it‚Äôs worth noting that Indonesia‚Äôs 2.7 million stock investors make up only about 1% of the country‚Äôs population, the growing interest from the younger generation, especially millennials and Gen Z, is making it a hot industry.
In today‚Äôs big story, my colleague Jofie Yordan dives deep into the bullish world of Indonesia‚Äôs stock trading sector. Read on to know more.

THE BIG STORYAjaib, Stockbit drive Indonesia‚Äôs stock-trading boom

Ajaib, for one, became a unicorn in just 2.5 years. But rivals ‚Äì including more diversified newcomers ‚Äì are reaching for a slice of the pie.

THE HOT TAKEInvestor interest in Philippine fintech heats upHere‚Äôs what happened:

Singapore-headquartered Tonik, a neobank operating in the Philippines, raised US$131 million in a series B round 
Japanese megabank Mizuho led the round 
Tonik is one of six applicants that was granted a digital bank license in the Philippines 

Here‚Äôs our take:
Fintech investors in Southeast Asia look to Indonesia as a potential gold mine.
The problem is that the space is getting crowded ‚Äì there are at least 14 digital banks either in operation or awaiting a license to operate. The market is big enough to accommodate several players, but competition is likely to be intense.
Investors who cast their eyes across the sea will find that the Philippines, another Southeast Asian archipelago, has many of the same qualities that make Indonesia such an attractive market for fintech companies.

Both countries have large populations, many of whom remain unbanked or underbanked, with similar income levels, and room for greater urbanization that will drive demand for financial services.

Image credit: Timmy Loen

The digital banking opportunity in the Philippines may actually be superior to Indonesia because the country‚Äôs central bank, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, has capped the number of digibank licenses to six and will keep it there for now.
For companies like Tonik who have received a license, this gives them an advantage compared to financial service operators in Indonesia, where there is no such cap.
These strong macro tailwinds have become apparent in Tonik‚Äôs US$131 million round, which is large by Southeast Asian standards especially for a company still at an early stage of fundraising.
The investment is also a vote of confidence in Tonik‚Äôs CEO and founder, Greg Krasnov, who has experience with fintech in emerging markets. Notably, he founded Platinum Bank in Ukraine, which he led to an exit in 2014 for US$150 million, according to his LinkedIn profile.
But in 2017, Platinum Bank‚Äôs fortunes took a turn for the worse ‚Äì it was declared insolvent by the National Bank of Ukraine and shut its doors that year. We can assume that this was not an issue for investors in Tonik, who include big names like Sequoia and Point72, as well as Mizuho.
Tonik, which in December announced that it had attracted US$100 million in consumer deposits within eight months of its launch, will be competing against digital banks backed by some of the biggest names in the Philippines, including the Aboitiz and Gokongwei families and telecom giant PLDT.
How will Tonik, which doesn‚Äôt seem to have the same level of local backing, navigate a path forward? What unique advantages does it bring to the table? Will it aim to attract customers who are interested in higher-margin products like insurance and investments? These are some of the questions that need to be answered.

AmazingTalker runs a tutor-matching platform focused on language learning. Students can browse the company‚Äôs roster of instructors and choose one based on their preferences, though they can also opt to change to another teacher if they are not satisfied with the training they‚Äôve received.
The firm, which promises a better profit-sharing system for its instructors, also offers K-12 education services for children.
AmazingTalker co-founder and CEO Abner Chao told Tech in Asia that he started the platform in 2016 with an objective to make online English-language learning more accessible and to empower teachers to make more income from online lessons.
At the time, online programs for English cost up to 200,000 Taiwanese dollars (US$7,000), making them an unaffordable option for many people, he added.
Chao also pointed out that the online English learning market was then dominated by online education firm TutorABC, which set the fees that tutors could charge. Chao had previously worked at the company as a sales manager.
Over the years, AmazingTalker received a positive response, he said. To date, it has nearly 8,000 registered tutors and 1.1 million registered users and has clocked in 5.5 million online course reservations.

According to the CEO, Taiwan and Hong Kong cumulatively account for 60% of its total user base, though nearly 8% to 10% of users are from the US. The company is also witnessing an increasing number of students coming from China, Malaysia, and Singapore.
AmazingTalker plans to use the fresh capital to increase its team size ‚Äì it now has 110 employees spread across Taipei and Hong Kong ‚Äì and hire for product managers and developers specifically. The firm will also expand its business in Southeast Asia, Japan, Korea, Europe, and North America.
Chao said that the company will tailor its services to newer markets as well. For instance, in countries where English is the native language, AmazingTalker will focus on K-12 education. In non-English-speaking markets, it will continue to push its language-learning services.

732937,2022-02-16T05:00:15,Can Shopee win in India?,"In India, a black T-shirt from Shopee, the ecommerce arm of Southeast Asia‚Äôs internet giant Sea Group, can cost something like 149 rupees (US$1.98). But the array of discount vouchers and promotions on the platform can bring the price down significantly.

Photo credit: Shopee

The only drawback: Packages take over a week to be delivered, which is long considering ecommerce has entered the superfast lane all over the world.
But if Shopee targets customers who value money more than delivery speed, then it has a huge audience in India, Santosh Pai, partner at law firm Link Legal, tells Tech in Asia.
‚ÄúThere are millions of first-time customers in Tier 2 and Tier 3 who are willing to wait for 10 days for a parcel and save money with deep discounts that a platform like Shopee offers,‚Äù he points out.
The ecommerce giant entered India silently in November last year, without any big campaigns before its launch. That said, it definitely looks to be invested in the vast ecommerce opportunity in India.
According to a RedSeer report, the Covid-19 pandemic has added tailwinds to the country‚Äôs ecommerce sector, with the market opportunity likely to top US$140 billion by 2025.
And in 2020, for the first time in India, over 50% of online shoppers were from Tier 2 cities. This means ecommerce is increasingly reaching the length and breadth of India and is ripe for the taking by companies who can crack the country‚Äôs supply chain.
Shopee‚Äôs India plan
During Sea‚Äôs Q3 earnings call in November, group CEO Forest Li spoke about the ecommerce firm‚Äôs expansion plans, including in India.
‚ÄúFrom time to time, we may test the waters in new markets where we believe there may be an opportunity to use our experience in a highly diverse environment to reach underserved buyers and sellers,‚Äù he said at the time.
However, Shopee‚Äôs India initiative seems to go beyond just testing the waters.
Quickly after its rollout in November last year, the Shopee app has seen over 20 million downloads in India, according to Sensor Tower data. For perspective, local ecommerce firms Meesho and Flipkart netted over 160 million and 115 million downloads in 2021, respectively.
However, according to App Annie data, Shopee was the second most downloaded shopping app in India for the months of December 2021 and January 2022, coming in just after Meesho.
Ôªø

Shopee is also charging zero commissions from merchants in India for now, which would undoubtedly attract more sellers on the app. As of January, the platform already has over 20,000 sellers in India. This, of course, may change over time, as Shopee currently charges 12% to 18% commissions in Brazil, a country it has already made its mark on.
The ecommerce titan has a strong track record in applying its playbook in ASEAN and Brazil as well, and it wouldn‚Äôt be a stretch to say that it may be applying the same game plan in India, assuming that the company has long-term aspirations in the country.

Shopee has not responded to an email sent by Tech in Asia seeking details of its India strategy.
In only a year, the company stepped up local hiring efforts in Brazil and formed a team of 250 people while working with local sellers.
In India, where it has only been operational for a few months, the company already has a team of 300 people and has hired a head of operations in the country. It has nearly 30,000 employees globally as of now.
The company currently has over 60 openings for its India business on LinkedIn, mostly for seller communications, business management, and campaign management roles.
On the logistics side, Shopee is likely to continue to partner with third-party logistics service providers to serve seller and buyer communities.

Moving forward, Shopee‚Äôs India app will offer a mix of community buying experiences, livestreaming, and video content features, a source with direct knowledge of the matter tells Tech in Asia. Advertising is another frontier that could help Shopee garner success in India. Ecommerce platforms typically possess large amounts of data on consumers, so advertisers would have no problem leveraging this data to target users.
See also: Sea: The next advertising powerhouse?
The app is already allowing buyers to directly chat with sellers on the platform, and it‚Äôs been experimenting with daily promotions, deep discounts, free shipping and cashback offers in India.
Shopee vs. Amazon India?
Despite Shopee‚Äôs early wins in India, its larger goals are still unclear. According to Sutradhar co-founder and former Forrester senior forecast analyst Satish Meena, Shopee is here to capture the untapped ecommerce market that Amazon and Flipkart, the two biggest ecommerce players in the country, have so far not been able to breach.
‚ÄúShopee is not here to compete with Flipkart or Amazon. They are here to attract new customers who are coming online for the first time and are looking to make small ticket-size purchases,‚Äù Meena tells Tech in Asia.
Currently, India has the third-largest online shopper pool in the world ‚Äì roughly 150 million people ‚Äì after the US and China. This user base is expected to swell to 500 million by 2030, according to a report.
If its goal is truly to capture first-time users, Shopee‚Äôs nearest competitors would be companies like social commerce platform Meesho and ecommerce player Snapdeal, which are tapping into the aspirations of people in Tier 2 and Tier 3 towns, Meena adds. Both Snapdeal and Meesho target price-sensitive customers and sell lesser-known brands in categories such as home, apparel, and beauty.

Meesho office / Photo credit: Meesho

The two firms also give importance to regional languages when reaching out to non-English-speaking customers.
Currently, 83% of Snapdeal users prefer Hindi while talking to customer services agents, and 14% choose a vernacular language. Shopee is currently available in Hindi and English in India.
Snapdeal, meanwhile, already sees more than 80% of its transactions come from small towns. For Meesho, more than 70% of its new customers hail from Tier 3 areas.
Interestingly, a MoneyControl report published in November last year pointed out that Meesho clocks in 2 million orders per day, while both Amazon and Flipkart combined serve 2.5 million daily orders. Companies like Meesho have tie-ups with almost all the biggest logistics networks in India, who value the volume of products more than their price tag, which could be key to how the firm handles the large volume of parcels ordered on its platform, the report noted.
While Shopee doesn‚Äôt have a first-mover advantage in India, it has strong experience in dealing with users who shop on smartphones in Southeast Asia. This will help it build its case in India, where smartphones have reached over 700 million people.
Bumps on the road
While Shopee has garnered a large following in India in a short span of time, its cart is filling up with controversies.
Free Fire, a game produced by Sea Group gaming arm Garena that has an immense fan following in India, has just been banned by the government. It‚Äôs one of 53 other ‚ÄúChina-linked‚Äù apps that have recently been blocked.
By this logic, even Shopee could come under the ban radar of the Indian government.
Another MoneyControl report said that Garena is working to address the situation. Shopee has not responded to an email sent by Tech in Asia asking whether it is concerned about its expansion plans in the country.
This is not the first time Sea‚Äôs business units have been questioned in India. In December last year, the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), a trade body in the country, also alleged that Shopee has Chinese roots, which violates the country‚Äôs foreign direct investment rules. It has sought a ban on the ecommerce platform and even highlighted that group CEO Li was born in China.
Another bone of contention for the trade body is that Chinese conglomerate Tencent holds a stake in Sea. It is worth mentioning that Tencent is also a shareholder in several Indian startups including Flipkart, Byju‚Äôs, Swiggy, Udaan, and Ola.
CAIT has in the past targeted ‚Äúforeign companies‚Äù such as Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart for engaging in ‚Äúunethical practice‚Äù in India. It even organized an ecommerce purification week in June last year, aimed at setting up a monitoring mechanism for ecommerce trade. But none of these complaints have really had much of an impact on the operations or businesses of these ecommerce companies.

A screenshot of the Shopee India website

Earlier in January, Tencent cut its stake in Sea Group from 21.3% to 18.7%, which some say is a step to water down further China-related issues in India.
One of Shopee‚Äôs other complaints comes from a customer in the state of Uttar Pradesh, who had filed a first information report¬†with the police against the company for selling counterfeit products. When Tech in Asia checked, it found several products labeled as Gucci and Prada were being sold for bargain-basement prices, which were later removed from the app. The Shopee app has also been named on the US Trade Representatives‚Äô Notorious Markets for Counterfeiting and Piracy 2021 list.
The issue of fakes isn‚Äôt unique to Shopee. Recently, a case was also lodged against Amazon India for selling fake ayurvedic products of a particular brand.
Shopee is looking to hire a dedicated person to track fraudulent activities on the app. This could bolster its Shopee Guarantee feature, which withholds payment to sellers until consumers are satisfied with a purchase.
CAIT has also knocked on the doors of the country‚Äôs regulatory watchdog, the Competition Commission of India, claiming that Shopee is allegedly involved in predatory pricing and negatively affecting the marketplace. The ecommerce company has already faced such scrutiny in Malaysia, the Philippines, and Indonesia.

But one cannot ignore the fact that Shopee also has operational experience from several countries. ‚ÄúSo they can easily take care of these regulatory issues if they want to play long in India,‚Äù says Meena.

732638,2022-02-16T04:00:44,Singapore is opening the doors to Southeast Asian tech expansion,"Southeast Asia‚Äôs tech scene isn‚Äôt the wild west it used to be. Maturing markets, repeat founders, and a digital-savvy customer base are transforming the region into a global hub for innovation.
Despite last year‚Äôs upheavals, Southeast Asian startups raised over US$8.2 billion in capital, and they are predicted to achieve a combined value of US$1 trillion by 2025.
For Sukumar Suresh, regional vice president of Singapore‚Äôs Economic Development Board (EDB), the 649 million digitally-dominant Southeast Asians and the region‚Äôs nascent infrastructure are driving an ‚Äúunprecedented boom‚Äù for startups in the ecommerce, financial services, healthcare, and education sectors.
Opportunity knocks as SEA markets mature
Unlike more mature markets like China and the US, processes and infrastructure in Southeast Asia are not as defined, leaving plenty of room for startups to experiment and innovate with new solutions tailored to each market.
For example, travel startup Traveloka expanded its range of payment solutions to include cash and buy now, pay later options to support Southeast Asia‚Äôs significant unbanked population.
Kelvin Teo, the co-founder and director of alternative investment platform Funding Societies, notes that though Southeast Asian customers are sophisticated internet users, the markets themselves aren‚Äôt as competitive as their more established Western counterparts. This, along with the large number of digitally dominant customer bases, presents significant opportunities for fast-growth tech startups.

‚ÄúAs tech often entails change and at times disruption, a good tech hub has to serve as a testbed for innovation and provide a stable base for production and expansion,‚Äù he says.
Differences divide the region
Despite the promise Southeast Asia holds for companies looking to expand, startups still have to grapple with pain points, many of which can be seen throughout the region‚Äôs various ecosystems.
Willson Cuaca, co-founder and managing partner of investment firm East Ventures, says the shortage of tech talent is one of the major hurdles that startups face, especially for foreign firms looking to expand into Southeast Asia. It‚Äôs estimated that by 2030, Asia Pacific will be short of the 47 million tech talents needed to meet growing demand.
‚Äú[The problem] is particularly acute for a rising tech ecosystem like Southeast Asia, where the local talent supply is far from sufficient,‚Äù Teo adds. ‚ÄúIt takes more convincing to attract foreign talents to our shores, pushing salaries to exorbitant levels ‚Äì but then the environment is not conducive for them to stay and naturalize in the long-term, resulting in a leaky bucket problem.‚Äù
Each country is unique and startups need to build a platform that is common for all yet flexible to hyperlocal wisdom.
Another issue for companies looking to expand in Southeast Asia is the fragmentation and diversity of the region‚Äôs markets.
‚ÄúEach of Southeast Asia‚Äôs 11 countries has a different regulatory, economic, and social environment,‚Äù says Teo. ‚ÄúTech firms have to choose between concentration risk in a bigger country and the pains of entering multiple distinct markets ‚Äì many choose somewhere in between.‚Äù
For Cuaca, what‚Äôs important is that startups figure out early on who their target audiences are. ‚ÄúEach country is unique and startups need to build a platform that is common for all yet flexible to hyperlocal wisdom,‚Äù he explains.
Singapore rising
Despite the relatively small size of its market, Teo says Singapore acts as an ideal ‚Äúwarm up‚Äù for cross-regional expansion because of its international reputation and government initiatives to cultivate investment, talent, and connections.
‚ÄúWhile Singapore doesn‚Äôt share the same attitude toward entrepreneurship risk as Tel Aviv, the tech ecosystem in Singapore is unique thanks to strategic state intervention and its position between East and West,‚Äù he says, referencing the government‚Äôs concerted effort to foster tech innovation through infrastructure, funding, and community building.
According to Suresh, the island nation is home to over 600 investors and 200 accelerators and incubators, not to mention various state and government-linked initiatives.
For example, state-linked investment company Temasek has become an active champion of deep tech startups, having recently announced an annual US$738 million commitment to deep tech startups. The commitment follows on the government‚Äôs plan to spend US$18.4 billion over five years on technology-related research and development.
Streamlining for business-friendliness
Funding aside, Singapore is also a conducive environment for startups looking for a gateway to the rest of Southeast Asia. The country has consistently ranked as one of the best in terms of ease of doing business because of access to talent and business-friendly regulations.
Cuaca says that Singapore‚Äôs government has been especially progressive in helping startups find connections to not just funding, but also global partners and tech talent. In 2021, EDB‚Äôs investment arm helped 25 startups raise US$216 million in funding from private investors.

Furthermore, major events like AsiaTechX Singapore and SFFxSWITCH, as well as government-led initiatives like the Global Innovation Alliance, Digital Economy Agreements, and Open Innovation Network, help connect local Singaporean startups to global tech communities.
Suresh points out that ‚Äã‚Äãthe country‚Äôs progressive approach to regulation has promoted strong partnerships between government and business.
‚ÄúSingapore takes a different approach by working closely together with tech companies to develop and test new technologies that may not be ready for the real world,‚Äù he says. Suresh brings up the example of how the local authorities collaborated with Grab and nuTonomy to test out the world‚Äôs first driverless taxi on public roads.
The country‚Äôs wellspring of businesses has naturally made it attractive to talent from all over the world. Teo says that for startups, the availability of skilled workers makes Singapore an important place to be in, especially as he predicts talent competition will ‚Äúevolve into a fully-fledged war.‚Äù
‚ÄúAs big tech firms set up regional headquarters and scale up their tech hiring, the pinch in talent will be more acutely felt by smaller tech firms and might hurt the long-term vibrancy of the tech ecosystem,‚Äù he adds.
However, Teo says the government‚Äôs efforts to cultivate tech talent through educational institutions like the National University of Singapore‚Äôs Overseas College and upskilling programs like SkillsFuture is one step in the right direction.
Singapore has also teamed up with countries in the region to develop partnerships that provide companies with a steady pipeline of tech talent. Suresh brings up the example of Nongsa Digital Park (NDP), a Batam-based tech hub that trains and hires Indonesian tech talent to complement and support the operations of Singapore-based companies as part of a holistic and integrated regional tech strategy. NDP also serves as a ‚Äúdigital bridge‚Äù between Indonesia and Singapore enabling companies from both countries to collaborate and innovate to achieve mutually beneficial outcomes.
The momentum keeps going
From Suresh‚Äôs perspective, Singapore could be a ‚Äútech innovation flywheel‚Äù that can serve both local startups looking to scale and commercialize their business as well as established firms that see the bigger potential of the greater Southeast Asia region.

Cuaca says that though most countries in Southeast Asia are still playing catch-up due to the newness of the digital economy, it‚Äôs important that governments and the private sector keep talking and moving forward together in the same rhythm.
‚ÄúFortunately, many governments are aware of the challenges, and have demonstrated exceptional willingness to engage the industry and work to provide expansion solutions,‚Äù Teo adds. ‚ÄúMore has to be done in providing expansion solutions and governments have been a meaningful part of that, but the key is upkeep.‚Äù

Singapore‚Äôs Economic Development Board (EDB), a government agency under the Ministry of Trade and Industry, is working to build up the country‚Äôs tech ecosystem to support companies looking to reap the rewards of Southeast Asia‚Äôs digital potential.

733027,2022-02-16T03:42:53,Exclusive: India‚Äôs Goqii bags $50m series C money for SEA launch,"Goqii, a tech-enabled healthcare platform based in India, told Tech in Asia that it has raised US$50 million in a series C round led by Sumeru Ventures, a global VC firm.
Other participants in the round include Modality, 9Unicorns, Venture Catalysts, Mitsui, The Times Group, and Ascendo, as well as a clutch of angel investors.
The fundraise also includes venture debt funding, which was led by Blacksoil Capital and Trifecta Capital.

Goqii, which is also backed by Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma and Tata Group chairman emeritus Ratan Tata, last raised an undisclosed sum in November 2018 in a round led by Mitsui.
The startup offers a wide range of health-focused services that include wearable fitness bands, personalized remote coaching, and diagnostics.
Goqii was founded in 2014 by Vishal Gondal, who previously served as a managing director at The Walt Disney Company. His first startup, IndiaGames, was acquired in 2012 by DisneyUTV Digital, a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company India. He is also a well-known angel investor in the Indian startup space.
SEA expansion on the cards
Gondal told Tech in Asia that the company will soon enter the Southeast Asian market. It plans to start offering its services through local partnerships in Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia by the end of the year.
Outside Southeast Asia, Goqii is eyeing Japan and the US.
Gondal revealed that the company‚Äôs strategy will be to identify partners ‚Äì which could be insurance, healthcare, or independent service providers ‚Äì to roll out in the markets mentioned above. He added that the company will also tailor its solutions for these markets.
Goqii is banking on its deep experience in the healthcare space as its target markets have demographics facing lifestyle-related health issues such as diabetes.
It is worth noting that Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia all have sizable healthcare industries. The healthcare market in Singapore is expected to grow to US$49.4 billion by 2029. Meanwhile, the healthcare industries of Indonesia and Malaysia generated revenues worth US$41.2 billion and US$14 billion, respectively, in 2020.

Insuring faster growth
Gondal described the Covid-19 pandemic as the demonetization moment, wherein the Indian government‚Äôs order to ban currency notes with denominations of 500 rupees and 1,000 rupees led to an exponential growth of digital payments in the country.
The pandemic has also led to a huge demand for digital health services and solutions. Factors such as healthcare awareness, easier access to insurance, and rising incomes are seen to drive India‚Äôs healthcare market to hit US$372 billion by 2022, according to a KPMG report.
The last couple of years have seen several landmark deals in the Indian healthtech space. PharmEasy, a six-year-old startup, paid US$613 million to acquire a 66.1% stake in Thyrocare Technologies, one of the country‚Äôs largest diagnostics laboratory chains. Tata Digital acquired online pharmacy 1mg in June last year. Temasek and Zomato-backed fitness firm Curefit recently raised US$145 million in a series F round.

The heightened competition may point to why Goqii is doubling down on verticals like insurance with the new funding.
The company has come up with an ‚Äúoutcome-based insurance‚Äù service, which leverages data from its solutions to help provide a relevant insurance plan. The company has already partnered with insurance service providers such as Max Bupa and Bajaj Allianz.
It‚Äôs worth noting that India‚Äôs insurance market hit US$280 billion in 2020 and is projected to grow at a rate of up to 15% annually by 2023.
Goqii‚Äôs larger picture is a 360-degree approach to healthcare, where it will provide a combination of multiple health-focused services such as disease management and remote coaching, among others.
However, Gondal does not believe that Goqii is turning into a health-focused super app, explaining that the company is focused on the preventive healthcare space. Taking a critical view of the super-app concept, he said that some players are building such platforms because they do not have a particular use case and therefore offer everything under a single roof to keep users engaged daily.
That is not the case with Goqii, he added.

Getting fit for an IPO
Gondal revealed that the company‚Äôs revenue had increased by 250% since the start of the pandemic. He added that the company also saw an upward trajectory in other metrics such as average selling price per user, which grew 40% in the same period.
Goqii aims to have 2 million monthly active users by the end of 2022 and 5 million in the next three years. The platform currently has nearly 800,000 monthly active users.
Gondal pointed out that the company‚Äôs user base consists solely of paid users as it does not have a free model. Goqii offers its services through a subscription model, with prices starting at 1,599 rupees (US$21).
The company is also targeting US$100 million in revenue in the next 18 to 24 months. Goqii says that over the last few years, it has been seeing a compound annual growth rate of 100%, and it is expecting similar fast-paced growth for the next few years.
The healthtech firm also has plans to go public ‚Äì while the timeline is not finalized, Gondal expects an IPO to happen in the next 18 months. He said the company is keeping all options open, whether it is to list in India or overseas via a special purpose acquisition company vehicle. Goqii is also considering inorganic growth via mergers and acquisitions.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre working on a strategy, but we are not looking to roll up random companies,‚Äù Gondal added.
With its good financial health and ambitious expansion plans, Goqii appears confident about the road ahead. While its entry to Southeast Asia may give it a big boost, a lot will ride on how the firm implements its local partnerships and meets its ambitious targets.

At the same time, the company received US$150 million in debt financing from institutional lenders from Europe, Asia, and the US.

Founded by Kelvin Teo and Reynold Wijaya in 2015, Funding Societies is a lending company that can disburse anywhere from US$500 to US$1.5 million in loans to micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises¬†in Southeast Asia. It currently operates in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam, as well as in Indonesia under the name Modalku.
Since its establishment, Funding Societies has disbursed more than US$2 billion through 4.9 million loan transactions.
The company aims to use the fresh funding to offer other financial services besides lending as well as to expand to new markets in Southeast Asia. It also plans to provide a US$16 million ESOP buyback program for both former and existing employees who meet eligibility requirements.
Between 2020 and 2021, the company raised a total of US$45 million in its series C funding round.

Founded in 2016, FindMyAdventure specializes in adventure tours and works with more than 150 tour operators in Pakistan.
In a statement, GoZayaan said that one of the primary reasons for acquiring FindMyAdventure was the similarities between Bangladesh and Pakistan in terms of geography, internet penetration, and travel landscape.
‚ÄúThis arrangement also supports the collective ability of FindMyAdventure and GoZayaan to improve the region‚Äôs travel and tourism infrastructure with rapid technology adoption and improved access to travel,‚Äù the company added.
The deal comes after GoZayaan raised an undisclosed sum in January from Nordstar Partners, DST Global Partner Saurabh Gupta, and Payback founder Alexander Rittweger.
In September 2021, GoZayaan got US$2.6 million in a seed round led by Wavemaker Partners. Other investors included Ratio Ventures, 1982 VC, Iterative, and Century Oak Capital. Prior to this, the firm raised an undisclosed sum in a pre-seed round from Brac Osiris Impact Ventures.
GoZayaan was founded in 2017 by Ridwan Hafiz, co-founder of Bangladesh-based digital marketing agency Analyzen.

732882,2022-02-16T01:55:28,"Ajaib, Stockbit drive Indonesia‚Äôs stock-trading boom","Amid the pandemic, stock trading has become a favorite pastime in many countries, and Indonesia is no exception. By June 2020, the country had 1.2 million retail investors ‚Äì a 12% rise from six months earlier.
That inflow of new investors has lifted the country‚Äôs stock-trading apps to new heights. Stockbit, for instance, was valued at US$10.8 million in Q4 2019, according to data from VentureCap Insights. By Q2 2021, it was valued at US$347 million, following a series D round.
Ajaib, one of Stockbit‚Äôs competitors, has gone a step further, becoming one of Indonesia‚Äôs latest unicorns.
Perhaps more impressively, Ajaib has done so in only two and a half years. Among Indonesia‚Äôs unicorns, only Ovo has reached the milestone quicker.

‚ÄúTo date, the app has more than 1 million investors, dominated by the younger generation, especially millennials and Gen Z,‚Äù a source close to Ajaib tells Tech in Asia.
The size of Stockbit‚Äôs user base is also similar, a spokesperson confirms. That said, Stockbit has an additional 2 million users through Bibit, the mutual funds robo adviser it acquired in 2019.
If the trajectory of US-based stock-trading app Robinhood ‚Äì which went public in 2021 at a valuation of US$32 billion ‚Äì is anything to go by, there may be good reason for bullishness around its Indoneasian counterparts.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not impossible that Ajaib will become as big as Robinhood within a short time,‚Äù Chandra Tjan, partner at Alpha JWC Ventures, previously told Tech in Asia.

Ajaib founders Anderson Sumarli (left) and Yada Piyajomkwan / Photo credit: Ajaib

But Ajaib and Stockbit are hardly the only players in this space. Indonesia‚Äôs major banks and asset managers also offer apps besides their in-house services. Meanwhile, there are newer players like Pluang, which offers multiple products (including cryptocurrency) via a single app.
‚ÄúCompetition in this vertical is still at an early stage,‚Äù notes Melisa Irene, partner at Stockbit backer East Ventures. ‚ÄúOpportunities are still wide open for potential new players.‚Äù
Battling the establishment
Perhaps what‚Äôs most impressive is how quickly these apps have grown.
Stockbit, for instance, saw its valuation climb over 30x in just a year and a half to US$10.8 million in Q4 2019. Ajaib, meanwhile, has raised a total of US$245 million in disclosed funding ‚Äì 90% of that was raised entirely in 2021, spread across three different rounds.

‚ÄúWe conducted experiments in 2019, finding product-market fit in 2020, and hyperscaled in 2021,‚Äù Anderson Sumarli, Ajaib‚Äôs co-founder and CEO, wrote on LinkedIn.
While the pandemic has played a pivotal role behind the rise of these apps, East Ventures‚Äô Irene believes this is a long-term trend.
She says there are many factors behind the trend, including increased financial literacy among the general public and online platforms themselves. Also, Indonesia‚Äôs millennials and Gen Z ‚Äì the main target markets of both Ajaib and Stockbit ‚Äì now make up the majority of Indonesia‚Äôs population.
Zuhdi Ahmad, a retail investor and Ajaib user, hails the app‚Äôs ‚Äúeasy‚Äù user experience, precisely because it is geared toward millennials.
From a marketing standpoint, Ajaib‚Äôs education among younger users is ‚Äúvery relevant‚Äù to how they view stock trading, he explains. ‚ÄúInitially, the stock market was such a foreign world,‚Äù he points out.

Photo credit: Ajaib

But these new platforms face stiff competition from established players like Indonesia‚Äôs big banks and asset management firms. Bank Mandiri and Bank Central Asia ‚Äì two of Indonesia‚Äôs biggest banks by assets ‚Äì have launched apps to supplement their long-running investment businesses, as have more specialized firms like South Korea‚Äôs Mirae Asset.
One such player is asset manager Indo Premier Sekuritas (IPOT). Its customers previously transacted via desktops, but the company launched an app in 2020 to tap into the wave of new users.
Unlike its ‚Äúestablishment‚Äù peers, IPOT‚Äôs app has managed to gain over 1 million active users to become a rival to up-and-coming startups.
However, third-party estimates show that, apart from IPOT, these apps have relatively smaller user bases compared with Ajaib‚Äôs or Stockbit‚Äôs.
But that may be because they are older users with long-standing relationships with banks and their brokers ‚Äì as well as with larger investment sums.

‚ÄúThese services are what my bosses used,‚Äù Ahmad says. ‚ÄúEspecially once you have several billion rupiah in management, you typically do business through your broker.‚Äù
Ahmad himself uses both Ajaib and BCA Sekuritas, the investment arm of Indonesia‚Äôs largest private bank. He uses Ajaib for short-term investments ‚Äì a mixture of blue-chip and penny stocks ‚Äì and for learning technical analysis.
His investments through BCA, on the other hand, are ‚Äúlow risk, low return‚Äù blue-chip stocks that he plans to hold for 10 years or more.
Expanding into crypto?
Still, simplicity is important when targeting first-time retail investors, and Ajaib and Stockbit have had to forgo certain features offered by the banks. Ahmad, for instance, uses specialized stock analysis apps such as RTI Business to plan his investments, as they provide more data than Ajaib.
Dewi Rachmat, a former business journalist and a retail investor, agrees that Ajaib‚Äôs analysis is not as detailed as that of¬†Mandiri Online Securities Trading (MOST). But that may not be a big issue.
‚ÄúWhile apps like MOST are better in providing more detailed analyses, this new crop of retail investors may not really need it,‚Äù she explains. ‚ÄúThey can find analyses in other sources, such as online content‚Äù on platforms like Telegram.
There‚Äôs also value in acquiring younger users now, as they will have rising incomes and make larger investments as they get older.
‚ÄúThe success of an investment startup will depend on its ability to build a user community so that it creates a sticky or loyalty effect,‚Äù adds East Ventures‚Äô Irene.
Of course, it‚Äôs still early days, and the bigger threat for Ajaib or Stockbit may come from other startups.
Investment in cryptocurrencies is enjoying its moment in the sun as apps like TokoCrypto or Indodax draw similar ‚Äì or even higher ‚Äì active user counts as stock-trading apps, according to third-party estimates.

New players like Pluang, which bills itself as an ‚Äúall-in-one‚Äù investment app, have enjoyed decent momentum of late. While Pluang currently does not let users trade on the Indonesia Stock Exchange, it lets them invest in assets like gold, US stocks, and cryptocurrency.
It‚Äôs not clear whether Ajaib or Stockbit plan to incorporate cryptocurrency into their offerings. However, it is a path that Robinhood has recently taken ‚Äì the US company claims its global expansion will be ‚Äúcrypto-first‚Äù.
For Ajaib at least, taking that step wouldn‚Äôt be that much of a stretch, especially since it shares an investor ‚Äì Ribbit Capital ‚Äì with Robinhood and Coinbase.
But for now, Ajaib has set its sights on another popular sector: digital banks. The company has invested US$52 million in Bank Bumi Arta, and likely plans to convert it into a digibank.
Ultimately, it‚Äôs worth noting that Indonesia‚Äôs 2.7 million stock investors make up only about 1% of the country‚Äôs population.
‚ÄúEven though it has grown, the proportion of Indonesian retail investors compared to its productive population is still far below neighbors like Singapore and Malaysia,‚Äù says a Stockbit spokesperson. ‚ÄúThe potential is huge.‚Äù",Jofie Yordan,Putra Muskita and Arpit Nayak,0,"['Analysis', 'Fintech', 'Premium Content']",True,True,5

732682,2022-02-15T13:00:32,"Ex-Grab, Googlers‚Äô GameFi firm looks to bring play-to-earn to the masses","Southeast Asia‚Äôs GameFi sector lit up the stage last year, with titles like Axie Infinity and blockchain gaming guilds like Yield Guild Games raising massive rounds. Toward the end of 2021, four experienced tech veterans from Google, Microsoft, Airbnb, and Grab were cooking up their own GameFi platform.
Singapore-based Ethlas announced today that it has secured US$2.7 million in seed funding from Sequoia Capital India, Yield Guild Games Southeast Asia, Global Blockchain Innovative Capital, and a host of other backers.

Demystifying blockchain gaming
Launched in November last year, Ethlas operates a free-to-play and play-to-earn (P2E) blockchain-based game metaverse built on the Polygon chain. According to the company‚Äôs website, the games it offers play similar to already popular mobile games like 2048, Candy Crush, and¬†Tetris.
Ethlas‚Äô founders came up with the idea to launch the startup when they found that Filipinos have been earning more from playing P2E games compared to their day jobs.
‚ÄúEthlas is a game aggregator ‚Äì on one hand onboarding early players onto blockchain, but also appealing to the game studios to list their games on the site,‚Äù Elston Sam, co-founder of Ethlas, told¬†Tech in Asia.¬†The company said it‚Äôs currently working with game studios to launch their titles on Ethlas under a revenue-sharing model.

Ethlas co-founder Elston Sam / Photo credit: Ethlas

Sam established Ethlas alongside three other co-founders, including US-based Gennady Medvinsky. Before Ethlas, Medvinsky built products and platforms for companies such as Microsoft, Grab, and Google. The two other co-founders are currently in stealth mode.
They currently lead a team of 22 blockchain engineers, game developers, data scientists, cybersecurity experts, and designers who are based in Singapore, the US, and the Philippines. Ethlas plans to ‚Äúaggressively‚Äù hire more as it builds out its platform in the coming months.
To start playing on Ethlas, users only need to install or link their existing crypto wallets. These games can also be played on a PC or a mobile phone‚Äôs browser.
This is in contrast to most GameFi platforms that require subscription fees or upfront capital. For Axie Infinity, a good team could cost upwards of US$1,000.
‚ÄúOne key product metric we anchor on is that it takes two minutes for a user landing for the first time on our website to the point they are playing their first game and having fun ‚Äì no download hassle, crazy registration flow, paywall, or complex game mechanics,‚Äù Sam shared.

Ethlas to the moon
Within 14 weeks of its launch, the company said it saw over 120,000 unique crypto wallets onboard its platform. This already puts it ahead of 90% of the existing GameFi titles, according to Sam.
The number, however, is light-years away from Ethlas‚Äô moonshot vision of one billion players.
Sam said that the number of blockchain gamers right now is in the single-digit millions, while casual gamers top out at around 2.5 billion. ‚ÄúBy combining strong and growing consumer demand for crypto or blockchain, and the expanding reach of casual games, Ethlas is aptly positioned to be at the intersection of the mass adoption of Web3,‚Äù he added.

Ethlas said it also plans to work with regulators on a framework for GameFi, as the company believes that regulations and consumer education are two key factors for blockchain gaming‚Äôs entry into the mainstream.
Bringing its vision a bit closer to Earth‚Äôs atmosphere, Sam said that the company aims to have 10 million active users by the end of the year. The co-founder also believes that the launch of its first series of NFTs, called Komos, will help drive both user and revenue growth.

Modeled after the Komodo Dragons of Indonesia, Komos will allow gamers on Ethlas‚Äô platform to boost their gameplay and gain more XGEMs (Exchange Genesis Ethlas Medium), the in-game cryptocurrency of its metaverse. Like other NFTs, Komos are unique in that they have different sets of traits like fangs, horns, eyes, and skin color.
‚ÄúThe unique value proposition of Komo NFTs is that they do not only function as game passes on Ethlas, granting players special access to games and features. They are also asset-backed NFTs,‚Äù explained Sam, adding that the NFT will have both artistic and monetary value.
However, one challenge Sam sees is how Ethlas can balance catering its offerings to free-to-play players new to the GameFi scene and crypto natives focused on the big financial returns they‚Äôre accustomed to.
‚ÄúOur job is to balance the needs of these two constituents with that of game studios and create a thriving marketplace,‚Äù Sam said. ‚ÄúThe good news is that the founding team have all been marketplace builders in their past lives, so they know how to crack this puzzle to attract the next billion users into the Ethlas Metaverse.‚Äù",Miguel Cordon,Collin Furtado and Lorenzo Kyle Subido,0,"['Blockchain', 'Gaming', 'Investments', 'News', 'Premium Content']",True,True,4

PropertyGuru announced its intention to list in the US last year.¬†At the time, the agreement gave PropertyGuru an enterprise value of roughly US$1.35 billion and an equity value of about US$1.78 billion.

More and more celebrities are getting into the NFT craze, including the likes of footballer Lionel Messi and Canadian pop artist Justin Bieber. It‚Äôs no different in India ‚Äì actor Amitabh Bachchan sold a recital of his late father‚Äôs poem, Madhushala, as well as some autographed posters and other memorabilia on NFT marketplace BeyondLife.
Big names, big money.


A myriad of offerings: WazirX, BeyondLife Club, Ikonz, BollyCoin, and Social Swag are just a few of the startups that have thrown their hats into the ring. Even media conglomerates like Viacom18 have joined the NFT bandwagon.


No ban, just high taxes: On February 1, the country‚Äôs finance minister announced a 30% tax on gains from crypto-related assets. While enthusiasts bemoaned the steep taxes, the announcement put talks of a possible crypto-related ban to rest.


Alternative investment avenue: Youngsters in Tier 2 and Tier 3 towns increasingly have more spending power, but traditional investment opportunities like real estate, stocks, and fixed deposits don‚Äôt hold the appeal they once used to. NFTs are an attractive alternative.

685780,2022-02-15T05:00:40,The key players in Vietnam‚Äôs fintech battleground,"This is the latest version of the article that was published on July 13, 2021.

MoMo‚Äôs new headquarters occupies three floors at Phu My Hung Tower in District 7, an upscale area of Ho Chi Minh City. The fintech firm is Vietnam‚Äôs latest unicorn after its US$200 million series E round led by Japan‚Äôs Mizuho Bank, which was announced in December 2021. The fancy office signifies MoMo‚Äôs dramatic growth from a SIM card-based digital wallet to a payment app reaching 31 million users.

MoMo‚Äôs new headquarters in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam / Photo credit: MoMo

MoMo has cornered more than half of the market share in Vietnam‚Äôs digital wallet space. The company is targeting to become a fintech super app, mirroring the strategies of WeChat and Alipay. To that end, MoMo has added financial services such as credit scoring, savings, and buy now, pay later (BNPL) onto its platform.


The pandemic has accelerated adoption of digital payment services in the country, with the State Bank of Vietnam estimating that mobile wallet transaction value reached nearly US$15 billion in 2020. However, the majority of users still haven‚Äôt used fintech platforms for their other financial needs.
As such, digital payment companies like MoMo must diversify their offerings and tap into underserved segments.¬†These companies should expect intense competition from niche players like Timo (digital banking), Infina and Anfin (investment apps), F88 (digital lending), and a host of BNPL and insurtech startups.
In addition, commercial banks and telecom operators have swiftly moved to offer digital financial products. In fact, most of their payment apps rank highly in both downloads and active users.

Unlike fintech companies that constantly have to raise funds, commercial banks have far deeper resources. In 2021, two of Vietnam‚Äôs major commercial banks, Vietcombank and Techcombank, both achieved the billion-dollar profit milestone. Banks have also started offering zero-fee policies for selected features to lure back customers from fintech platforms.
Still, a large chunk of the population remains outside the traditional banking system, leaving room for further disruption, especially in categories such as digital lending for individuals and small businesses.

Even without a clear legal framework guiding the sector, investors remain bullish on the country‚Äôs fintech potential. They have invested more than US$580 million in 2021 alone. For this report, we have excluded crypto and blockchain players as the explosive growth of the sector requires a separate analysis.
Here‚Äôs a look at how funding in the space has been going lately:

Here are the details on the funding rounds that we‚Äôve tracked:

We hope that as we constantly update our database, this will be a useful reference for anyone who‚Äôs interested in Vietnam‚Äôs fintech space.

Lamuda said his experience from building Berrybenka over eight years ago had placed Grow Commerce in a ‚Äúunique position.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe have grown our own online platform, built a network of offline stores, and expanded in various online marketplaces. We understand many of the pain points and the needs from a brand owner perspective,‚Äù he said.

Hello reader,
Remember when teenagers ruled social media and adults always bemoaned how it was a waste of time? Last week, my grandfather excitedly showed me a meme of a bear trying to high five a man in a car, while its bear friends looked on.
It took me years to convince my grandfather to join social media, but it‚Äôs worked out for the better (I guess). But as older generations finally come to grips with a decade-old pastime, the kids have moved on to something more mysterious: the blockchain.
Tech VCs in Southeast Asia face the same generational hurdle in embracing the latest craze among millennials and Gen Z.¬†
Despite the saviness of these investors, finding a way to put their money behind this disruptive phenomenon is a big ask. Traditional VC firms are playing it safe for now because backing crypto firms demands a different skill set and expectations. Add some regulatory uncertainty to that mix, and it‚Äôs clear to see why VC firms aren‚Äôt quite ready to dive into the deep end yet.
Meanwhile, crypto firms are keener on bringing in investors who have extensive connections within the crypto ecosystem, which might not be the strongest suit of typical VCs.
My colleague Ardi recently unpacked why blockchain players are struggling to win investor confidence. And while traditional VC firms are still wrapping their heads around the blockchain, crypto-native investors already have a game plan.
Today we look at:

The limited participation of SEA‚Äôs tech VCs in the crypto race
How a VC firm backed by Bukalapak‚Äôs founders has bet on an Indonesian fintech startup that could be the next game changer 
 Other newsy highlights such as Binance‚Äôs media gambit and a Singapore-based VC‚Äôs first fund.

Crypto VCs built different

Image credit: Timmy Loen

Though they are few in number, crypto VCs are playing the investment game on a different level. Like college grads, these firms host ‚Äúparty rounds,‚Äù where a bunch of investors take part but often don‚Äôt have a lead backer. These rounds are much smaller than what typical tech VCs in Southeast Asia are used to, and they don‚Äôt come with the same kinds of exits either.¬†
All these factors have made traditional VCs cautious about going all-in with crypto-based projects. Tech VCs have their work cut out for them to gain the trust of crypto founders, but that effort may be necessary to ensure that the industry will grow ‚Äúbeyond the crypto bubble.‚Äù¬†
Old school meets new game: Southeast Asia‚Äôs crypto startups collectively raised funding from over 150 investors last year, according to Tech in Asia data. Of these backers, only 11 are conventional tech VCs based in the region. These include Singapore‚Äôs Vertex Ventures and B Capital, Indonesia‚Äôs BRI Ventures and Intudo, and Thailand‚Äôs SCB 10X.
Spoiled for choice: The region‚Äôs crypto players have the luxury of picking their investors since their deals are always oversubscribed, said Irene Umar, co-founder of blockchain-focused Yield Guild Games Southeast Asia. These firms are only looking for backers with crypto know-how and contacts in the ecosystem, which sometimes leaves typical tech VCs high and dry.
Gatekeepers of deal flow: Full-fledged crypto VCs have it good right now as they have an edge over their more traditional counterparts when it comes to deal flow and high-quality projects. Meanwhile, traditional VCs still have a long way to go in getting involved with the community and gaining its respect.¬†

Init 6, the VC firm led by Bukalapak co-founders Achmad Zaky and Nugroho ‚ÄúXinuc‚Äù Herucahyono, has invested in Monit,¬†which has the potential to be a game changer in Indonesia‚Äôs B2B fintech sector.
A silent splurge: While Init 6 publicly announced only four deals in 2021, it made a total of 15 investments. It aims to make Monit a more productive and efficient expense management system that offers multiple financial instruments bank transfers, cards, savings ‚Äì on a single platform.¬†
The Brex flex: Init 6 likened Monit to US-based giant Brex, which grew to a billion-dollar business in just two years and is now valued at over US$12 billion. However, the two companies differ in their approach: Brex encourages businesses to spend more by incentivizing employees, while Monit‚Äôs software is designed to help companies boost profits and reduce expenses.¬†
Bigger and better: As proven local unicorn builders, Zaky and Xinuc are looking to double Init 6‚Äôs existing portfolio. They‚Äôre also considering elevating the fund to a conventional limited partner-general partner (LP-GP) structure.

Hello reader,
This being the first edition of the Opening Bell, it‚Äôs only appropriate that we touch on the retail trading frenzy that has gripped stock markets around the world. Easy access to online brokerages ‚Äì coupled with a bit of FOMO ‚Äì amid the Covid-19 pandemic drove countless tech-savvy millennials to park idle money in stocks.
However, a closer look reveals a hidden underlying trend. It seems that online broking startups in Asia have stolen a march on their more experienced banking counterparts.
For instance, Zerodha, a fintech darling of Indian millennials, shook up the decades-old broking industry with its zero-brokerage-fee model and is now comfortably the country‚Äôs largest broker, having more than double the active clients than its closest listed counterpart, ICICI Securities Ltd (ISEC, NSE), which runs the trading platform ICICIDirect.
Meanwhile, online stock brokerage Ajaib in 2021 became Indonesia‚Äôs fastest unicorn and is leaving more established players, such as Bank Mandiri‚Äôs Mandiri Sekuritas (BMRI, IDX), biting the dust, having captured over a million of the archipelago‚Äôs roughly 2.7 million equity investors.
However, given the close links between online stock broking and digibank services, Ajaib may soon face heated competition from players such as Bukalapak (BUKA, IDX), which is set to enter Indonesia‚Äôs digibank race.
The Indonesian ecommerce giant‚Äôs co-founders have even doubled down on the fintech sector, with their VC firm, Init 6, joining the seed round of Monit, a B2B fintech startup, Tech in Asia exclusively reported.
Speaking of ecommerce giants, we released the first episode of our video series on how Shopee made use of Sea Group‚Äôs (SE, NYSE) war chest and Tencent‚Äôs backing to dethrone Lazada and become Southeast Asia‚Äôs top ecommerce platform within five years.
Meanwhile, IPO-bound J&amp;T Express, another Tencent-backed company, is making waves. With a pre-money valuation of about US$20 billion, the logistics firm has scaled new heights by riding the boom in Indonesia‚Äôs ecommerce space. Our premium story looks at the keys to its global ambitions.
And, now back to the pandemic-induced retail trading boom, which has led to wild market swings and even brought on the ‚Äúmeme stock‚Äù phenomenon (members of ‚Äã‚Äãr/BursaBets and r/WallStreetBets, we‚Äôre looking at you üëÄ). However, this is not always a good thing, as the cautionary tale of stockbroking app Robinhood (HOOD, NDAQ) has shown us.
The online stockbroking pioneer has seen its share price collapse by around 84% from its 52-week high of US$85 after heightened regulatory scrutiny. Additionally, the US trading frenzy has shown signs of waning amid climbing interest rates and inflation.
It has not all been smooth sailing for online stockbrokers in Asia either. Stocks of Tencent-backed Futu Holdings (FUTU, NDAQ) and UP Fintech (TIGR, NDAQ), which runs Tiger Brokers, have endured a torrid year despite churning out promising numbers.
They have come under the microscope as China‚Äôs central bank has warned that online brokerages not licensed by Beijing were operating illegally if they were serving Chinese clients through the internet.

üá®üá≥Alibaba (BABA, NYSE): The pioneer of Singles‚Äô Day is reporting its third-quarter results during Valentine‚Äôs week, with its earnings expected on Tuesday, February 15. It‚Äôs been a tumultuous couple of years for the Chinese ecommerce behemoth amid the Xi administration‚Äôs fierce crackdown on the country‚Äôs tech companies. The stock is currently trading more than 50% below its 52-week high of US$274.29.
üáÆüá≥Zomato (ZOMATO, NSE): Having plunged nearly 6% on Friday, this stock is likely to be on the radar of the ‚Äúbuy-the-dip‚Äù kind of investor. The foodtech giant reported a loss of ‚Äã‚Äã998 million rupees (US$13.3 million) in the third quarter. The platform‚Äôs losses shrank 74% year over year, thanks largely to a one-time gain from the US$50 million sale of sports facilities provider Fitso to Curefit.
üá©üá™Delivery Hero SE (DHER, ETR): The parent company of Foodpanda, the Asian food delivery giant, lost more than a third of its market value ‚Äåafter its FYE 2022 earnings outlook fell short of market expectations last week. Foodpanda‚Äôs results for the fourth quarter, however, were a bit more upbeat as the firm reported US$997.8 million in quarterly revenue ‚Äì an almost 62% jump from the previous year.
üáÆüá≥FSN E-Commerce Ventures (NYKAA, NSE): The Nykaa parent shed more than 10% last week after its third-quarter net profit slumped 58%. While it is one of the few profitable startups in India, the online fashion and beauty retailer‚Äôs quarterly expenses ballooned 91%.

Hi there,
Clean energy is a red-hot segment where advances are happening quickly. For example, renewables have become sought-after commodities as their prices plummeted over the past few years. But this growth has also given rise to a problem: insufficient storage capacity.
In this issue, we‚Äôll explore how storage troubles are holding back the renewable energy transition and look at the push for innovation in this space.
Enjoy reading!

THE BIG STORYMeet the players fighting plastic scourge in SEA

Plastic waste startups are on the rise, but more needs to be done to scale their impact.

DEEP READS
1Ô∏è‚É£ Power storage is world‚Äôs next big net zero challenge
There‚Äôs an urgent problem in energy transition that has been largely overlooked: storage.
Renewables such as solar and wind power fluctuate because the sun doesn‚Äôt always shine, and the wind doesn‚Äôt always blow. As renewable penetration increases, the cost of its intermittency will also shoot up. To ensure a constant supply of energy, back-ups are necessary during downtimes. But how do you go about this?
Energy storage systems are a low-carbon way to do it. Building up long-duration storage capacity (8 hours or more) is crucial step towards energy transition. At present, global capacity to store renewables is inadequate, considering the demand. The US, for example, is capable of storing 595 gigawatt hours, which is roughly just an hour of its demand.
Power providers are starting to focus on developing new technologies. Tech giants are also getting in the act: Google and Microsoft, for instance, are among the corporations that recently joined Long Duration Energy Storage Council, an organization that was formed at the United Nations Climate Change Conference 2021 (COP26). Moreover, capacity markets that provide financial support to companies supplying storage capacity are shaping up.
Energy storage is currently concentrated in a handful of developed markets, including the US, UK, France, Australia, and Japan. China and India are also pouring investment into the space. And yet, solar and wind power are not abundant in most of these countries.

The UK, for example, is grappling with this problem as it works to phase out fossil fuels by 2050. One of the hurdles is the lack of sites where pumped hydro storage plants can be built. Pumped hydro is how most electricity is stored, accounting for around 98% of global capacity.
Japan is also trying to advance the energy storage front. The government is planning to begin requiring power utilities to open up their grids to energy storage systems operated by other companies, hoping to grow its storage capacity. The government will also subsidize up to half the cost of battery storage systems to bolster its competitiveness against other types of energy storage.
Another way to store energy is lithium-ion batteries. Its usage has become prevalent as the cost per kilowatt hour of storage drops, thanks to electric-car makers. But because these batteries are designed to store relatively small amounts of energy, few believe that they will play a big role in stabilizing renewables supply during long-haul winters, for instance. There‚Äôs also no significant reduction in costs with the expansion of storage capacity.
Still, innovation happening in the space. Power providers in California are working on a long-duration storage system based on lithium-ion batteries.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Cryptocurrency traders move into carbon markets
Cryptocurrency‚Äôs outsized energy consumption has been under a lot of scrutiny, including from the likes of Tesla‚Äôs Elon Musk and, more recently, Mozilla founder Jamie Zalinski. A new study by Bank of America shows that in terms of annual emissions, Bitcoin has outpaced fossil fuel-reliant companies such as American Airlines.
It‚Äôs no surprise then that cryptocurrency companies are eager to clear their names.
Toucan, a Switzerland-based nonprofit specializing in decentralized finance, launched a carbon offset project in October that lets users trade carbon credits on cryptocurrency exchanges. Its carbon credits are linked to tokens called Base Carbon Tonne (BCT). According to Toucan, the goal is to create a more transparent platform by using real-time pricing data and record of trades to track who gets to take credit for funding green projects available to the public.
But critics are skeptical, pointing out that the Toucan team chooses to maintain its anonymity ‚Äì a move that‚Äôs at odds with its transparency claim. But believers including billionaire Mark Cuban think that the idea of cleaner cryptocurrency is promising.
There are a myriad of new projects that aim to do something similar, from offering NFTs directly linked to purchasing carbon offsets to setting up mining farms that run on renewable energy.
The booming crypto space is clashing with the carbon reduction pledges made by many countries. Lawmakers in the US and other places that host cryptomining farms are now closely examining the carbon footprint of this practice. Regulators in the European Union are also seeking to outlaw cryptomining activities.

1Ô∏è‚É£ China showcases low-carbon tech for ‚Äògreen‚Äô Games
The Beijing Winter Olympics Committee says that its carbon-reduction efforts, such as retrofitting buildings from the 2008 Summer Games and using renewable energy, have saved about 158,300 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions. From the prep work to the post-event period, the Games‚Äô footprint is estimated to be equivalent to 1.028 million tonnes of carbon dioxide.
Why it matters:
Despite these measures, Beijing still faces scrutiny over water usage because the need to make artificial snow puts more strain on water-scarce regions. Pandemic restrictions also have helped Beijing reduce emissions.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Amazon leads corporate clean-energy purchases in record year
The ecommerce behemoth led a landmark year for renewable-energy purchases among corporations worldwide, according to a new report. In 2021, big businesses snapped up 31.1 gigawatts of clean energy capacity, with Amazon taking 20% of that total.
Why it matters:
More companies are shifting to clean energy as solar and wind power prices fall, making fossil fuels a less cost-effective option.
3Ô∏è‚É£ China says U.S. tariff extension on solar products hurts new energy trade
Continuing to impose tariffs on solar products ‚Äúwon‚Äôt contribute to the healthy development of America‚Äôs solar industry and distorts the international trade order of solar as a new energy product,‚Äù according to China‚Äôs Ministry of Commerce.
First introduced by the Trump administration in 2018, the the tariffs were recently extended by US President Joe Biden for another four years. However, the new terms excluded two-sided panels that are commonly deployed in bigger projects.
Why it matters:
Figuring out how to treat imported solar panels and cells remains a divisive issue in the US. Tariffs on products from China, the world‚Äôs largest supplier, can hold back the deployment of renewable energy in the US. Without the restriction, however, local solar players would be unable to compete with their Chinese counterparts.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Huawei bolts into Japan with renewable power storage, chasing Tesla
The Chinese telco is expected to start selling large-scale battery systems for clean energy storage in Japan by March. Huawei will purchase small battery packs from CATL, a leading lithium-ion battery supplier, and bundle them into shipping container-sized units with the storage capacity of approximately 200x as much as a standard household battery.
Why it matters:
Japan is trying to move away from fossil fuels, and having adequate capacity in its power grid is crucial for the massive deployment of renewable energy. The country‚Äôs large-scale battery industry is an increasingly competitive space occupied by players like Tesla.

732616,2022-02-14T05:41:39,TikTok‚Äôs rumored Shein competitor shuts down,"Dmonstudio, the fast-fashion platform reportedly launched by TikTok to go head-to-head with industry titan Shein, has ceased operations on February 11.

Dmonstudio‚Äôs website on February 8

The company has posted a notice of its shutdown on the home page of its website. Dmonstudio said it will still provide after-sale services to users that have made purchases on the platform. A snapshot of the platform‚Äôs website taken on February 8 (above) shows that the company was still holding special offers for Valentine‚Äôs Day.

732582,2022-02-14T05:02:20,Inside the tsunami of NFTs in India,"Vimal Chandran‚Äôs mother often worries about her 30-something son‚Äôs obsession with pictures of ‚Äúmonkeys on the internet.‚Äù
The monkey pictures she‚Äôs worried about aren‚Äôt just regular images, of course. They‚Äôre NFTs (non-fungible tokens) of apathetic primates. But the Bored Ape Yacht Club isn‚Äôt exactly a household name yet in the South Indian city of Palakkad, where Chandran, a visual artist, currently lives.
Until last year, Chandran himself hadn‚Äôt seriously looked into NFTs. This changed after Mike Winkelmann, or Beeple as he‚Äôs better known, sold his NFT for US$69 million at a Christie‚Äôs auction in March 2021. Soon, Chandran found himself minting and buying NFTs.
In December last year, Chandran‚Äôs NFT, titled WAGMI (an acronym for we‚Äôre all gonna make it), became the most expensive NFT sold on the NFT platform of Binance-owned crypto exchange WazirX.

WAGMI by Vimal Chandran / Photo courtesy: WazirX

While WAGMI was sold for 8,088 WRX (WazirX‚Äôs native token) or about US$7,700, WazirX‚Äôs total NFT sales have crossed 308,000 WRX since the launch of its NFT platform last June.
The crypto exchange is just one of the many companies that are riding on what can only be described as a tsunami of NFT offerings in India. BeyondLife Club, Ikonz, BollyCoin, and Social Swag are some of the startups that have thrown their hat into the ring.
The rise of NFTs and cryptocurrencies in India has seen its fair share of ups and downs as it has in other nations like Singapore and Indonesia.
India‚Äôs banking regulator effectively hampered the growth of crypto-related startups in 2018 by barring banks from dealing with crypto exchanges. This ban was lifted only in 2020, with the intervention of the Supreme Court. But crypto-related businesses are still not in the clear, as there isn‚Äôt really a legal framework surrounding these companies.
However, on February 1, the country‚Äôs finance minister announced a 30% tax on gains from crypto-related assets. While enthusiasts bemoaned the steep taxes, the announcement put talks of a possible crypto-related ban to rest.
The timing couldn‚Äôt have been better. Globally, NFT sales volumes amounted to US$24.9 billion in 2021 compared to US$94.9 million the year before, according to data from DappRadar.
Industry players might be reluctant to put a definite valuation on this evolving space.
‚ÄúImagine a world where everything you see, from the buildings, roads, and artworks, are all made up of NFTs; it‚Äôs hard to put a tag on that. It‚Äôs changed so much already so quickly,‚Äù says Sandesh Suvarna, co-founder of WazirX‚Äôs NFT marketplace.
A celebrity-backed gold rush
A number of India‚Äôs NFT startups were launched in 2021 and quickly drew in investors. For example, Faze Technologies, a cricket-themed NFT platform,  raised US$17.4 million in a round led by Tiger Global in November 2021.
Another startup, Lysto, which is launching tools for people to create and sell NFTs, raised US$3 million the same month from backers like Beenext, Flipkart‚Äôs Binny Bansal, and Cred‚Äôs Kunal Shah.
Chennai-based GuardiaLink, a no-code NFT platform, raised US$12 million from Kalaari Capital last December. (The VC firm also invested in WazirX but exited after Binance acquired the firm.)
At least three Indian NFT startups have already seen funding in the new year, including NFT social discovery platform Wall and Colexion, a marketplace building a digital museum focused on celebrity NFTs.
The third company that has raised funding this year is Chennai-based Diginoor. Teenagers Shaamil Karim and Yash Rathod took a break from college to build the startup, which raised US$1 million in January. Like many in the space, Diginoor is banking on cinema content like iconic film dialogue and film costumes to make NFTs that appeal to movie buffs.
The rise of these startups coincides with another trend: Indian celebrities ‚Äì high-profile actors and athletes ‚Äì launching their own NFTs. For instance, actor Amitabh Bachchan sold a recital of his late father‚Äôs poem, Madhushala, as well as some autographed posters and other memorabilia on BeyondLife for US$966,000 in November.
Soon after, BollyCoin closed a pre-sale round which saw US$2 million worth of its tokens sold for NFTs based on actor Salman Khan‚Äôs Dabangg film franchise. Meanwhile, physical collectibles and NFTs made from a sports film called 83, which documents India winning the cricket world cup in 1983, sold out under an hour for about US$13,400. Popular local actors like Kamal Hassan and Rajnikanth have also announced their interest to dabble in NFTs through platforms Fantico and Diginoor, respectively.
While NFT-related news in the US often piggybacks on the popularity of luxury brands such as Gucci and Balenciaga, actors and sports celebrities are the ones drawing people to the NFT conversation in India, much like how K-pop labels have stoked NFT interest in South Korea
‚ÄúWe definitely want more celebrities to be associated with NFTs because this will bring in more crypto adoption,‚Äù says Suvarna of WazirX.

While NFT marketplaces offer new artists the chance to experiment, the celebrity-side of the trend banks on the fan base that an actor or sports superstar commands. In some ways, this is just a natural progression of the Indian audience‚Äôs adoration of Bollywood-themed memorabilia.
‚ÄúFor celebrities, this is about monetizing a legacy they‚Äôve already built,‚Äù says Dileep Seinberg, founder and CEO of blockchain and crypto consulting firm ThinkChain.
While interest in NFTs feels like it‚Äôs been around forever, the trend began to make a lot of noise in India particularly around September 2021, says Kyle Lopez, co-founder of BollyCoin.
‚ÄúI realized that the adoption of NFTs was going to be a lot larger than that of cryptocurrency because of a whole lot of use cases in the real world,‚Äù says Lopez, adding that BollyCoin was born because ‚Äúit was only a matter of time before someone brought blockchain and Bollywood together.‚Äù
Familiarity can be key to driving adoption of NFTs in India. This explains why WazirX has also tapped into the intersection of the country‚Äôs history and royalty to market its platform. In December 2021, it launched a collection of NFTs inspired by the Wadiyar dynasty which once ruled the kingdom of Mysore in India.
Even traditional media houses have pulled out their old hits and revamped them as NFTs. For instance, media conglomerate Viacom18 launched a marketplace that will feature NFTs from local pop culture properties such as the prank show Bakra and reality TV show Roadies. Set to go live on February 14, Viacom18‚Äôs NFT offerings are meant to be ‚Äúedgy and quirky,‚Äù says Anshul Ailawadi, head of youth, music, and English entertainment at Viacom18.

NFTs offer fans a chance to own a part of something they‚Äôre really passionate about, says Ailawadi. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the consumer side. As an organization, this opens up new avenues for us as Web 3.0 becomes a reality.‚Äù
T-Series, one of India‚Äôs most famous music labels which now also doubles as a production house, has also announced the launch of its NFTs and a metaverse,
Several India and Bollywood-related metaverses are currently in the works, including one by Singapore-based Fantico, which raised funds from Animoca Brands and other investors in December last year.
An open but exclusive world
NFTs have played a big role in making sure the original creator gets their dues and royalties, says Suvarna of WazirX. He primarily sees two kinds of users on the platform: the collectors who choose to keep the artworks and the traders who frequently buy and resell NFTs. Last December, a WazirX customer earned a 2,000% profit after reselling an NFT.
Besides being tradable assets, NFTs can be used in the physical world too. Take the Sunburn music festival, for instance. The property partnered with WazirX to drop Sunburn NFTs, which customers could use to attend the actual event.

The Green Room is a virtual club founded by BollyCoin / Photo courtesy: BollyCoin

In some cases, people can ask for the NFTs they want: BollyCoin, for instance, is creating a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) to give people voting rights to gauge which celebrities they‚Äôd want NFTs from. Those who want to participate in the voting need to buy BollyCoin, but don‚Äôt have to buy an NFT.
But those who do buy NFTs from special collections have access to The Green Room, a club with exclusive benefits like awards or invitations to virtual events.

While a lot of platforms are joining NFTs with physical collectibles or events, BollyCoin wants to stick to the virtual world. ‚ÄúIf we organize events in the real world, the numbers that we‚Äôd see would be much smaller than what we can access in the virtual world. The real world limits us,‚Äù BollyCoin‚Äôs Lopez says.
Others see it best to cash in on the physical world. WazirX, for instance, has 10,000 artworks from the CryptoSauga Star Club (CSS Club). Those who buy from this collection will be part of the CSS Club and get perks in select bars and freebies in the physical world, says Suvarna.
The one constant with NFT marketplaces is that it‚Äôs an ever-evolving space, says Lopez. But one thing‚Äôs clear: While NFT platforms are open to all, they‚Äôll also be driven by the exclusivity they offer.
Are there really takers?
While startups rush to create use cases for NFTs, one wonders if there will be many takers for these projects. The following examples tell us that there might just be a large enough audience.
Late last year, Ram Gopal Varma, a popular film director, produced a 90-minute film called Dangerous. Out of the 600,000 tokens the team created for the film, the director and his team held on to 100,000. The rest sold out.
As the production house prepares for the film‚Äôs release in theaters and online, those who‚Äôve bought its NFTs stand to get a share of the revenues, according to the film‚Äôs website.
Seinberg says it‚Äôs likely that more directors and YouTubers could take this route, as NFT adoption in India‚Äôs Tier 2 and 3 towns ‚Äì much like TikTok when it was legal in the country ‚Äì is set to rise.
Youngsters in these towns increasingly have more spending power, but traditional investment opportunities like buying real estate or stocks or investing in fixed deposits don‚Äôt hold the appeal they once used to.
And this is beginning to show.
India‚Äôs small towns have received crypto well: WazirX says sign-ups from these towns have gone up by 2,648% on the platform.

Winging It (aka Wing it like Wingnesh) / Photo courtesy: Fully Faltoo, Viacom18

‚ÄúPeople have learned how to use banking products and make complex videos for social media. Platforms such as OpenSea have already made it easy to mint NFTs,‚Äù says Seinberg. What he‚Äôs more concerned about is the base price at which NFTs sell for the first time. Friends and families can jack up the price for the first few buys, he says, and the blockchain just records the prices going up.
Issues such as interoperability between different blockchains and user interfaces could also pose barriers in the early stages. Novice NFT artists might also find the ‚Äúgas fee‚Äù on ethereum-based platforms as a roadblock.
Budding enthusiasts need to be aware of the opportunities and risks associated with digital assets and make informed decisions, says Ailawadi of Viacom18. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs an opportunity to build trust in this ecosystem.‚Äù
Buyers might also not have the inclination to hold on to their NFTs (or hodl, as crypto enthusiasts say) and end up withdrawing their revenues. This may be particularly relevant in India, where earnings from crypto-related assets would attract a 30% tax for sellers. The heavy taxation might discourage those who‚Äôre just starting their NFT careers, says Chandran.
Still, new experiments continue to play out. A couple in Tamil Nadu, India, recently hosted what‚Äôs been billed as Asia‚Äôs first wedding in the metaverse.

732338,2022-02-14T02:00:03,Set up for success: Australia‚Äôs booming fintech sector,"Over the last year, fintech has boomed. The vertical attracted a record US$34 billion in venture capital in the second quarter of 2021 alone.
In Australia, where the tech sector has grown big enough to generate around US$120 billion for the economy, opportunities for fintech startups ‚Äì and their investors ‚Äì abound. In fact, fintech has grown from a US$187 million sector to a US$3 billion industry between 2015 and 2021, according to national fintech association Fintech Australia.

Photo credit: Frances Gunn

As a result, the country has shot to the top of the 2021 global fintech rankings by data analytics company Findexable. Australia currently sits in sixth place globally and occupies the second spot in Asia Pacific.
Nurtured growth
The number of new fintech firms in Australia has grown to 730, which include well-established unicorns like digital payments firm Airwallex, buy now, pay later (BNPL) company Afterpay, and insurance firm Cover Genius.
And these players have been making a lot of noise. Afterpay, for example, has driven US$4.5 billion in net benefits to its merchants in 2021 alone, while Cover Genius has recently partnered with Indian ecommerce major Flipkart to provide insurance coverage for furniture products sold on the platform.
And despite international headaches over Covid-19, money continues to pour into the sector. Airwallex raised US$100 million from a host of investors in November last year, while green energy-focused point-of-sale company Brighte bagged the same amount a month later.
‚ÄúThe fintech industry originally set out to disrupt the traditional financial services industry,‚Äù says Stephen Skulley, the senior trade and investment commissioner at Australia‚Äôs trade and investment commission, Austrade. ‚ÄúHowever, in recent years, we‚Äôve seen a shift toward collaboration.‚Äù

Stephen Skulley, senior trade and investment commissioner at Austrade / Photo credit: Austrade

He points out that initiatives like Westpac Bank‚Äôs Reinventure and the National Australia Bank Ventures demonstrate that fintech firms are not separate from Australia‚Äôs US$7 trillion financial services sector but are a natural extension of it.
All this growth is partly due to the Australian government‚Äôs systematic effort to foster the digital ecosystem through regulation, talent, and bilateral connections.
Innovation-friendly regulations make it easy for startups to access licenses to offer credit and financial services. And Australia‚Äôs partnerships with countries like the UK and Singapore cultivate opportunities for businesses in both territories as well. In June last year, Australia and the Monetary Authority of Singapore started negotiations over a ‚ÄúFintech Bridge‚Äù that would enhance and encourage innovation and business opportunities in the two countries.
Australia‚Äôs tech talent pool also ranks highly, placing eighth in both the UN‚Äôs 2020 Human Development Index and Cisco‚Äôs annual Digital Readiness Index, which measures the skills needed to support digital innovation.
‚ÄúOur greatest asset is our creative, resourceful, and enterprising people,‚Äù says Skulley. ‚ÄúWe use our global ties to connect with the best the world has to offer.‚Äù
Fintech as a bridge to the region
Not only has the Australian government supported fintech firms in the country, it has also helped startups looking to expand abroad. This is important as areas like Southeast Asia are set to experience significant growth. Case in point, the region‚Äôs internet economy is poised to double to US$363 billion by 2025.
Skulley points to Australia‚Äôs proximity to North and Southeast Asia as the reason the country has been recognized for its ‚Äúculturally sensitive and multilingual‚Äù workforce that understands the importance of these overseas markets. This is an important factor that has helped open doors for businesses in the wider region.
‚ÄúI think a lot of people in Australia do have an understanding of how important the Southeast Asian market and the region is to growth,‚Äù says Tasneen Padiath, managing director for Southeast Asia at Australian BNPL firm Zip. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs certainly built a lot of bridges.‚Äù

Tasneen Padiath, managing director for Southeast Asia at Zip / Photo credit: Zip

Zip conducted an internal study and found that there are 90 million customers in Southeast Asia who want BNPL options, prompting the firm to plan its expansion into the market. Its first foray into Southeast Asia was through an investment in Philippine firm TendoPay, which later led the company to open an office in Singapore.
According to Padiath, the transition was smooth due to the support of Singapore‚Äôs Economic Development Board and Austrade. Austrade not only provided intelligence and data reports on each market but also the crucial contacts the company needed to hit the ground running.
‚ÄúWe shared our plans with Austrade quite openly because we knew that they could be a support for us,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThey were very well-connected to the [Singaporean] government, regulators, and key corporates. Austrade has championed us as we look to make those connections in local markets.‚Äù
‚ÄúOn the cusp of things‚Äù
Padiath says that Zip will continue to work together with Austrade as the BNPL company expands throughout Southeast Asia.
‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre on the cusp of things in Southeast Asia ‚Äì we see a lot of opportunity in terms of payments here,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúCashless transactions have increased 30% to 50% since the pandemic and lending is also forecasted to grow.‚Äù
Padiath believes that Australian fintech companies are well-placed to take advantage of the opportunities around them. She points out that over 80% of Australian fintech firms have been around for three or more years, a sign of maturity and growth in the sector.
‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs pretty obvious that Australian fintechs are becoming internationally competitive now,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll definitely see more and more global fintechs coming out of Australia.‚Äù
For Austrade‚Äôs Skulley, the future for Australian fintech businesses clearly lies abroad, as more than 70% of companies look to expand internationally, according to a 2021 census by management consultancy Ernst &amp; Young.
The Australian government, Skulley says, views the fintech sector as a driver of economic recovery. Over US$6 million has been set aside in the 2020-2021 Federal Budget over the next four years to support the fintech and regtech industries, and the Technology Council of Australia has published a roadmap detailing how it will create a million more tech jobs.
‚ÄúThe data shows that when it comes to working internationally, Australian fintech doesn‚Äôt simply ‚Äòshow potential‚Äô ‚Äì it is now succeeding internationally and growing,‚Äù he affirms.

The Australian Trade and Investment Commission (Austrade) is the Australian government‚Äôs agency for promoting trade, investment, and international education both at home and abroad. Austrade advocates for the unique strengths of Australian fintechs and the value they will bring to new markets.

Hi readers,
Did you know a hobbyist drone is cheaper than an iPhone 13 in Mayalsia? I had no clue until an acquaintance, who happens to be a drone tech geek, brought it up.
Of course, these drones capture visuals and aren‚Äôt like the souped-up ones firms use to tackle high risk or tricky jobs like asset inspection or last-mile medicine deliveries.
But capturing visuals is how Aerodyne, the world‚Äôs top drone services provider, got its start. The drone tech firm was founded in 2014 by Kamarul A. Muhamed, who saw the potential of using drones in bigger jobs after using them in his media production company.
Kamarul was in many ways a first mover. He also proved his business model could work after he landed a gig to inspect assets of Petronas, Malaysia‚Äôs national oil company.
The rest, as they say, is history.
But as Aerodyne has cemented itself as the go-to drone tech provider, other upstarts are also looking to wrestle for domestic and regional market share.
Larger corporations are also mulling their own in-house drone pilot teams, while others, such as Capital A (formerly AirAsia), have set up pilot-training centers.
Aside from entrepreneurial smarts, policy has also been key to the competitive landscape in Malaysia.
Both federal and state governments have opened up sites for drone players, including those based overseas such as Singapore‚Äôs Garuda Robotics, to test their solutions at the Medini drone test site, considered the largest in Southeast Asia.
Can policymakers keep up with demand? We also can‚Äôt dismiss privacy and security concerns. These tensions will continue to surface as Malaysia pushes the boundaries of drone tech.
For now, Aerodyne seems to be thriving and is on an acquisition spree, with its latest buy bolstering its data analytics and AI capabilities. While looking at a potential listing on the Nasdaq or Tokyo Stock Exchange, it‚Äôs also not ruling out a dual listing on Bursa Malaysia.
But how long can it be Malaysia‚Äôs drone darling?

The best sports narratives involve coming back from adversity. Manchester United‚Äôs 1999 Champions League victory, where they scored twice in the final minutes to win it all, or Dirk Nowitzki bouncing back from losing the 2006 NBA Finals to become a champion in 2011 will live long in the memory of fans all over the world.
A comeback story is no less appealing in the tech and startup world. After suffering large losses and burning its cash reserves in 2019, Singapore-based startup Zimplistic ‚Äì creators of fully automated flatbread maker Rotimatic ‚Äì is back in the black, becoming profitable for the first time in 2021.


Too fast, too furious: The rush to do a full rollout of the Rotimatic product, which drove up supply chain costs, may have been the main cause of the company‚Äôs initial troubles, said co-founder Pranoti Nagarkar Israni.


From the ashes: In October 2020, investment vehicle Light Ray Holdings acquired Zimplistic after the firm‚Äôs previous investors rushed for the exit door. The turmoil drove the company‚Äôs co-founders to create a plan for financial sustainability in 2021.


Cutting costs: Zimplistic drove down its spending by reducing its staff count by over half as well as leveraging Light Ray Holdings‚Äô contracts and relationships to optimize raw material costs.

732396,2022-02-11T05:00:47,Are SEA‚Äôs tech VCs missing out on the crypto craze?,"In 2018, the team at VC firm Intudo Ventures was on its usual hunt for US-based Indonesian founders when it met Jeth Soetoyo. At the time, the Harvard student was starting a cryptocurrency exchange called Pintu.
Like almost all of its peers then, Intudo was not seeking to land a deal in the cryptocurrency space. However, Soetoyo‚Äôs ‚Äúhigh degree of conviction, passion, and market-fit for Indonesia‚Äù convinced the firm‚Äôs partners to lead Pintu‚Äôs initial financing round in March 2019.

The Pintu app / Photo credit: Pintu

Today, as crypto-related sectors like blockchain, Web3, and the metaverse appear to gain steam, Intudo is still an anomaly. It is one of only a handful of conventional tech VCs in the region that has crypto firms in its portfolio.
When Pintu raised a US$35 million series A+ funding round in August last year, for example, Intudo was one of only two conventional tech VCs on the company‚Äôs cap table of 11 investors. The VC firm was also the only one from Southeast Asia, with Pintu‚Äôs nine other backers being US and China-based crypto funds.
This is far from an isolated case in the region.
Tech in Asia data shows that Southeast Asia‚Äôs crypto startups collectively raised funding from over 150 investors last year. Of these backers, only 11 are conventional tech VCs based in the region. These include Singapore‚Äôs Vertex Ventures and B Capital, Indonesia‚Äôs BRI Ventures and Intudo, and Thailand‚Äôs SCB 10X.
The rest are mostly global VC firms specializing in the crypto sphere, such as Coinbase Ventures, Pantera Capital, and Alameda Research.


Different ball game
For Intudo founding partner Eddy Chan, the limited participation of local tech VCs in the crypto space is not surprising. After all, the nature of crypto investing is markedly different compared to venture investing.
For example, pure-play crypto companies, he explains, often like to build ‚Äúparty rounds,‚Äù fundraises where many investors participate but often don‚Äôt have a lead backer. These firms seek out investors that can provide access to retail backers and have large global followings.
Typically, the allocations into these rounds are small due to the large number of participating investors, which makes it difficult for VCs to build positions and requires that they employ a more index-based approach to investing.
The way portfolio companies are managed also differs significantly. Traditional tech VCs usually focus on maintaining and growing positions in promising companies over an extended period until a major event like an IPO or M&amp;A. For crypto firms, however, investors may look to liquidity early on or watch trade activity to time sell-offs, operating more like hedge funds. As is the case, managing these companies requires a different set of skills and timeline expectations.

Then, there are also differences in due diligence. In the crypto space, the due diligence process is skewed toward the qualitative analysis of a founder‚Äôs capability to build a project or the evaluation of potential token price performance ‚Äì a far cry from how VCs usually approach a deal. Investments in crypto firms often come before the company has generated any revenue and require significant conviction on a VC‚Äôs part before they commit, much like putting money behind a startup raising a pre-seed or seed round.
This means ‚Äúseed-stage investors may have an easier time crossing over [to investing in crypto] than their later-stage peers,‚Äù Chan says.
While the disparities are apparent, Sequoia India believes crypto projects and businesses share fundamental similarities with tech ventures. For example, Web2 and Web3 companies, which deal in new versions of the World Wide Web, are not too dissimilar in the way they scale and design their product, attract and motivate talent, and how they build a long-term business.
‚ÄúLots of lessons from Web2 can and should be taken to Web3. And, many of the ideas we see coming to Web3 are from Web2 founders who deeply understand a domain and can apply concepts from both to build something unique,‚Äù says Sequoia India managing director Shailesh Lakhani.
Several venture capitalists Tech in Asia spoke to point to investment mandates from limited partners (LPs) as a main obstacle to crypto dealmaking.
‚ÄúFor regular VCs, crypto is usually not part of the mandate [from their LPs],‚Äù says Aldi Adrian Hartanto, partner at Arise, a fund co-managed by MDI Ventures and Finch Capital.
In his own fund, Hartanto says he negotiates with LPs to adjust the mandate so his team can invest more freely in crypto and blockchain projects. This is a move he expects several of his peers will take, though not all of them will be successful in getting LP approval.
Those that end up sticking with their existing mandates will have their hands tied as far as investing in crypto companies is concerned. Some, however, may invest a minimal amount, which is usually allocated for ‚Äúopportunistic deals‚Äù outside their mandate, he adds.
For the most part, Irene Umar, co-founder of blockchain-focused gaming startup YGG SEA recognizes this challenge.
A former venture capitalist herself, Umar said many LPs and investment committees of VC firms would be ‚Äúscratching their heads‚Äù at the idea of investing in tokens as opposed to equity.
Picking preferred partners
According to Umar, the lack of deals in the crypto space from traditional tech VCs may also be down to the startups themselves. Crypto deals are always oversubscribed, she says, so startups have the luxury of picking their preferred investors, and they would usually go for those that have more knowledge in the sector.
‚ÄúCrypto startups would choose investors that can help connect them to exchanges and tokenomic experts, so their tokens can go global. They will be looking at what crypto ecosystem the investor has,‚Äù Umar says.
This is particularly true of early-stage companies, says Alex Svanevik, co-founder and CEO of Nansen. The crypto analytics startup, for example, sought crypto-native investors for its seed round, hoping they could help the company grow within the industry. In its most recent round, however, Nansen onboarded strategic partners to grow ‚Äúbeyond the crypto bubble and the broader market.‚Äù These include top conventional VCs such as Accel, GIC, Andreessen Horowitz, Tiger Global, and SCB 10X.

Svanevik believes that many tech VCs have been slow to move into the crypto sector due to several factors, including regulatory issues as well as a lack of understanding of emerging business models. However, he sees change on the horizon, as 2021 was a tipping point for mainstream VC investment in the space.
Pintu‚Äôs Soetoyo shares this view. Having worked with Intudo and ‚Äì more recently ‚Äì Lightspeed Venture Partners, Soetoyo says non-specialized investors can help grow and scale businesses in valuable ways.
‚ÄúMany non-specialized investors have taken a strong interest in crypto or have even established crypto-specific funds, so I believe we‚Äôll see more involvement from them as well,‚Äù he says.
Community over capital
One of the first mainstream VCs in Southeast Asia to set up a crypto fund is Openspace Ventures. The Singapore-based firm ‚Äì which counts Gojek, Biofourmis, and Halodoc as portfolio companies ‚Äì launched a US$30 million crypto-focused fund earlier this month. Called Ocular Crypto, the fund invests in fund managers and Web3 projects, including those that deal with DeFi (decentralized finance), the creator/ownership economy, infrastructure, and tooling.
While it has a global mandate, Ocular says Openspace‚Äôs deep roots in Southeast Asia put it in a unique position to tap into the region‚Äôs young crypto ecosystem.
Another VC firm that has also embraced Web3 dealmaking, albeit through a different route, is Indonesia‚Äôs BRI Ventures, the VC arm of state-owned bank BRI. The VC firm struck a partnership with Binance-backed crypto exchange Tokocrypto in January to launch the first blockchain-focused accelerator in Indonesia. Successful applicants will not only have access to business mentoring but will also receive partnership support and investment opportunities from BRI Ventures, Tokocrypto, and their affiliates.

For aspiring crypto startups, working with local VCs like BRI Ventures will help them unearth more local use cases, as well as network and market access, says BRI Ventures CEO Nicko Widjaja.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs true that the very nature of Web3 startups makes it easier to be global from day one. But the early group of adopters can be local. This is where the knowledge of local VCs is much more valuable,‚Äù says Widjaja, whose firm invested in YGG SEA last year.
Ultimately, the status quo remains: Full-fledged crypto VCs have a strong grip on the ecosystem and access to deal flow. For example, the team at Singapore-based Blockchain Founders Fund speaks at an average of three to four blockchain or emerging tech events to increase deal flow, according to its principal Tobias Bauer. Additionally, the firm also receives references to high-quality projects from its over 70 existing portfolio companies.
Amid such domination, it becomes important for non-specialized VCs to win the attention, respect, and approval of founders. The best way to do this is through being involved and immersed in the community, Widjaja says.
Ocular vice president Amy Zhao seconds this view.

732155,2022-02-11T02:00:02,Navigating the changing digital advertising landscape,"With the pandemic pushing consumption online, digital marketing has reached its peak. More money is being spent on digital marketing and advertising than ever before, and it has overtaken all other formats for the first time in 2021.
Before digital, advertising was more art than science: Marketers were heavily reliant on ‚Äúimpressions‚Äù as a measurement of an ad‚Äôs effectiveness based on how many times it‚Äôs seen.
‚ÄúEverything was based on an impression, like how many people drove past a billboard,‚Äù observes Michael Hahn, CEO and founder of digital advertising platform ReverseAds.

ReverseAds founder and CEO Michael Hahn / Photo credit: ReverseAds

While impressions are important because they signal the beginning of an interaction with a customer, marketers soon dropped cost-per-click (CPC) models and moved towards those optimized for actual sales or conversions.
These new ‚Äúattribution-based‚Äù models were made possible by the emergence of cookie and tracking technologies like Facebook Pixel and Google‚Äôs AdWords, which allow marketers to glean specific consumer data.
A complicated space
However, the evolution of adtech has led to its fair share of problems.
Greater awareness around data privacy has led the industry to shift away from third-party cookies, presenting an entirely different challenge for advertisers left in the dark.
Another problem is attribution, a key metric that helps advertisers figure out how to charge their clients by tracking where certain actions occur during a user journey. The issue is further compounded by the sheer number of digital ad players out there, as well as factors like multi-click attribution, click fraud, and accidental clicks.
However, some of the biggest challenges facing marketers can be summed up in two names: Facebook and Google.
Over the last 20 years, these companies have become the ‚Äúdefault option.‚Äù In 2021 alone, these tech titans accounted for over half of global digital ad revenues outside of China, alongside retail giant Amazon.
Hahn likens Facebook and Google to ‚Äúpublic utilities‚Äù because of their ubiquity. With their huge digital footprints, Facebook and Google are continuously engaging users across other platforms such as Instagram and YouTube.
A digital ad duopoly
As a result of this reality, both companies have the power to set prices, resulting in reduced returns for advertisers. This duopoly also has little incentive to make changes to their platforms that benefit anyone but themselves.
Google and Facebook‚Äôs ‚Äúwalled gardens‚Äù ‚Äì environments where the platforms control users‚Äô access to content and services ‚Äì are yielding fewer advantages for advertisers than before. Social platforms like Facebook don‚Äôt drive actual product sales, especially for considered purchases like business-to-business services, cars, or luxury goods, which require more thought and involve a high degree of financial or emotional risk and reward.
‚ÄúConsumers browsing social media aren‚Äôt in the mindset to make serious purchases,‚Äù points out Hahn.

In fact, even a search maverick like Google isn‚Äôt meeting the needs of brands because a lot of search activity is moving elsewhere, such as ecommerce platforms.
Another issue marketers face is the pricing models imposed by Google and Facebook. Facebook frequently changes its algorithm, making it difficult for brands to reach their target audiences. In turn, this uncertainty essentially forces advertisers to buy the algorithm‚Äôs favor.
Meanwhile, Google‚Äôs bidding-based model drives advertisers to pay a fee for every gleaned impression ‚Äì without the promise of conversions. ReverseAds says that some of its clients like German automaker BMW have had to spend up to half of their budgets just to ensure that they stay ahead of the competition in terms of search rankings.
‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt have to do so in a just internet,‚Äù says Hahn. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost like paying the internet gods to allow your brand‚Äôs name to come up.‚Äù
The first true alternative to Google
From the beginning, ReverseAds was designed to be a true alternative to Google in the face of privacy concerns.
‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt want to build a product that was dependent on tracking users‚Äô every movement online,‚Äù he recalls.
ReverseAds‚Äô ‚Äúcookie-less‚Äù technology leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to predict consumers‚Äô behavior before presenting ads at the right time and the right place.
Hahn explains that ReverseAds opens up opportunities ‚Äúafter search,‚Äù which refers to the time after a user‚Äôs first keyword search, when they leave the search engine and enter the open web. Advertising on the open web is based on predictions of the user‚Äôs path to purchase made via ReverseAds‚Äôs patented Keywords Assignment Algorithm.
‚ÄúThe step after search ‚Äì after you leave Google‚Äôs properties ‚Äì is just as important or even more so in the purchase process for long-consideration products,‚Äù Hahn says.

In a head-to-head comparison, the cost of purchasing the same keywords in after search is roughly half of what Google charges, leading to lower prices for advertisers for an equal amount of value. Furthermore, instead of relying on traditional metrics like CPC, ReverseAds has pioneered the ‚Äúcost-per-intent‚Äù (CPIn) model‚Äã‚Äã, where advertisers are only charged for quality clicks.
Hahn explains that by using CPIn, ReverseAds can measure the quality of a click by applying the Internet Advertising Bureau‚Äôs (IAB‚Äôs) rigorous 22-second standard, where a click is only measured if a user spends at least that much time on a website, visits three pages on the site, or reaches 100% scroll depth on the landing page, enabling meaningless or accidental engagement to be automatically weeded out.
He says that the CPIn model allows brands ‚Äúto grow a big database of users who actually demonstrate real intent without paying extremely high rates just to buy on a conversion basis.‚Äù The firm also focuses on ensuring ads are shown to users at a time when they are receptive to them.
Changing the ad experience
As the industry gradually matures, Hahn emphasizes the increased desire for privacy and personalization in the internet experience of users, which in turn will lead to an ‚Äúad-less‚Äù future.
‚ÄúI know that sounds strange, but we think advertising has to stop being advertising,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúUsers are going to continue demanding their privacy online, and advertising is going to have to be a benefit, not a nuisance.‚Äù
Hahn also predicts that customers‚Äô disdain for ads will naturally push more advertisers to innovate new kinds of predictive engagement models that reimagine the core of advertising itself.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre really working to change the experience of what an ad is,‚Äù he concludes.

ReverseAds is building the world‚Äôs first true alternative to Google search ads by leveraging artificial intelligence and predictive keyword assignment technology to help businesses reclaim their online advertising ROI and connect with valuable, high-intent users.

The food delivery major saw total comprehensive losses (its loss after tax) for Q3 of the financial year ending (FYE) March 2022 narrow to just 998 million rupees (US$13.3 million), compared with a loss of US$51.7 million in the same quarter last year. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, its net loss shrank by more than 77%.
The firm‚Äôs adjusted revenue also surged 78% year-over-year to US$190 million. However, the company noted that its revenue stayed at the same level as in the preceding quarter (Q2 FYE 2022).
However, its adjusted EBITDA more than doubled to US$36 million in Q3 from US$16 million last year.
‚ÄúWe are currently well capitalized with US$1.7 billion cash on our balance sheet, and we don‚Äôt envisage raising cash in the foreseeable future,‚Äù the company wrote in its release. It plans to inject that cash into its core food businesses and its quick commerce efforts.

The funding will support Brick‚Äôs vision of powering the next generation of fintech companies with easy-to-implement, cost-effective, and inclusive fintech infrastructure. The startup is also looking to recruit senior local talents in the geographies where it operates to localize its offerings.
Brick was co-founded in 2020 by Gavin Tan, an early employee at Singapore-based neobank Aspire and Deepak Malhotra, co-founder of Indian fintech unicorn Slice.
Brick builds APIs for tech companies, making it easier for them to offer payment, credit, investment, and insurance products to their consumers by connecting those platforms with hyperlocal data sources. For example, if a user wants to take out a loan, Brick‚Äôs technology can immediately connect the platform with the user‚Äôs financial account or gather mobile wallet or employment data to help process the loan application.
The startup currently has nearly 50 paying clients, including Indonesia‚Äôs Sinarmas Group and Astra Financial. The company supports more than 13 million API calls and almost 1 million consumers each month. It will roll out in Singapore and the Philippines later this year.

What‚Äôs more important, the startup business idea or go-to-market strategy?

Sustaining the success of a startup is like cooking a complicated stew: You need to add in many ingredients to get that special flavor. For startups to keep thriving, it usually boils down to two main elements: the product idea and the go-to-market (GTM) strategy. The question is, which of the two is more important?
For a product idea to have real and sustainable change as well as success at scale, it requires the right GTM strategy, and startups can pick up tips on creating one from Fast Forward with HPE. The initiative is a multistage B2B startup competition from Hewlett Packard Enterprise that‚Äôs specially crafted to help scale and grow early-stage tech startups across Asia Pacific. It wants to foster a culture of growth, scalability, and sustenance by providing the next generation of digital disruptors with GTM strategy development and ecosystem support.
Tune in to watch the third and final episode of the competition, in which the four finalist startups go through one last round of grilling by the judges to determine the winners.

Premium summary
Will the shoe fit?

I used to think that Carousell was only good for selling used clothes or other smaller second-hand items. But I was pleasantly surprised to find that it had way more to offer than that. With the acquisition of a proptech platform in the cards, Carousell‚Äôs reach could grow even further. The move could become the cherry on top of the company‚Äôs expansion gambit into other markets such as automobiles and luxury goods.


Show me the money: According to two people familiar with the matter, Carousell‚Äôs acquisition of 99 Group could take the form of a US$150 million cash-and-stock deal. Should it happen, the deal could take 99 Group‚Äôs valuation far above its current standing of US$83.6 million, according to VentureCap Insights. Carousell, on the other hand, last saw its valuation pegged at a little over US$1 billion.


Beefing up: According to one of the sources, Carousell‚Äôs desire to strengthen its portfolio ahead of a potential US listing spurred the company to engage in talks of the acquisition, which could happen as early as this quarter. This is just the latest in Carousell‚Äôs string of expansion efforts, which includes the acquisition of several firms such as Ox Street, Caarly, OneShift, OLX Philippines, and 701Search.


The other side of the coin: The deal could prove especially fruitful for 99 Group too. With this sale, the company would have the required backing to boost its expansion in markets such as Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam. Its sale to Carousell could also help it shore up its competitive advantages against its rival PropertyGuru, which operates in the same markets and plans to go public in June via a SPAC merger with Bridgetown 2 Holdings.

Setting foot in India

UK-based Revolut is looking to enter India with a bang, having set aside nearly US$45 million for its expansion into the country. The company will be using its war chest for product development and operating expenses, as well as to hire nearly 300 employees by the end of this year.


Money, money, money: The fintech company specializes in mobile banking, card payments, money remittance, and foreign exchange. Last year, it raised US$800 million in a funding round co-led by SoftBank and Tiger Global, which took the company‚Äôs valuation to US$33 billion.


A full meal: For its first course in India, the firm intends to lead with its flagship payments and remittance product, which will allow customers to transfer money within the country and abroad. Next, Revolut will launch a trading product, enabling users to invest in both domestic and international markets. And finally, the company will introduce its lending service for both B2B and B2C consumers.


Stepping out: As part of its expansion, Revolut is also building a product and engineering hub in India, the first time it‚Äôs doing so outside its home base in the UK. This hub will help the company serve India and the rest of the Asia-Pacific region ‚Äì the firm currently has a presence in Singapore, Australia, and Japan, and it is also looking to launch in New Zealand in the future.

732260,2022-02-10T09:17:43,Exclusive: Bukalapak co-founders back üáÆüá© B2B fintech startup amid funding spree,"Init 6, the VC firm led by Bukalapak co-founders Achmad Zaky and Nugroho ‚ÄúXinuc‚Äù Herucahyono, has invested in Monit, an Indonesian B2B fintech startup. The details of the deal were not disclosed, but Monit said it has also raised funding from 1982 Ventures and an unnamed VC, taking its total seed funding to a seven-figure sum.
Monit describes itself as an ‚Äúintegrated experience,‚Äù combining payments, expenses, cash, and corporate cards. In a conversation with Tech in Asia, Init 6 likened Monit to US-based giant Brex and expects the Indonesian startup to be a ‚Äúgamechanger in the B2B fintech sector.‚Äù

Monit co-founders Rizki Aditya (left) and Teddy Tjahjadi / Photo credit: Monit

Zaky, who built Bukalapak from scratch to become an ecommerce unicorn, says he and his team were often left ‚Äúfrustrated‚Äù when managing the company‚Äôs digital expenses. While corporate credit cards are the ideal solution, they are difficult to obtain for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) ‚Äì like Bukalapak was in its early days.
‚ÄúFrom that experience, we believe that many companies, specifically SMBs, face the same problem,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúMonit can help them become more productive and efficient by providing an all-in-one expense management system, including corporate credit cards for payment.‚Äù
The Monit deal follows a quietly busy 2021 for Init 6. While only four deals were publicly announced, the VC firm says it made 15 investments in total.
Banking services, minus the hassle
Businesses can use Monit to pay for bills, manage reimbursements and disbursements, and issue corporate credit cards. The company was established by Rizki Aditya and Teddy Tjahjadi, who both had stints at startups in the US.
Monit, which mostly targets ecommerce players and tech companies, only started acquiring clients in January. But in order to roll out its corporate credit card offering, the startup has sealed strategic partnership deals with major card networks Mastercard and Visa as well as regional bank issuers CIMB Niaga and United Overseas Bank.

Aside from banks, several startups In Indonesia provide related solutions for businesses. HR platform Mekari, for example, has launched Mekari Pay, which gives companies access to all payment methods via a single digital wallet. Meanwhile, peer-to-peer transfer startup Flip has also tapped into the B2B space, where it simplifies mass disbursement and international fund transfers for companies.
Monit, however, seems to be the only one focusing solely on the banking needs of SMBs.
‚ÄúMonit is not trying to be a bank, yet we are more than just an accounts payable tool. We see the future as a marketplace where businesses can discover, manage, and use multiple financial instruments ‚Äì bank transfer, cards, savings, etc. ‚Äì powered by a single experience,‚Äù says Rizki.
The company concedes that it does draw its inspiration from Brex, which grew to a billion-dollar business in just two years and is now valued at over US$12 billion. However, Rizki says the two companies differ in their approach. While Brex encourages businesses to spend more by incentivizing employees with point-based rewards, Monit‚Äôs software is designed to help companies spend less, thus enabling them to generate more profit.
The fintech startup will use the proceeds from the seed funding to hire more talent and develop its products. Rizki says the next product will be focused on treasury, so Monit will partner with banks and financial institutions to help companies get an investment return from their idle cash.
Silently prolific
For Init 6, Monit counts as its second publicly announced investment this year. In January, the VC firm said it has backed Showwcase, a developer community platform based in the US.
Though Init 6 only unveiled four deals (Codemi, Eduka, Moni, and ID CloudHost) in 2021, the firm says the total was 15. Among the investments that went unannounced were cloud management startup Awanio and content creator platform Trakteer.
This year, Init 6 is looking to double its existing portfolios.

Init 6 founders Nugroho ‚ÄúXinuc‚Äù Herucahyono and Achmad Zaky (third and fourth from left) with the team from IDCloudHost / Photo credit: IDCloudHost

The firm says that it is still investing out of the pockets of its founders. Nevertheless, Zaky and Xinuc considering to elevate the fund to a conventional limited partner-general partner (LP-GP) structure.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still deploying our own money, because we believe that skin in the game is very important in this VC ecosystem. However, we also believe that if we want to go big and far, we will need more external partners,‚Äù Zaky explains.
Going bigger and further would be a necessity for Init 6, given the increasingly crowded and competitive venture capital game in Indonesia.
But given that both Zaky and Xinuc are proven local unicorn builders, perhaps that‚Äôs enough to set them apart from almost all other VCs in the region.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had an experience building a startup from scratch until it became a unicorn. That experience, we think, could be the most valuable value-add that we can share to our portfolio companies,‚Äù Zaky says.",Ardi Wirdana,Putra Muskita and Eileen C.

Delivered every Thursday via email and through the Tech in Asia website, this free newsletter breaks down the biggest stories and trends in ecommerce. If you‚Äôre not a subscriber, get access by registering here.
Hi there,
2 million.
That‚Äôs the number of shipments Indonesian startup J&amp;T Express processed per day in 2020, according to research by venture builder Momentum Works.
Despite achieving a hefty US$20 billion valuation within six years of launch and heading for an IPO in Hong Kong, J&amp;T Express hasn‚Äôt received the attention it deserves. It‚Äôs one of the few Indonesian tech companies that aggressively target overseas markets ‚Äì a trick that even super app Gojek hasn‚Äôt mastered.
Ecommerce logistics is a tough nut to crack, especially in last-mile delivery. Competition is intense and, generally, it‚Äôs hard for logistics players to stand out. It‚Äôs game over if these companies don‚Äôt have the scale.
J&amp;T Express, however, has one crucial advantage: Its roots can be traced to Oppo, the Chinese smartphone company. J&amp;T stands for Jet and Tony, named after its co-founders. Notably, Jet Lee was also Oppo‚Äôs Indonesia CEO and Tony Chen founded the smartphone maker in 2004.
The Oppo network has helped J&amp;T expand regionally across Southeast Asia and establish a strong foothold in China, a ‚Äúred ocean‚Äù market.
But J&amp;T needs to find new sources of growth. Next on its radar are the Middle East and Latin America, where it can lean on a potential partnership with fellow Southeast Asian firm Shopee.
Is J&amp;T Express‚Äô global expansion the real deal or does it merely serve the narrative for its upcoming IPO? In this week‚Äôs Big Story, my colleague, Jofie Yordan, takes a look at all the cards that J&amp;T Express has to play with to survive and thrive.
Our Hot Take this week highlights the power of the marketplace, which in the case of Amazon has grown to become one of its biggest cash cows in 2021. But the question remains as to whether this will tempt the US tech giant to take a crack at Asia again.

J&amp;T Express made waves by capitalizing on its ties to Oppo and Shopee. But will that be enough to drive global expansion?

THE HOT TAKEAmazon marketplace‚Äôs indisputable power

Here‚Äôs what happened:

Amazon‚Äôs third-party sellers now account for 25% of U.S. ecommerce, clocking a gross merchandise value (GMV) of US$390 billion in 2021, according to estimates from MarketplacePulse.
The figure has even surpassed that of Amazon Retail (GMV of US$210 billion in 2021), which handles goods sold by Amazon directly to consumers.
The Amazon Marketplace consists of millions of online businesses worldwide that sell through Amazon. While they have delivered stellar growth in recent years, these businesses are subject to rules and restrictions set by Amazon.

Here‚Äôs our take:
While Amazon Web Services, the firm‚Äôs cloud computing service, has received high praise from analysts, Amazon Marketplace remains the most profitable part of the ecommerce giant‚Äôs retail operations. In this segment, Amazon doesn‚Äôt own any inventory and receives a hefty fee on the nearly $400 billion in gross merchandise value it handles, as this Forbes analysis pointed out.
Despite the impressive numbers, Amazon‚Äôs success in ecommerce is not global, with around 60% of its US$469.8 billion in net sales in 2021 coming from North America alone.
Notably, it‚Äôs not the market leader in any Asian market.
Even though it was an early entrant in China, Amazon failed to overcome the stiff competition from Chinese giants Alibaba and JD.com, and eventually shut down its Chinese domestic ecommerce business in 2019.
In Singapore ‚Äì the only Southeast Asian country where Amazon operates ‚Äì it‚Äôs trailing behind Sea Group‚Äôs Shopee and Alibaba‚Äôs Lazada both in terms of web traffic and app traffic, according to iPrice‚Äôs data for Q3, 2021. Moreover, in late 2019, Amazon also skipped out on an opportunity to gain a foothold in Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam after the firm ceased talks to acquire a stake in super app Gojek.
However, with recent signs of significant momentum in Amazon‚Äôs third-party marketplace, is the time ripe for Amazon to have another serious crack at Asian markets where it has struggled?
In Southeast Asia, Shopee and Tokopedia have demonstrated the importance of implementing the consumer-to-consumer model from the start, which some analysts say is more suitable for acquiring buyers and sellers quickly in emerging markets.

There are hurdles aplenty, but the rise of third-party sellers globally might mean it‚Äôs time for Amazon to up its game in Asia.
Still, small businesses fear being priced out and Tech in Asia previously analyzed why the multiplatform strategy ‚Äì selling both on marketplaces and independent websites ‚Äì is the way to go in Southeast Asia.
For Asia-based sellers, Amazon‚Äôs biggest appeal is its ability to connect them with global buyers.
‚ÄúOur success depends on the success of our selling partners,‚Äù an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement to Tech in Asia. The person added that the company is committed to ‚Äúhelping sellers grow and reach a global audience easily‚Äù through its 20 country stores around the world, giving them access to over 200 million of Amazon Prime‚Äôs paying members worldwide.
However, established regional ecommerce players like Shopee are well stocked to compete. Shopee‚Äôs significant inroads in Europe and Latin America can give third-party sellers another window to reach customers overseas.
Amazon often thrives on countering skepticism. So it‚Äôs hard to see why it doesn‚Äôt want to grab a bigger slice of Asia‚Äôs US$2 trillion ecommerce market.

Medici‚Äôs existing investor Insignia Venture Partners also participated in the round.

Medici aims to make healthcare and insurance more accessible and affordable for people in Vietnam. The startup said it has partnered with more than 50 hospitals and clinics to provide health-screening services. It also hosts an in-house doctor-influencer network as well as a drugs and supplements marketplace.
In July 2021, Medici expanded into the insurance business after securing a brokerage license from Vietnam‚Äôs Ministry of Finance. The company claims to be the first tech startup in the country to do so.
Since then, its insurance segment has recorded a 100% month-on-month growth. The company has also appointed Vu Ba Tuyen, former deputy CEO of life insurance firm Hanwha Life, as Medici‚Äôs deputy CEO to spearhead its insurance business.
Medici was founded by Duc Anh Ngo, a former acquisition manager at Grab, in 2019.
The company plans to use the fresh capital to scale up its insurance agent network and improve its tech. It also aims to expand its healthcare ecosystem to include more specialties by onboarding more influencer doctors. It also plans to develop a wider selection of healthcare products in its marketplace and ramp up hiring across all verticals.

Despite its initially unimposing presence, the online shopping platform quickly clawed its way through the ranks. Bolstered by Garena‚Äôs war chest, Sea‚Äôs timely listing, and Tencent‚Äôs backing, Shopee was able to outspend its competition at every turn, drawing customers to its platform like flies to honey.

732196,2022-02-10T05:50:28,Zimplistic flips to a profit in 2021 after troubles,"Zimplistic, the Singapore-based startup behind the fully-automated flatbread maker Rotimatic, told Tech in Asia that it has turned operating profitable for the first time in 2021. The company said that its revenue has ‚Äúincreased substantially,‚Äù but it declined to give specific numbers.
While Zimplistic didn‚Äôt divulge details of its financials for 2021, this comes as a turnaround two years after it burned into its cash reserves due to mounting losses.

In October 2020, investment vehicle Light Ray Holdings acquired Zimplistic after its previous investors rushed for the exit door. While the ownership changed, the management remained under husband and wife founder duo Rishi Israni and Pranoti Nagarkar Israni. The company‚Äôs turmoil drove the founders and new owners to create a plan for financial sustainability in 2021.
‚ÄúOnce the new investors came in, we all had a series of sessions to zero in on the execution plan going forward,‚Äù Pranoti tells Tech in Asia. This included improvements on its product, investments in its user experience, its plan for a launch in India, and its strategy for consumables.
A rush that led to regret
In 2018, Zimplistic was battling mounting losses and falling revenue, according to its regulatory filings.

At the same time, the company was burning through its cash reserves. The net cash used in its operating activities during that year was US$19.9 million, while it had raised a total of only US$11.6 million by 2018, according to VentureCap Insights data.
The rush to do a full rollout of the Rotimatic product seemed to be the main cause of the startup‚Äôs losses.
‚ÄúWith the benefit of hindsight, we can say that the decision of selling 21,000 machines in our first year was not the best thing to do. I think we were overenthusiastic about the launch and in hindsight we should have tempered our enthusiasm about taking a unique product to a market and have had a balanced approach towards a rollout,‚Äù says Pranoti.
She explains that it was supply chain costs that impacted Zimplistic, as the company did not scale it in the first year of Rotimatic‚Äôs launch. ‚ÄúOperationally, it takes time to set up and scale the supply chain,‚Äù she adds.

Pranoti shares that if the company were to launch the product again, it would do a staggered rollout with a subset of geographies. She says that this would have led to a better experience for all the stakeholders, especially the users.
To make matters worse, the company was pummeled by the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdowns in 2020, which disrupted its supply chains. Because of this, Zimplistic slowed down manufacturing at its plant in Malaysia.
The startup shares that it still deals with high supply chain costs as well as bottlenecks from the large demand that its shipping partners experience. ‚ÄúRaw material is still in shortage, so the challenge for my manufacturing and procurement team is to constantly ensure the lead time can meet production schedules. In some cases, we have had to work to find alternative molders or manufacturers of parts as the supplier shut down operations,‚Äù Pranoti adds.
The pandemic not only impacted Zimplistic‚Äôs supply chain of raw materials, but also the delivery and returns of its products.
The startup offers a seven-day replacement guarantee for any hardware issues that its customers face across its 20 markets. It also doesn‚Äôt have a service center. The team analyzes the Rotimatic machine to know if it is a hardware or software problem.
While the team can solve any software problems remotely, the company offers a replacement of the machine for hardware issues.
Units that are returned to the company are refurbished and resold as ‚Äúremanufactured‚Äù products at a lower price. While a brand new Rotimatic is priced at US$1,299, the refurbished machine is sold at US$999.
Slowing the cash burn
Zimplistic‚Äôs losses and cash burn were reduced in 2019 and 2020.


Similarly, its loss before interest and tax dropped by half to US$10.5 million in 2019 and was further reduced by over 2x to US$4.8 million in 2020.
The startup achieved this by reducing its staff count by over half. It currently has about 50 people across its offices in Singapore and India, including outsourced customer service agents ‚Äì a sharp drop from its headcount of 110 earlier.
Zimplistic is now looking to expand its engineering, marketing, and customer experience teams.
The company also reduced its raw material costs without impacting the quality of the Rotimatic. The company says that its new owner, Light Ray Holdings, supported Zimplistic in this regard, as the investment vehicle brought in its existing contacts and relationships to help the startup manage optimization of raw material costs.
The Singapore-based firm also applied automation to reduce costs. ‚ÄúFor example, we designed an auto troubleshooter for users to use to help improve the user experience and have a faster turnaround time,‚Äù adds Pranoti.
While operating losses improved, the company‚Äôs revenue took a beating as it fell by 5x from 2018 to 2020. In 2020, the figure stood at just US$3.9 million
Besides cutting costs, Zimplistic further improved its customer experience by working closely with its call center partner to enhance agent training, processes, policies, and tools. Pranoti says that this increased word of mouth and helped in conversions.
According to the company, Rotimatic is now in more than 75,000 households across different markets.
Homecoming for the Rotimatic?
Zimplistic plans to make an entry into the Indian market, the home of the roti or flatbread.
The company says that it has seen a surge in interest for the Rotimatic in India during the pandemic. Pranoti shares that the startup became aware of this as people from India were either buying the product from other countries or having it shipped to India by friends and relatives overseas.

The company has already received pre-orders for the Rotimatic in India and will soon begin delivery of the products.
The rise in demand from India may be attributed to the pandemic restricting access to cooks into wealthier households and the demand for freshly-made rotis. While ready-to-eat rotis are available in the market, there are many who prefer the healthier option of having a roti made from scratch with their own ingredients.
‚ÄúRoti is a staple for more than 150 million families in India, of which we believe that 11 million would be directly an addressable market size for a solution like Rotimatic that is fully automatic and one of its kind. The only alternative that the consumer has right now is frozen, ready-to-eat, or half-cooked rotis sold in supermarkets or restaurants,‚Äù explains Pranoti.
The Rotimatic is sold at 111,000 rupees (about US$1,483) in India, which is a bit higher than its selling price elsewhere due to the country‚Äôs 18% goods and service tax charges. However, even when excluding these taxes, the price is still expensive for an individual in India earning a middle-income salary who is looking to buy a cooking appliance.
In comparison, a multifunction oven is considered the highest-priced cooking appliance in the country, but it costs nearly half of what a Rotimatic is priced at.
This means that Zimplistic‚Äôs product is meant for a much higher-income household earning around 250,000 rupees to 300,000 rupees (US$3,300 to US$4,000) per month, which is why the company is targeting families with two earning members aged between 35 and 45.
‚ÄúWe are shipping across India, so it will be interesting to see the demand from the metros versus the rest of India,‚Äù says Pranoti.
She adds that 2022 for Zimplistic is all about establishing the brand in India and improving the user experience in all markets. The company is looking to expand into more countries once Covid restrictions are eased and the after-effects of supply chain challenges are resolved.

Though big tech corporations have a ton of resources at their disposal, many of them suffer from the same problems as their non-tech counterparts. Staffing skews big, and they often move slower, thanks to the many processes and rules at play.

Goodbye, corporate life
For Rene Tan, the head of pre-sales for smart city infrastructure at Envision Digital ‚Äì a provider of sustainability software ‚Äì joining the startup gave him an opportunity to explore new and emerging technologies at a larger scale.
In 2015, he left a job at Malaysian satellite television company Astro for telecommunications firm Singtel to pursue bigger opportunities and a role in the island state‚Äôs developing tech economy, focused on emerging technology such as the internet of things (IoT). Soon after, he joined Envision, lured by the firm‚Äôs track record as the biggest renewable energy platform in the world that uses artificial intelligence of things (AIoT).

‚ÄúI was in awe because at Singtel, we were still figuring out where we were going with IoT ‚Äì Envision was already there,‚Äù he says.
Tan was attracted to Envision‚Äôs technological capabilities and active commitment to the global climate change agenda, but the biggest draw was the firm‚Äôs ‚Äúclarity in direction‚Äù when it came to its solutions‚Äô specific domain at the intersection of AIoT and sustainability.
‚ÄúOftentimes in technology, the company is just meant to be a broad platform that allows for various domains and industries to come in,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúHowever, this means you end up being a master of none. Envision has this specific connection to sustainability, which gives it focus and helps to drive its growth.‚Äù
Coming in from the outside
For Han Jiamin, the team lead of ecommerce logistics community platform Parcel Monitor, startups provided an opportunity for her to make a pivot from a staid professional career into an exciting role in tech. Parcel Monitor is a unit under package-tracking startup Parcel Perform.
Armed with a law degree, Han worked for a year and a half at a major law firm in Singapore. However, she soon found that she was more drawn to tech‚Äôs forward-looking perspective, and she made the leap into the industry by joining AI solutions provider Taiger as its seventh employee.
‚ÄúI started in sales, but, being in a startup, I also did marketing, events, and was also co-legal counsel,‚Äù she recalls.

Han Jiamin, team lead of Parcel Monitor, Parcel Perform / Photo credit: Parcel Perform

After Taiger, Han worked with integration-as-a-service provider Dell Boomi to get experience with working in a big organization. However, she found that the highly-specialized corporate culture didn‚Äôt suit her.
‚ÄúYou lose that connection with technology, which is what drew me to the tech space from the start,‚Äù she muses. ‚ÄúI have to be excited about a company‚Äôs value proposition and the problem it‚Äôs trying to solve in order to join, and I wanted to be part of that development process.‚Äù
Soon after, Han joined Parcel Perform, and she shares that she was drawn to the startup because of its clear value proposition of improving the logistics experience, as well as its status as an early-stage startup. For her, the company‚Äôs nascent stage meant there were more opportunities to grow, learn, and contribute.
‚ÄúThe company is young and growing fast, so there will be plenty of opportunities for you to make an impact,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúA year in a startup can give you so much more knowledge and experience compared to the same amount of time in a specialized role in a large organization.‚Äù
Wearing many hats
Despite its reputation as a ‚Äúsexy industry,‚Äù as Han puts it, there is no doubt that startup life is grueling. Both Tan and Han say that their forays into startup culture were characterized by heavy workloads and the need to play multiple roles.
Tan doesn‚Äôt just work on presales solution marketing for Envision, but also product innovation, go-to-market strategization, and project implementation. Similarly, at Parcel Perform, Han not only acts as the team lead for Parcel Monitor as she is also involved in product development, content, marketing, and partnership strategy.
While wearing many hats in a business is tiring, Han sees this as an opportunity to learn more about a startup and develop quickly.

Han with her colleagues at Parcel Perform in 2020, prior to the Covid-19 pandemic / Photo credit: Parcel Perform

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt have any formal education or experience in product management, but this also made my learning process a lot more focused and productive,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI learned based on what I needed to apply immediately.‚Äù
Tan echoes Han‚Äôs views, saying that working across functions has given him a lot of opportunities to grow, though there are some drawbacks to running a tight ship with few resources.
‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt have an individual step out or you disrupt the entire process,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúA lot of us had to pick up the slack, and I personally learned a lot from plugging holes everywhere.‚Äù
‚ÄúFail fast, learn fast, scale fast‚Äù
Despite their different routes, both Han and Tan point to similar benefits from working at startups. For one, startups are better at making speedy decisions and pivoting from failed endeavors, unlike large corporations that prize perfect planning over all.
‚ÄúThe benefit of startups is that decisions are made fast, then we iterate and move on,‚Äù Tan says.

Tan with his colleagues at InnovFest Unbound / Photo credit: Envision Digital

‚ÄúWhat I‚Äôve learned is that if it‚Äôs not successful right from the start, it‚Äôs okay,‚Äù Han shares. ‚ÄúFail fast, learn fast ‚Äì but also scale fast.‚Äù
Han also points to the fact that startups offer individuals the flexibility to define their own career paths and professional growth. Parcel Perform opened the door for her to gain the product management experience she lacked, and in doing so, it empowered her to define what her role would be.
As a result of that belief and support, Han was able to launch Parcel Monitor within months of joining.
Tan says that the benefits of his startup experience have been the shift away from a hierarchical corporate culture ‚Äì where processes often trump people ‚Äì and the opportunity to experiment with cutting-edge technology. He‚Äôs had the opportunity to develop new and innovative solutions for many organizations, including multinational corporations and the Singapore government.
A path of many options
Both Tan and Han stress the importance of ensuring that a person‚Äôs values and vision align with those of a startup they plan to join.
‚ÄúStartup life is not easy,‚Äù says Han. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs going to be a lot of uncertainties and undefined processes, but if you‚Äôre able to appreciate where the company is going, it will help you navigate those initial uncertainties.‚Äù
For Tan, Envision‚Äôs commitment to tackling climate change was key to his decision to join, but that might not be the same for others. In his view, an employee needs to first assess the risks of each industry as well as the qualities and leadership of a startup.
‚ÄúYou can make an assessment based on the resumes of the leaders, but I think it‚Äôs also very important to note how purpose-driven the leadership is when working toward its goals,‚Äù he says.
Han advises aspiring startup workers to reach out to people in the space or company before applying to make sure goals and visions are aligned.
‚ÄúI think the best way to understand a startup‚Äôs culture and how it works is really through the people inside,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWhen you talk to people in the industry, you understand what they need, what you‚Äôre missing, and it might be your gateway to your next job as well.‚Äù

731948,2022-02-10T01:55:54,The keys to J&T Express‚Äô rapid global expansion,"Indonesia‚Äôs logistics firms have scaled new heights as the country‚Äôs ecommerce space continues to thrive. But one company appears to be separating itself from the pack: the China-connected J&amp;T Express.
A report from venture builder Momentum Works found that J&amp;T processed 2 million shipments per day in 2020. Not only did it outperform fellow startups like SiCepat Ekspres and Ninja Xpress, but it also outpaced legacy company JNE ‚Äì perhaps a more impressive feat.

But unlike its Indonesian peers, J&amp;T has loftier ambitions. Apart from expanding to other parts of Southeast Asia as well as China, it‚Äôs also eyeing the Middle East and Latin America.
That has led to some eye-popping numbers. The company raised US$2.5 billion at a valuation of US$20 billion in November 2021 as it plans an IPO in Hong Kong sometime this year.

J&amp;T Express employees preparing packages / Photo credit: J&amp;T Express

However, a global expansion remains a tough task. In China, for instance, J&amp;T has to deal with fierce competition from incumbents and a price war that it had ignited.
The co-founder of a J&amp;T competitor observes that there‚Äôs little that separates logistics players from each other ‚Äì at least from an operational or business model standpoint.
‚ÄúFor J&amp;T to keep growing, maybe the only way is to keep expanding to new countries,‚Äù says this source, who asked for anonymity.
Timing and the Oppo factor
There are several key elements driving J&amp;T‚Äôs rapid expansion.
The first one is timing. When J&amp;T was launched in 2015, Indonesia‚Äôs ecommerce gross merchandise value (GMV) was at US$1.78 billion, according to research from Google, Temasek, and Bain &amp; Company. But partnering with industry heavyweights¬† such as Shopee and Tokopedia early on arguably gave J&amp;T a solid foundation once the ecommerce pie grew.
By 2021, the country‚Äôs ecommerce GMV was at US$70 billion ‚Äì an increase of more than 30x over six years, according to the Google-Temasek-Bain report.
The second factor is J&amp;T‚Äôs China roots, which can be traced to smartphone maker Oppo. Jet Lee, J&amp;T‚Äôs founder and first chief executive, was the Indonesia CEO for Oppo. On the flipside, Oppo founder Tony Chen is a J&amp;T co-founder. This could also explain why the company‚Äôs name reportedly stands for ‚ÄúJet and Tony.‚Äù
In fact, J&amp;T Express was initially set up as a logistics company to help Oppo‚Äôs ecommerce operations in Indonesia. Lee previously said that Indonesian logistics was prone to delays and the quality of services was subpar, which is why he and Chen invested 400 billion rupiah (about US$28 million) into J&amp;T.

In turn, the Oppo network has helped J&amp;T expand regionally in Southeast Asia and in China ‚Äì a ‚Äúred ocean‚Äù market that has healthier unit economics for logistics players compared to Indonesia. In China, J&amp;T operates under the name Jitu and has reached 100% nationwide coverage in just seven months, again by leveraging Oppo‚Äôs vast reach.
The anonymous co-founder observes that J&amp;T‚Äôs strategies in pricing, operations, expansion, and marketing are similar to those used by Oppo and other Chinese smartphone brands. By offering prices lower than its competitors‚Äô, J&amp;T gains market share.
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what makes J&amp;T brave and quick to grow,‚Äù the source says. But since logistics is ‚Äúultimately a different game,‚Äù he has doubts about the long-term sustainability of J&amp;T‚Äôs approach. While smartphone firms ‚Äúcan always grow by releasing new phones with new technologies, it‚Äôs not as easy for logistics players,‚Äù he adds.
Indeed, that strategy is apparent in the company‚Äôs entry into China. Six players control 82% of the country‚Äôs express market share, and ecommerce giants like Alibaba and JD.com already have established logistics strategies.

As a relative latecomer, J&amp;T Express had to be bold in order to make an impact. That‚Äôs why it acquired Best Express, an Alibaba logistics partner, at the end of 2021, thus securing a part of the Chinese titan‚Äôs shipping volume.
J&amp;T also used aggressive subsidies, making its shipping rates cheaper than what rivals such as YTO and STO charge. This triggered a frenzied price war that got the attention of China‚Äôs regulators. The local postal administration at Yiwu International Trade City ‚Äì the country‚Äôs biggest wholesale market ‚Äì issued a warning letter to J&amp;T in April 2021, ordering the company to ‚Äúrectify‚Äù its competitive strategy.
Competitors are feeling the regulatory heat as well. The earnings per order of Tongda ‚Äì the nickname for China‚Äôs five biggest ecommerce logistics companies, which are all backed by Alibaba ‚Äì dropped by 20% to 30% after J&amp;T came in, according to the Momentum Works report.

J&amp;T Express‚Äô warehouse / Photo credit: J&amp;T Express

Still, J&amp;T‚Äôs strategy appears to be working. As of January 2021, it has achieved a package delivery volume of over 20 million packages per day, gaining 10% of China‚Äôs logistics market share. The company has grown beyond the Oppo network primarily because of Pinduoduo, which is reportedly responsible for about 80% of J&amp;T‚Äôs shipments.
‚ÄúJ&amp;T Express has partnered with more than 30 ecommerce and short-video platforms to achieve full coverage of China‚Äôs major ecommerce platforms,‚Äù CEO Robin Lo tells Tech in Asia.
Indeed, China is instrumental to J&amp;T‚Äôs global success since what happens in this market would affect the company‚Äôs strategy, plans, or valuation, wrote Momentum Works in its report.
An uphill battle
China aside, J&amp;T is already looking at new frontiers in the Middle East (United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia) and Latin America (starting with Brazil and Mexico).
The Middle East market has ‚Äúgreat potential due to its strong consumption capacity and potential for ecommerce development in the region,‚Äù J&amp;T‚Äôs Lo says.
For example, Saudi Arabia‚Äôs ecommerce market soared by almost 60% from 2019 to 2020, and it‚Äôs now expected to be worth 50 billion riyal (US$13 billion) by 2025, according to a new analysis from Boston Consulting Group.
Recently, J&amp;T announced a US$2 billion investment to set up its Middle East and North Africa (MENA) headquarters in Riyadh. Together with eWTP Arabia Capital and other partners, the firm is looking to build a smart logistics network in the region.

But some in the industry question why J&amp;T has chosen to venture into this market.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think there is much logic to the expansion, other than just to build up the narrative that J&amp;T is a global company,‚Äù says a logistics executive who has worked in both ecommerce and third-party logistics.
Indeed, the size of the Middle East market pales in comparison to Latin America‚Äôs. Brazil‚Äôs ecommerce market alone, for instance, was forecasted to hit US$27.5 billion in 2021.
Perhaps more importantly, going into Latin America also mirrors the strategy of a Southeast Asian ecommerce giant: Shopee.
Shopee also entered Latin America by focusing on the region‚Äôs two biggest markets: Brazil and Mexico. There are enough similarities between the two countries to make implementation relatively straightforward, but based on Tech in Asia‚Äôs analysis, Brazil could even become the biggest market for the platform, beating Indonesia.
Latin Americans also have a higher gross domestic product (GDP) per capita than Southeast Asians do, which means higher purchasing power. And in Brazil at least, the logistics infrastructure still has some ways to go ‚Äì an area where J&amp;T can apply lessons it learned from countries like Indonesia.

Image credit: Timmy Loen

It‚Äôs unclear if J&amp;T and Shopee are planning to team up in Latin America, and spokespersons for both companies declined to comment on the matter. As previously reported, Shopee aims to have one main logistics partner per market. The unnamed logistics co-founder that Tech in Asia spoke to thinks that it‚Äôs ‚Äúvery likely‚Äù that J&amp;T and Shopee will merge in the future.
However, that doesn‚Äôt mean a Middle East expansion is a bad idea. The logistics executive says that perhaps it is ‚Äútime for J&amp;T to venture to other markets without Shopee.‚Äù Oppo‚Äôs market share in the Middle East is small but growing, and maybe J&amp;T is trying to jump in at the right time ‚Äì just like it did in Indonesia.
It may also not matter so much as long as J&amp;T keeps a strong position in China.
‚ÄúThis is where bulk of the ecommerce goods in various categories are manufactured,‚Äù says Vion Yau, head of insights at Momentum Works. ‚ÄúCross-border ecommerce from China [also] offers huge volumes.‚Äù

J&amp;T Express in Saudi Arabia / Photo credit: J&amp;T Express

J&amp;T is developing its cross-border capabilities through a freight forwarding service, and it has already captured a ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù volume, according to Yau. The company also sends seller packages to Amazon FBA warehouses in 23 regions, and the service could come in handy should J&amp;T work with China-based global ecommerce platforms like Shein.
But ultimately, sources say that there isn‚Äôt much that¬† differentiates J&amp;T from other players. The logistics executive who talked to Tech in Asia points out that while there may be operational differences, it‚Äôs generally ‚Äúsimple‚Äù and easy for competitors to emulate.
Similarly, the anonymous logistics co-founder thinks that other Indonesian players can also expand globally ‚Äì as long as they get the right backing. Perhaps global expansion is the only way to grow their numbers, particularly for J&amp;T. Nevertheless, a big question awaits players who take this route: Is it sustainable?",Jofie Yordan,Putra Muskita and Eileen C. Ang,0,"['Analysis', 'Ecommerce', 'Premium Content']",True,True,7

Hello reader,
‚ÄúSynergy‚Äù is what corporate folk (and financial journalists) use to refer to the benefits of collaboration between companies. I recall beads of sweat rolling down my forehead the first time I came across the fancy word in my early days as a reporter. Fret not, though!
As per Investopedia, synergy stands for the idea that the value and performance of two companies combined will be greater than the sum of each on their own. In other words, if the situation permits, working together is better than working alone.
These synergies form a key line of reasoning behind Bukalapak‚Äôs US$83 million deal to buy a 12.05% stake in CT Corp‚Äôs Allo Bank. ‚ÄúThe impact on Bukalapak doesn‚Äôt seem to be direct. It‚Äôs more about synergies to leverage multiple other relationships, especially for the sake of Mitra Bukalapak transactions,‚Äù says Aldi Adrian Hartanto, vice president of investments at MDI Ventures.
Bukalapak‚Äôs arrival in Indonesia‚Äôs digital banking scene has only taken the competition up a notch. In our premium story pick today, we bring you the low-down on what drove Bukalapak‚Äôs entry into the fiercely competitive digibank arena.
Today we look at:

Reaping rewards synergies

Image credit: Timmy Loen

On the face of it, working together for a better outcome sounds like a simple task with great benefits. While it might be so among individuals, it‚Äôs different for corporations. Collaboration among companies requires diligent implementation and coordination on a lot of moving parts to be successful.
Synergies do not magically appear when the ink on the deal sheet has dried. From tweaking internal business processes to altering in-house technological infrastructure, Bukalapak has to do it all before enjoying the benefits of its Allo Bank deal.


Turning tides: Bukalapak‚Äôs investment in Allo Bank challenges the argument that conglomerates like Allo Bank parent CT Corp are only interested in dominating industries, says Bukalapak president Teddy Oetomo. ‚ÄúThe attraction is that we have created such a broad, multi-ecosystem partnership, which has the potential to be big,‚Äù he tells Tech in Asia.


Wise heads: Since the purchase, the value of Bukalapak‚Äôs stake in Allo Bank has shot up, peaking at over US$1 billion last month, when the price of Allo Bank‚Äôs shares crossed 7,000 rupiah (48 US cents) apiece. ‚ÄúWe prefer to invest rather than develop our own because a digital bank is like a combination of a bank and a tech company ‚Äì it is not easy,‚Äù says Oetomo. ‚ÄúWe are not bankers.‚Äù


A treasure chest: Bukalapak has large enough cash reserves ‚Äì its IPO proceeds stood at US$1.4 billion as of December 2021. The ecommerce giant also holds a credit facility worth US$139 million through Singapore‚Äôs DBS Bank. ‚ÄúThe credit facility is for bridging purposes only,‚Äù Oetomo says. He mentions that the proceeds from Bukalapak‚Äôs IPO will not be used up even in the next three to five years.

The new round brings Best Beer Japan‚Äôs total funding to over US$1 million.

Founded in 2017 by former Tech in Asia Japan correspondent Peter Rothenberg, Best Beer Japan offers a management software platform for breweries. It has also created Japan‚Äôs first keg sharing service, which the company says reduces carbon emissions and cuts the logistics costs of beer transportation by half.
The company says that as breweries in the country sell to restaurants directly, they lack a consolidated distribution system. This creates an inefficient process for both breweries and restaurants. Best Beer Japan has started pre-registration for its B2B craft beer platform to make it easier for restaurants to find and pay for beer.
‚ÄúThis is a legacy industry. Until now breweries did not have any real IT tools to help with operations. But with the pandemic, adoption of new technologies has been rapid,‚Äù explains Rothenberg, who also serves as the company‚Äôs CEO.
According to him, breweries manage their back office mainly with paper and Microsoft Excel, which takes up to 14 minutes to process one order. There are also strict hygiene and alcohol tax laws that require a large amount of forms to be filled out.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think anyone became a brewer to do alcohol tax. Our mission is to help breweries focus on making beer, not pushing papers,‚Äù the CEO adds.
Best Beer Japan will use the fresh funds to hire engineers, sales, and customer success members. ‚ÄúWe are still a young company. If you join now you can get paid in cash, stock, and beer,‚Äù quips Rothenberg.
The startup also plans to invest in creating a B2B beer marketplace, bringing breweries to a single portal that restaurants can order from.

The company is looking to tap into the craft beer market, which is growing over 10% per year in Japan. The market is set to reach over US$1 billion in 2026 with alcohol tax law changes on the horizon.
While the number of breweries in the country has doubled from 250 in 2015 to 500 last year, craft beer accounts for only 1% to 2% of Japan‚Äôs beer market.

Hello there,
When one door closes, another door opens.
In a tight job market, fresh graduates adopt a spray-and-pray approach to job applications, going through multiple rejections before receiving an offer. While a lucky few will get their dream jobs, most will settle for another position, as they don‚Äôt have the luxury of time and unlimited finances.
But the truly determined will find ways to get the job of their dreams ‚Äì even if that means taking a detour.
Crypto providers hoping to obtain a license in Singapore will have to continue waiting it out as the country‚Äôs central bank offers the coveted digital payments services license to a select few. After all, the Monetary Authority of Singapore is one of the toughest regulators in the world.
Since it opened license applications in early 2020, the city-state has attracted notable names such as Binance, the world‚Äôs largest crypto exchange by trading volume.
Many who have been rejected or asked to withdraw their applications are now seeking new homes. Binance had seemingly led the charge when it opted for Dubai: With its free zones and generous tax incentives, the Emirati city is fast becoming an alternative destination for crypto firms.
In this week‚Äôs Big Story, we spoke to crypto players in Singapore and Dubai about what drew them to their home markets. Conversations with both successful and unsuccessful permit applicants in Singapore also shed light on a process that many have called opaque.
As one crypto observer put it, it‚Äôs premature to assume that Singapore has seen the last of Binance. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm 100% sure they‚Äôll come back when it‚Äôs the right time.‚Äù

THE BIG STORYIs Dubai stealing Singapore‚Äôs thunder in crypto?

Binance led the charge when it withdrew its application in the city-state in favor of Dubai. It appears that many are following suit.

THE HOT TAKEIndia warms up to crypto
Here‚Äôs what happened:

India will launch its own digital rupee, a sovereign-backed facility that is likely to debut by early 2023.
Unlike private digital tokens, the digital rupee blockchain gives the government the ability to track transactions.
The country also plans to impose a 30% tax on ‚Äåincome from the transfer of virtual assets.

Here‚Äôs our take:
After swinging back and forth on its crypto stance, which has ranged from promoting crypto to banning them, India moved a step closer toward adopting and legitimizing digital assets last week.
Citizens can potentially use the digital rupee in their e-wallets to pay for goods and services. A key difference is that the funds would be ‚Äúfrom the central bank‚Äù and ‚Äúfully backed by the sovereign,‚Äù a top government source told The Economic Times.
The digital rupee will build upon existing consumer habits around e-wallets and digital payments. In India, 3 billion transactions already take place over United Payments Interface ‚Äì the digital payment system developed by India‚Äôs largest banks ‚Äì each month.
The move comes as crypto trading and ownership soared in India in the past year. Estimates put the number of crypto investors in the country at 15 million to 20 million, who roughly hold US$6 billion in crypto assets.
According to blockchain data platform Chainalysis, India ranks second among countries with the highest crypto adoption in the world, trailing only Vietnam. We explored Vietnam‚Äôs crypto boom in this earlier story.
Several reasons have fueled the rise of crypto trading in India. Investing in equities can take up to three to four days due to documentation, but investing in crypto takes less than an hour, a Chainalysis report noted.
Many freelancers and those doing tech-related work for employers abroad are also asking to be paid in cryptocurrency out of convenience and interest in owning digital tokens.
While retail demand in the country is strong, a large proportion of crypto activity (42%) are being driven by institutional-sized transfers of above US$10 million.
What is India hoping to achieve with the digital rupee?
The new Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is expected to give a big boost to India‚Äôs digital economy, spurring higher levels of digital transactions since all citizens ‚Äì even those without bank accounts ‚Äì can access retail CBDCs in theory.
Also, CBDCs could lead to efficiency gains and a ‚Äúcheaper currency management system,‚Äù India‚Äôs Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in a recent budget speech.

Nirmala Sitharaman, India‚Äôs Minister of Finance and Corporate Affairs

If the government can successfully design a CBDC that becomes the de facto currency, it could reduce illicit transactions and money laundering that occur on private digital assets ‚Äì which it lacks oversight of ‚Äì and on fiat currency transactions that take place on privately run e-wallets.
But while a CBDC gives the central bank the ability to track transactions, some argue that the fintech firms operating e-wallets may lose visibility on customers and their transacting behavior. This might impact their ability to evaluate their clients and extend them loans.
India is also hoping to deter speculative trading by introducing a 30% tax rate on incomes from the transfer of digital assets. However, the high tax rates might simply push investors to migrate to service providers in other countries offering more competitive rates instead.
The UK‚Äôs tax regulator has similarly said that staked digital tokens that are used as collateral or lent out will be subject to a capital gains tax. However, some industry watchers have pointed out that these new rules could result in investors tracking and reporting ‚Äúhundreds to thousands‚Äù of transactions to stay compliant, which could be unfeasible in practice.

731363,2022-02-09T01:55:31,Is Dubai stealing Singapore‚Äôs thunder in crypto?,"There‚Äôs a saying that when your taxi driver starts telling you about Bitcoin, that‚Äôs when it‚Äôs time to sell.
That‚Äôs because when an asset sees a flood of retail investors, it could be a sign that it has reached speculative territory. And when the man on the street takes notice, so will the regulators.

While 2021 may go down as the year that crypto adoption took off and became mainstream, it was also a trying year for crypto companies in Singapore looking to gain legitimacy from one of the world‚Äôs toughest regulators.
In January, Singapore‚Äôs central bank warned crypto providers against marketing their services in public areas. These include using online or print advertisements, as well as hiring social media influencers to promote their services.
Amid that backdrop, financial hubs in the Middle East are gaining popularity as alternative crypto-friendly jurisdictions for firms seeking homes. Binance, the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, led the charge when it withdrew its application for a license in Singapore in favor of Dubai.
It appears that many are following suit, or considering a similar move. ‚ÄúThe trend is obvious. Businesses are moving away,‚Äù Anndy Lian, chairman of Netherlands-headquartered BigOne Exchange, tells Tech in Asia. With the exchange‚Äôs core market in Latin America, Lian says his company has no plans to apply for a license in Singapore. He adds that most crypto firms moving out of the city-state are eyeing markets like Dubai and Europe for their new homes.
Singapore is openly welcoming everybody, then openly rejecting almost everybody. 
Binance itself has run afoul of regulators in several markets, including the UK and Japan. But Lian says that the firm had served as a litmus test for crypto firms looking to set up a base in Singapore. And as far as many were concerned, that test had gone south.
Binance declined to comment on this story.
A long queue
At the time of writing, just three out of around 170 firms who applied for a digital payment token (DPT) service license in Singapore have obtained one.
Over a hundred have withdrawn their applications or been rejected, while at least one has received a license in-principle. According to the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), applicants who receive ‚Äúin-principle approvals‚Äù are still required to ‚Äúput in place necessary measures and fulfill certain administrative matters‚Äù before a license is officially granted.
The astonishing odds stacked against crypto hopefuls have led some to voice their frustrations that the city-state isn‚Äôt as welcoming as it seems.
‚ÄúSingapore is openly welcoming everybody, then openly rejecting almost everybody,‚Äù Lian observes. ‚ÄúIt makes people think, ‚Äòis Singapore not a place that I can set up? Is Singapore not a place for me to house myself?‚Äô‚Äù
While smaller crypto projects and decentralized autonomous organizations from Vietnam and Thailand still find Singapore an attractive location, more than half of the ‚Äúlarge exchanges‚Äù operating in Singapore no longer think that the city-state is a viable location for their Asia headquarters, Lian estimates. He didn‚Äôt name specific firms.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a bit seasonal,‚Äù remarks a source whose firm was asked by the MAS to withdraw its application, referring to Singapore‚Äôs increasingly tough stance on the crypto sector. The source requested anonymity for fear of retribution.

The source tells Tech in Asia that the firm wasn‚Äôt told specifically in which areas it fell short. When asked, case officers said it had ‚Äúconsidered all parts of the application‚Äù and that it considered the ‚Äútotal readiness‚Äù of the company in its review.
However, he admitted that the firm ‚Äúdid not do well‚Äù on demonstrating its understanding of a travel rule, which requires crypto service providers to be able to identify the sources and destinations of their funds.
A waiting game
In a parliamentary sitting held in July 2021, Senior Minister and Minister in charge of MAS Tharman Shanmugaratnam said that the regulator would reject applicants that ‚Äúfail to meet the required standards for money laundering and financing of terrorism and technology risks set out in MAS‚Äô regulations and notices.‚Äù
When the city-state opened the floodgates in 2020, it was met with an overwhelming response from applicants. This led to a lengthy application process, which came at a cost for some crypto license-hopefuls.
‚ÄúFor one year, we didn‚Äôt dare to do any major promotions about our business or scale up the business,‚Äù the source says, as their firm waited to be contacted by a case officer. That‚Äôs despite having spent ‚Äúat least US$500,000‚Äù into building its product, as well as for paying the operational costs that the firm continued to incur during that time.
But Independent Reserve ‚Äì one of the three DPT license holders in Singapore ‚Äì tells Tech in Asia that it found the entire application process to be ‚Äúpleasant‚Äù and ‚Äúnot opaque at all.‚Äù The Bitcoin and crypto exchange is the Singapore entity of Australia-headquartered Independent Reserve.
Drawn to the city-state‚Äôs reputation as a ‚Äúworld-renowned regulator,‚Äù Independent Reserve applied for a license in early 2020 and was granted one after an 18-month process, says Raks Sondhi, the firm‚Äôs managing director in Singapore.
‚ÄúIt was very much a dialogue between two organizations. When we got questions which we could answer with a ‚Äòyes‚Äô or a ‚Äòno,‚Äô we did not do that. We provided a lot more information that was not always requested of us to make sure that [the regulator] understood where we were coming from,‚Äù he explains.
In email responses to Tech in Asia, a spokesperson for the MAS says that the agency engages applicants extensively to understand the risks of each applicant‚Äôs business. ‚ÄúApplicants are informed of their application review outcomes, including MAS‚Äô considerations in the event of an unsuccessful license application,‚Äù the spokesperson adds.
The allure of Dubai
For BigOne Exchange‚Äôs Lian, Binance‚Äôs departure simply hastened the exits of other crypto companies out of the city-state, which began six months ago.
As Singapore turned inward during the pandemic, introducing more stringent requirements for foreign work passes and prioritizing local hires, Dubai welcomed digital nomads with open arms with a one-year virtual working program.
Crypto firms incorporating in Dubai have ‚Äúmushroomed‚Äù in the past year, observes Meng Chan Shu, co-founder and CEO of Dubai-based Connect Blockchain, who has lived in the city for over a decade.

A combination of the city‚Äôs attractive tax rates, pro-business policies, and crypto-friendly stance have attracted an inflow of crypto firms in recent years.
Shu, whose firm offers a crypto-to-crypto exchange as well as proprietary trading services, estimates that ‚Äúeasily more than 100‚Äù firms have set up shop in the past couple of months within the Dubai Multi Commodities Center (DMCC) free zone, where Connect Blockchain operates.
In a dedicated crypto center within the DMCC, a 0% personal and corporate tax rate, 100% business ownership, and no capital repatriation limits are just a few of the perks offered. This means that expats can fully own their companies and remit all profits back to their home countries. In contrast, it‚Äôs common for many countries to impose ownership rules that mandate foreign firms to acquiesce the majority stakes to a local firm.
Singapore, too, does not impose foreign ownership requirements on businesses. While the country‚Äôs corporate income tax rate is a flat 17%, various incentives and rebates can lower the effective interest rate.
The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has roughly 30 free trade zones that offer a wealth of benefits to foreign investors. A majority of these are located in Dubai.
The city started welcoming crypto firms and talent from as early as 2016. Two years later, the UAE followed with a blockchain strategy that aimed to bring 50% of government transactions onto a blockchain platform by 2021.
Crypto companies and projects always look for alpha and adoption. That‚Äôs more important.
Like many, Shu was part of a rush of firms in Dubai looking to cash in on the Middle East‚Äôs booming crypto sector.
Dubai‚Äôs strategic location and a time zone that straddles Asian, European, and US business and trading hours makes it highly connected and attractive to firms targeting a global audience. ‚ÄúIf I want to go anywhere in Europe or in Asia, it‚Äôs seven hours away,‚Äù Shu adds.
In contrast, Singapore‚Äôs proximity to Asia isn‚Äôt as attractive to some crypto firms given the 24/7 and borderless nature of the industry.
That said, Singapore boasts a relatively high level of awareness around crypto. Its proximity to the large unbanked and underbanked markets of Southeast Asia also matters.
Vietnam, a largely cash-based society, is ranked the world‚Äôs highest in crypto adoption according to Chainalysis. Nearly 6 million people ‚Äì or 6% of the population ‚Äì own the digital asset, which play-to-earn games have widely popularized in the past year.

‚ÄúIn jurisdictions where a large majority of the population are unbanked or underbanked, the demand for crypto, more specifically decentralized finance, can come in to bring about greater financial inclusion,‚Äù says Edward Chen, CEO of crypto exchange Huobi Singapore.
No mass exodus
Crypto executives based in both financial centers, however, don‚Äôt think the industry‚Äôs firms are leaving Singapore in droves.
‚ÄúA lot of firms are still migrating toward Singapore and basing themselves in Singapore. Firms will expand to jurisdictions that allow crypto businesses to operate,‚Äù Independent Reserve‚Äôs Sondhi says.


He adds that organizations tend to ‚Äústay where they can stay until the legislation or regulatory framework changes or evolves, and they make a decision whether to remain there or to move elsewhere.‚Äù
The firm sees Singapore‚Äôs strict approach as being ‚Äúappropriate to filter the serious players in the market,‚Äù despite being impacted by the MAS‚Äô most recent guidelines.
‚ÄúWe understand and appreciate that the emphasis has always been on protecting consumers and ensuring the safety of their assets and data,‚Äù Sondhi adds. ‚ÄúWith consultations and working with the companies in Singapore who are applying for licenses and who have received these licenses, I think we‚Äôll be able to work through this.‚Äù
Still, there should be some caution when pitting Singapore against Dubai.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not an apple-to-apple comparison. Crypto companies and projects always look for alpha and adoption. That‚Äôs more important,‚Äù Shu of Connect Blockchain says.
It‚Äôs likely that Singapore‚Äôs reputation as a digital financial hub will see it continually draw in crypto firms, as many seek to gain credibility and legitimacy in the public sphere.
We don‚Äôt need 160 of them to set up shop here. Half of them can do so, but with very high standards, that I think is a better outcome.
‚Äú‚Äã‚ÄãBoth Singapore and Dubai are known for their open economy, trade openness, and stable environments. Both countries are also well-established financial hubs with a track record for progressive policies and innovation in Asia Pacific and the Middle East, respectively, making them well-placed to be the crypto hubs in the region,‚Äù Huobi‚Äôs Chen says.
The firm is currently operating with an exemption from holding a license in Singapore, while it awaits the results of its application.
‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt need 160 of them to set up shop here. Half of them can do so, but with very high standards, that I think is a better outcome,‚Äù Ravi Menon, managing director of the MAS, said in a Bloomberg interview last November.
Despite its unsuccessful attempt, the anonymous source says that their firm plans to re-apply for a permit in Singapore in the future, when sentiments around crypto are more positive and when there‚Äôs greater regulatory clarity.
The firm is open to applying in other Southeast Asian markets where there‚Äôs a successful rollout of a license regime, though it‚Äôs ruling out markets like Dubai, which it deems ‚Äúunfamiliar.‚Äù

Carousell co-founders Marcus Tan (M), Lucas Ngoo (R), and Quek Siu Rui (L) / Photo credit: Carousell

The acquisition comes amid Carousell‚Äôs plans to merge with blank-check firm L Catterton Asia Acquisition Corp and list in the US. The merged entity could reportedly be valued at US$1.5 billion.
The Business Times first reported that Carousell is in talks to acquire 99 Group.
Carousell could go public through the merger with the SPAC¬†as early as this quarter. Meanwhile, the blank-check firm will carry out its due diligence on the classifieds company over the coming weeks.
99 Group declined to comment on the matter. Meanwhile, Carousell told Tech in Asia that it is constantly considering all options and opportunities to build an enduring marketplace.
Carousell and 99 Group have a slew of common investors, including Sequoia Capital India, 500 Durians, Golden Gate Ventures, and 500 Global. 99 Group CEO Darius Cheung has also backed Carousell, along with other big-ticket investors such as Rakuten Ventures and Naver Corp, which owns mobile messenger service Line.
The Carousell-99 fit
The deal will help Carousell access 99.co‚Äôs property search platform, which operates in Singapore and Indonesia. 99.co has also acquired data service provider Singapore Real Estate Exchange and Rumah123.
Notably, Carousell also has it own property listings unit in Singapore.
Carousell was last valued at US$1.06 billion, while 99 Group was valued at US$83.6 million in early 2020, according to data from VentureCap Insights.
If the deal goes through, 99 Group‚Äôs valuation will be well above that figure.

The move is likely a part of Carousell‚Äôs recent efforts to tap into high-ticket categories such as auto and luxury goods through a series of acquisitions. Carousell has bought firms like Ox Street, Caarly, OneShift, OLX Philippines, and 701Search.

Carousell Group‚Äôs advertising arm, Carousell Media Group, has also launched its own advertising servicing platform to take on Google and Facebook‚Äôs dominance in the space.
While 99 Group has seen significant growth in Singapore, it has been looking to expand across Southeast Asia. In 2020, 99 Group also doubled its monthly user base in Singapore to 19.8 million and posted a 62% surge in its revenue despite setbacks due to Covid-19.
The potential sale will help the proptech firm fuel its expansion plans in markets such as Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam, which it entered last year.

99 Group could also be a good bet for Carousell as the former is poised to transition from a classifieds model to more of a transaction platform, allowing it to take a more active role in buying and selling properties rather than simply matching property agents with homeowners.
The company had earlier told Tech in Asia that it was chasing growth that would require venture capital or private equity funding. The money from the Carousell deal could help it take those plans forward.
The deal could also help 99 Group better compete with rival PropertyGuru, which operates in the same five markets and plans to go public in June via a SPAC merger with Bridgetown 2 Holdings.

According to SoftBank, it would recognize a breakup fee of roughly US$1.2 billion, which Nvidia had deposited as part of the deal, as profit in the fourth quarter.

Hello reader,
Becoming a unicorn startup isn‚Äôt as rare an occurrence as it used to be. According to Wikipedia, when the term was first coined in 2013, there were only 39 companies that could claim the title. Now, it seems like a new unicorn pops up everywhere I turn. Building a billion-dollar company is an awesome achievement and a testament to how the tech and startup scene has grown globally.
As such, every startup ecosystem wants a few of these startups to call their own ‚Äì and Malaysia is no exception. The country is looking to have five unicorns in its stables come 2025, and one of the likely candidates is drone tech startup Aerodyne. It‚Äôs certainly a prized jewel in Malaysia‚Äôs startup crown, but it‚Äôs also operating in an exciting space that‚Äôs starting to heat up.
Today we look at:

Malaysia has been looking for its next unicorn, and at the top of the list of potentials sits drone tech startup Aerodyne. According to market research firm Drone Industry Insights, Aerodyne is the no. 1 drone service provider in the world and has closed several funding rounds, drawing in a roster of multinational institutional investors.


Meeting a need: Founded in 2016, Aerodyne started as a business unit of a company that founder Kamarul A. Muhamed previously launched. While the unit was focused on capturing visuals using drones, Kamarul saw a bigger opportunity: offering drone services to take on high-risk jobs. The firm soon added data analytics to its services and now bills itself as a DT3 company, offering drone tech, data tech, and digital transformation services across different industries such as agriculture and security.


Right time, right place: According to a Kuala Lumpur-based investment banker, Aerodyne had a recipe for success: It entered the market at the right time, made money as its initial business verticals were profitable, and has maintained that growth thanks to an ecosystem that has supported it.


It‚Äôs getting hot in here: But competition is heating up in Malaysia‚Äôs drone tech space, with several other firms grappling for a slice of the pie. Still, Aerodyne is on the up and has plans to list on the public markets in the next few years.

731634,2022-02-08T09:25:23,This fintech firm‚Äôs fight with its founder may end in a courtroom,"BharatPe, a fintech unicorn backed by Tiger Global and Sequoia India, has been in the news lately for all the wrong reasons.
After a string of alleged boardroom tussles, claims of fraud, and badmouthing, it would be no surprise if the company‚Äôs board is headed towards a legal battle with one of its founders, Ashneer Grover.

Grover, who is on leave for two months, last week sent a letter to the board that sought the removal of the company‚Äôs CEO, Suhail Sameer, calling him an ‚Äúinvestors‚Äô puppet‚Äù. However, Shashvat Nakrani, BharatPe‚Äôs other founder, has backed Sameer.
This has created a deadlock between Grover and Nakrani. According to legal experts, company founders jointly have the right to appoint a CEO, and the CEO can be removed if all the founders decide to withdraw the person‚Äôs nomination from the board.
Grover is also seeking a whopping US$535 million payout to quit the company. According to an Economic Times report, the board is unlikely to accept Grover‚Äôs demand.
‚ÄúIn light of these situations, there is a high likelihood that this may lead to court litigation if the deadlock is not resolved,‚Äù Salman Waris, managing partner at TechLegis Advocates &amp; Solicitors, an India-based law firm, told Tech in Asia.
Grover has already assembled a legal team¬†to protect himself against a possible ouster from BharatPe. He has also begun talks to sell nearly 10% stake in the company.
‚ÄúThis is an indication of a cultural difference between how investors want things done and how the founder thought he could run the show,‚Äù notes a legal expert who did not want to be named.
An email that Tech in Asia sent to BharatPe did not elicit a response while calls made to Grover went unanswered.
Grover‚Äôs tumble from the top
Amid these controversies and questions about its corporate governance, BharatPe underwent an independent audit of its internal processes and systems.
The audit‚Äôs findings, which were leaked on Twitter, cast a shadow over Grover and his wife Madhuri Grover as they were linked to ‚Äúfraudulent schemes,‚Äù according to a Livemint report.
The preliminary probe by auditing firm Alvarez and Marsal pointed to recruitment fraud and payment to non-existent members. But BharatPe stated that its board has yet to receive an interim or final report of the review.

Grover responded by calling the audio clip a fake on Twitter, but he later deleted the tweet. Meanwhile, Kotak Mahindra Bank said that it was planning to take legal action against Grover and his wife, who is also BharatPe‚Äôs head of controls.

The city-state saw its total transaction value for fintech deals surge by 59% year-on-year, amounting to US$3.9 billion in 2021, noted the KPMG Pulse of FinTech H2‚Äô21.
The report attributed this growth to Singapore‚Äôs crypto and blockchain space continuing to see rising interest. For the past two years, investments in crypto and blockchain companies have outpaced the funding received by payments firms.


Singapore saw record levels of investment in crypto and blockchain, with nearly US$1.5 billion transacted across 82 deals in 2021 as compared to US$109.7 million over 26 deals in the previous year. The report noted that majority of the crypto and blockchain deals in the city-state last year went toward software and underlying infrastructure rather than services.
‚ÄúCryptocurrencies and blockchain are expected to remain very hot areas of investment in 2022, with more crypto firms looking to regulators to provide clear guidance on activities in order to help foster and develop the space,‚Äù said Anton Ruddenklau, global fintech leader at KPMG International.
While funding in the payments space fell behind crypto and blockchain investments, there was a 10x increase in the value of payments-related deals locally. Total funding in the space grew from US$60 million in 2020 to US$628.4 million in 2021.
A continued interest in areas like buy now, pay later, embedded banking, and open banking-aligned solutions have helped keep the payments space robust, noted the report.

731564,2022-02-08T05:00:34,Behind Bukalapak‚Äôs entry into Indonesia‚Äôs digital banking race,"Bukalapak, an Indonesian ecommerce giant, kicked off 2022 by spending US$83 million to acquire 12.05% of Allo Bank, a Jakarta-based digital bank owned by Chairul Tanjung, an entrepreneur and former politician.
This was not Bukalapak‚Äôs first venture into the banking industry ‚Äì in mid-2021, the online marketplace made a deal to integrate Standard Chartered‚Äôs banking-as-a-service solution into its platform.
However, for the recently listed firm, buying a stake in Allo Bank is a significant move within Indonesia‚Äôs fast-growing digital banking space. Notably, Bukalapak‚Äôs co-investors in the digital bank include conglomerate Salim Group, super app Grab, and automotive marketplace Carro.

Bukalapak‚Äôs office / Photo credit: Bukalapak

Indeed, Emtek ‚Äì one of Bukalapak‚Äôs major shareholders ‚Äì already has plans to turn the Bandung-based Bank Fama into a digital bank, with help from Grab and Singaporean telco Singtel. The media conglomerate holds a majority stake in Bank Fama.
Bukalapak‚Äôs investment in Allo Bank goes against the argument that conglomerates like Allo Bank parent CT Corp are only interested in dominating industries, says Bukalapak president Teddy Oetomo. In fact, such companies are now used to collaborations with multiple parties, including tech players like Bukalapak, he adds.
‚ÄúThe attraction is that we have created such a broad, multi-ecosystem partnership, which has the potential to be big,‚Äù Oetomo tells Tech in Asia.
Allo Bank‚Äôs appeal
The acquisition of Allo Bank allows Bukalapak to dive into retail ‚Äì a growing trend among ecommerce companies. Not long after the deal, Bukalapak announced an e-grocery joint venture with Trans Retail, another unit of Tanjung‚Äôs CT Corp. Trans Retail operates the Transmart supermarket chain and previously managed the Indonesian outlets of France‚Äôs Carrefour.

Bukalapak‚Äôs move followed those of a few other internet firms: GoTo snapped up over 6.74% of Matahari Putra Prima, while Blibli planned to acquire a majority stake in Ranch Market operator Boga Supra Lestari.
Bukalapak was also drawn to Allo Bank because of the latter‚Äôs valuation prospects. According to Oetomo, the bank‚Äôs price-to-book ratio was 1.7 when the acquisition took place, which was more attractive than that of other licensed digital banks.
Since the purchase, the value of Bukalapak‚Äôs shares in Allo Bank has also shot up. Bukalapak had bought the shares at an exercise price of 478 rupiah (3.3 US cents) per share. That number peaked at over 7,000 rupiah (48 US cents) in January 2022, boosting the value of Bukalapak‚Äôs assets in Allo Bank to over US$1 billion ‚Äì a growth of more than 12x from its initial US$83 million investment.
‚ÄúWe prefer to invest rather than develop our own because a digital bank is like a combination of a bank and a tech company ‚Äì it is not easy,‚Äù says Oetomo. ‚ÄúWe are not bankers.‚Äù
Of course, one obvious question is how a digital bank will affect Bukalapak‚Äôs bottom line.

In the first three quarters of 2021, the company clocked net revenue of US$94 million, of which US$54 million was marketplace revenue, US$35 million came from Mitra Bukalapak, and US$5 million from its B2B arm, BukaPengadaan.
Investing in Allo Bank ties in well with the tech firm‚Äôs larger strategy for Mitra Bukalapak. It could allow warungs or roadside stalls served by the company‚Äôs online-to-offline offering to improve their trading capacity, Oetomo adds. The bank will also offer various financial services to Bukalapak‚Äôs consumers and help achieve more sustainable business growth.
The deal opens the door for various commercial agreements, ranging from revenue sharing to capital appreciation, Oetomo says, adding that such deals will boost Bukalapak‚Äôs bottom line. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre confident that it will positively contribute to our paid gross transaction values.‚Äù
Ultimately, these banking services could benefit all of Bukalapak‚Äôs stakeholders, which include its 6.7 million merchant partners on its marketplace, 10.4 million Mitra Bukalapak partners, and 100 million end consumers.
Aldi Adrian Hartanto, vice president of investments at MDI Ventures, agrees that Bukalapak will benefit greatly from its tie-up with Allo Bank because the ecommerce firm can create synergies with both CT Corp and the Salim Group amid its efforts to expand in retail.
‚ÄúThe impact on Bukalapak doesn‚Äôt seem to be direct. It‚Äôs more about synergies to leverage multiple other relationships, especially for the sake of Mitra Bukalapak transactions,‚Äù he says.
Mitra Bukalapak partners, for instance, can process all their transactions for fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), non-FMCG, and virtual products through the Allo Bank connected to the Mitra Bukalapak app. End consumers can also pay their bills via the Bukalapak marketplace.

Hartanto adds that integrating these apps can in turn provide convenience for Bukalapak users. It would increase user stickiness and contribute to Bukalapak‚Äôs revenue through transaction fees.
At the same time, digital banks also need a broad ecosystem to acquire users. The size of the ecosystem determines the benefits to users, which is crucial to earning loyalty.
Playing the long game
Part of the reason digital banks are attractive is their potential for profits. For example, foreign players like KakaoBank or WeBank each reported over US$100 million in net profit by 2020, as did Gojek-backed Bank Jago.
At the same time, profitability can‚Äôt come instantly. KakaoBank, for instance, turned a profit in 2019 ‚Äì about two years after it began operations.
That said, the losses may not necessarily impact Bukalapak‚Äôs finances directly, according to Paulus Jimmy, an equity research analyst at Sucor Sekuritas. He says that when it comes to sentiment in the public market, Bukalapak has bigger fish to fry than its digital banking strategies.
Bukalapak‚Äôs shares did rise to 500 rupiah (3.4 US cents) per share on January 3, thanks to its investment in Allo Bank. However, they dropped to 338 rupiah (2.3 US cents) per share by January 25, far from the IPO price of 850 rupiah (5.9 US cents).


‚ÄúInvestors think that the overall perception of the tech sector is still poor. Many expect that with the recovery that will occur this year, the old economy will grow and become attractive again,‚Äù says Paulus.
Because Allo Bank‚Äôs business development strategy is still unclear, Bukalapak will not benefit in the short term, he adds. It‚Äôs a similar scenario for Bukalapak‚Äôs joint venture with CT Corp.
‚ÄúThe joint venture is in e-grocery, emerging industry with great potential, especially during a pandemic. But on the other hand, the challenges are also big, especially in terms of logistics and the waste generated,‚Äù he says.

Nevertheless, Bukalapak still has large enough cash reserves ‚Äì its IPO proceeds stood at US$1.4 billion as of December 2021. Also, the company holds a credit facility worth US$139 million through Singapore‚Äôs DBS Bank.
‚ÄúThe credit facility is for bridging purposes only,‚Äù Oetomo says. ‚ÄúWith the Allo Bank investment numbering below [US$83 million], there is still a buffer.‚Äù He mentions that the proceeds from Bukalapak‚Äôs IPO will not be used up even in the next three to five years.
Paulus adds that Bukalapak has received approval for the change in the use of its IPO funds: it is allocating 33% of proceeds for working capital ‚Äì half the initial amount ‚Äì in order to make room for corporate actions. For investors, this serves as a clear enough sign of the company‚Äôs growth strategies going forward.

Hello reader,
As one of the more mature markets in Southeast Asia, Singapore has cultivated a startup ecosystem worth US$22.5 billion and boasts tech behemoths such as Sea Group. But far from being done and dusted, the Lion City just keeps on producing promising fledgling businesses.
The city-state is now home to thousands of young tech companies, a growing population of venture capitalists, and several unicorns that were either founded locally or set up regional offices. Singapore has also become an international business hub that‚Äôs has drawn major multinational corporations and recognized for its workforce and efficient public sector.
In 2014, a VC told Grab co-founder Anthony Tan that his startup could one day surpass the market value of his father‚Äôs company: Tan Chong Motor, a household name in Malaysia. However, the VC said this was only possible if he moved Grab‚Äôs headquarters from Malaysia to Singapore. The shift was made and, well, the rest, as the idiom goes, is history.
The VC‚Äôs advice merely reflects Singapore‚Äôs accommodating mindset towards startups.

So which startups have recently reaped the benefits of being part of this thriving ecosystem? We listed them down for you ‚Äì read on to find out.

The sheer number of startups in Singapore that are cropping up and trying to disrupt various industries is staggering. A glance at our rising 50 list indicates that no single industry is taking center stage.
While fintech, crypto and edtech do get a lot of attention due to their relatively larger market size, Singapore‚Äôs ecosystem also provides funding opportunities for startups in less lucrative spaces such as professional networking, broadcasting, and digital media.


On to something special: Out of the 50 startups that got fresh funds, only four have raised over US$100 million: mixed martial arts platform One Championship, edtech company LingoAce, and fintech firms Tyme and Spenmo.


Standing out: Known as the ‚ÄúBloomberg for digital assets,‚Äù Nansen caters to the growing need for analysis and research into cryptocurrencies as investors look to secure their digital assets in a highly volatile market. The startup helps investors make informed decisions around project discovery, due diligence, and trading.


This one is for the foodies: Retail food startups looking to serve shifting consumer tastes are also getting their fair share of the VC spotlight. Abillionveg, a social platform for vegan food reviews, has raised US$13 million, while plant-based ice cream brand Kind Kones has secured US$1.9 million.

Going digital: The company also provides live tracking, insights, and analytics for shipping. ‚ÄúSmall and medium-sized enterprises are reliant on mental notes and telephone calls to run their businesses,‚Äù Truck It In said in a statement.

Founded in late 2021, Bananas helps customers shop for groceries within 10 minutes via its tech-enabled microhubs, also known as dark stores, which are located near high-density residential neighborhoods.
The company was founded by Mario Gaw, former chief product officer at Tiket.com, along with Kristian Sinaulan, who served as the interim chief technology officer of Cashbac.
‚ÄúWe believe our tech solution will provide ease and save the hassle of grocery shopping, leading to more time that can be spent with loved ones,‚Äù said Sinaulan.
Bananas will use the latest investment to ramp up hiring at the company, mainly to support its operations including product, dark stores, inventory, and customer services. The firm aims to launch at least 50 dark stores that are primarily located in Jakarta and other Tier 1 cities in Indonesia in the short term.

731409,2022-02-07T05:38:03,Aerodyne: Can it remain Malaysia‚Äôs drone jewel?,"Since Grab moved its headquarters to Singapore, Malaysia has been on a quest to churn out its next unicorn. The country has set a target to raise five companies with valuations north of US$1 billion by 2025.
One name that‚Äôs on the lips of ecosystem stakeholders ‚Äì including policymakers ‚Äì is Aerodyne.

Photo credit: Aerodyne

The drone specialist has made headlines for being a Malaysian champion that has a presence abroad, defying the ‚Äújaguh kampung‚Äù label, a jibe in the Malay language aimed at local firms that can‚Äôt compete overseas despite enjoying privileges at home.
Aerodyne is the no. 1 drone service provider in the world, according to market research firm Drone Industry Insights (DII).
Since it was launched, the firm has closed a few funding rounds, drawing in a multinational roster of institutional investors. Even VentureTech, a unit under the Malaysian Industry-Government Group for High Technology,¬†jumped on the bandwagon and provided a 20 million ringgit (US$4.8 million) investment for the company to expand its drone business.
More importantly, the firm‚Äôs meteoric rise has influenced policymakers to improve regulations, such as launching a sandbox program for drone tech hopefuls, which in turn has spurred the growth of the local drone industry.
DII estimates that by 2025, the drone tech sector will register US$127 billion worldwide and US$300 million in Malaysia specifically.
And it‚Äôs easy to understand this hype: Commercial drone services can be used in a wide range of areas ‚Äì from asset inspection, agriculture, logistics, to security and surveillance.
Besides having ample land, Malaysia is home to a few drone test sites, and many of its key sectors ‚Äì such as infrastructure and oil palm ‚Äì have begun to rely on drone technology, primarily due to Covid-19 restrictions that have caused an acute labor shortage.
But amid these tailwinds, can Aerodyne continue to be the darling of the drone tech scene?

Aerodyne group CEO Kamarul A. Muhamed / Photo credit: EY

Aerodyne group CEO Kamarul A. Muhamed tells Tech in Asia in an email interview that in the beginning, building the company with a ‚Äúlimited budget and local resources‚Äù was a major challenge.
But Aerodyne, he says, is an outlier because it‚Äôs constantly pivoting to ‚Äúsolve real-world challenges.‚Äù
Growth engines
Although it was founded in 2014, Aerodyne‚Äôs roots go back eight years before its inception, when it was a division in a media production company that Kamarul founded.
While the unit was intended to capture visuals using drones, Kamarul saw a bigger opportunity: offering drone services to take on high-risk jobs ‚Äì drones could carry out these tasks at about two-thirds the cost.
When Aerodyne was incorporated, it began working on solutions for asset inspection. Its first customer was national oil company Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas), who tasked the firm to monitor and track the progress of the US$27 billion Pengerang Integrated Complex in Johor.
Aerodyne then ventured into data analytics, allowing companies to apply their findings to manage assets better while also lowering maintenance costs.
The firm is now billing itself as a DT3 company, offering drone tech, data tech, and digital transformation.
But besides drone-based asset management, Kamarul says Aerodyne has four growth engines: Agrimor (precision agriculture), Fulcrum (surveillance and security), Dronos (data tech), and Argentavis (logistics).
This entire process was the right recipe for Aerodyne, says a Kuala Lumpur-based investment banker.
‚ÄúIt was lucky, it entered the market at the right time with its novel solutions, raked in money as its initial business verticals were profitable, and has maintained that growth thanks to a somewhat encouraging ecosystem,‚Äù he says.
But Aerodyne‚Äôs growth hasn‚Äôt been smooth. The company, Kamarul says, has gone through nine different crises that include Covid-19.
He says Agrimor and Fulcrum are two examples of how the company devised solutions amid pandemic-induced restrictions to turn its fortunes around.
For instance, Agrimor was introduced when many foreign workers were sent back to their home countries when Malaysia was in lockdown.
Agrimor helps farmers increase crop yield while lowering operating costs by precisely seeding, fertilizing, watering, and even spraying crops.
Meanwhile, Fulcrum, the company‚Äôs AI-driven surveillance and security drone solutions, came about following the Malaysian police force‚Äôs request for assistance in ensuring compliance during lockdown.
‚ÄúSince our work was also impacted due to the lockdown, we had to rethink how to purpose our 50 pilots,‚Äù Kamarul said. Fulcrum‚Äôs swarm drones were deployed to make ‚Äúcompliance monitoring safer, faster, as well as more efficient,‚Äù says the CEO.
Despite these advances, Aerodyne is setting its sights further.
‚ÄúWe are developing a super app for agriculture that we can deploy globally, and the solution will be ready for export by this year,‚Äù Kamarul shares.
Competition heats up
Aerodyne isn‚Äôt the only one in the drone industry who‚Äôs capitalizing on a crisis. Malaysia-based Poladrone drew in about US$4.3 million in a seed round led by Wavemaker Partners, according to an October 26 TechCrunch report.
Poladrone‚Äôs niche is in agriculture, and its flagship program, Oracytes, is also a precision agriculture solution targeted at oil palm plantations.
But the company is moving further into Aerodyne territory with its plans to tackle jobs in high-risk industries. Poladrone also ventured abroad to Thailand in early 2020.
Another Malaysian drone player, Meraque Services, teamed up with pharmaceutical giant Pharmaniaga to launch an initiative that would deliver critical medicine to flood victims.
Dubbed Project Eagle, the program deployed four drones over three days to deliver supplies to 30 homes in the Kuala Langat neighborhood in Selangor.
More established logistics companies such as Capital A (formerly AirAsia) and DHL Express have also either launched or are testing their own drone solutions in the country.
Capital A has launched an academy to train drone pilots, while DHL has worked with local drone tech provider Pen Aviation to test last-mile cargo deliveries.
A DHL spokesperson tells Tech in Asia that its proof-of-concept (POC) with Pen Aviation came on the heels of the recent 12th Malaysian Plan, a five-year development program announced by the government last year that highlights the importance of seamless connectivity and reliability in transport and logistics and other focus areas.
‚ÄúThe use of drone technology will enable us to reach rural communities especially in East Malaysia, where critical items such as vaccines, medicines, and medical devices are needed,‚Äù says the spokesperson.
Work on the DHL-Pen Aviation POC is ongoing, with the logistics giant aiming to deploy drones to transfer packages of up to 12 kilograms from cargo ship decks to the ports and vice versa.
Navigating regulatory hurdles
Regulations are the bane of drone tech players in Malaysia, as these firms often have to seek approvals from a lot of different agencies.

But policymakers have been working to ease red tape over the last three years, Wan Mohd Farhan Wan Mohd Fuaad, a drone industry advocate, tells Tech in Asia.
As a result, Malaysian firms have seen tremendous growth, Wan Mohd Farhan argues, citing the likes of Aerodyne, Meraque, Poladrone,¬†and Ofo Tech who have ‚Äúdefinitely benefited from market readiness, awareness, and the relatively affordable acquisition cost of technology.‚Äù
Among the much-talked-about policies that are in place include the National Technology &amp; Innovation Sandbox, which acts as a bridge between regulators and drone tech companies.
Wan Mohd Farhan says that regulations are hard to avoid and even necessary.
The rise of drone applications in agriculture as well as among hobbyists does pose a national and public security risk since drones can capture and process images.
But the numbers in the industry have been encouraging, Wan Mohd Farhan adds. Malaysia‚Äôs standards and quality agency, SIRIM, estimates that more than 66,000 registered drones have been imported as of 2021, while drone maker DJI mentioned in a 2020 webinar interview that Malaysia is its biggest market in Southeast Asia.
Wan Mohd Farhan also points out that local regulators in the country, led by the Civil Aviation Authority of Malaysia‚Äôs (CAAM) drone taskforce, which was set up in early 2020, have made strides in understanding the industry.
The Civil Aviation Directive 6011, which spells out the requirements for unmanned aircraft systems in areas such as agriculture, is one example of how government agencies are making clearer regulations. There‚Äôs also the remote pilot training organizations program, which local drone training firm Drone Academy and Capital A were recent beneficiaries of.

Coupled with the availability of land, which means larger test sites for drone companies, these moves have encouraged overseas firms, such as Singapore-based Garuda Robotics, to test their solutions in Malaysia.
‚ÄúThe larger the area, the more realistic the environment for companies who are testing new drone technologies and developing drone solutions involving beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) flights,‚Äù Garuda managing director Frederick Ooi tells Tech in Asia.
Garuda is running trials, as well as providing supporting and consulting services, at the Medini drone test site (DTS) in Johor, Malaysia‚Äôs southernmost state.
The Medini DTS is said to be the largest test site in Southeast Asia.
Still tricky to navigate
Challenges still abound for those wanting to make inroads in the drone space. Singapore-based logistics firm Ninja Van put its drone delivery ambitions in Malaysia on the back burner.
Meraque CEO Md Razalee Ismail tells Tech in Asia that last-mile drone deliveries for medicine are viable, but scaling it won‚Äôt be easy for many reasons.
First, demand is an issue. Unless the market for last-mile medicine delivery is primed, it‚Äôs going to be hard for industry players to invest in providing these solutions.
Second, the government needs to make sure that the ecosystem is ready to support the mass production of drones to be used in last-mile delivery, as ‚Äúit is very costly just to import a drone, let alone to provide a purpose-built drone for last-mile medicine delivery,‚Äù says Razalee. ‚ÄúIn this light, there has to be both policies to spur growth of a drone-tech-related supply chain and economic incentives for relevant industry players.‚Äù
Third, regulations are still not up to snuff. ‚ÄúThere has been great support from regulators like CAAM, but there is still infrastructure that needs to be made ready, such as the unmanned traffic management system and a more integrated and streamlined approval process for drone flight operations,‚Äù he notes.
Currently, it takes time for each flight to be approved due to flight safety operations, ‚Äúwhich we fully understand, as drones share the same airspace as civilian and military aircraft,‚Äù shares Razalee.
Larger corporations, too, face systemic problems when deploying drones to audit and maintain assets.
Kuala Lumpur-based telco tower giant Edotco tells Tech in Asia that its ‚Äúcurrent challenge and limitation‚Äù is identifying the assets of operators or tenants on older towers it acquired.
IPO on track
Aerodyne seems to be unfazed by some of the restrictions that newer entrants are facing.
The company‚Äôs plan to list in the ‚Äúnext few years‚Äù is on track, Kamarul says. ‚ÄúOur potential options right now include the Nasdaq, Tokyo Stock Exchange, and we are also exploring dual-listing on Bursa Malaysia.‚Äù
DealStreetAsia reported that the drone company has been in the market to raise US$100 million since June last year.
Investor heavyweights such as Japan‚Äôs Drone Fund, China‚Äôs North Summit Capital, and Malaysia‚Äôs Axiata Digital Innovation Fund participated in Aerodyne‚Äôs previous funding rounds.
The drone specialist is also on the hunt for mergers and acquisitions. It recently purchased Malaysia-based AI and analytics firm Synapse Innovation to help with large-scale data projects.
The company is guided by two areas in its search for M&amp;As: market expansion and technology development, says Kamarul.
In the case of market expansion, Aerodyne‚Äôs foray into the Middle East began when it invested in Dubai-based Falcon Eye Drones in 2020. A similar pattern can be found in its investments in US-based Measure and Australia‚Äôs Sensorem.
Technology development for Aerodyne, on the other hand, involves acquiring companies that tout new tech. The Synapse acquisition is an example of how Aerodyne can upscale its current data analytics and AI technology, Kamarul adds.
Room to grow
Although much can be said about the progress in the sector, ‚Äúwe have barely scratched the surface with the commercial drone scene,‚Äù a senior tech veteran tells Tech in Asia.
‚ÄúThe good part is that those venturing into the drone space now have Aerodyne and others as benchmarks. But [new players] do not need to copy the group‚Äôs every move,‚Äù she says.
‚ÄúExcluding financial services, Malaysia has about 10 sectors where drones can be deployed, such as logistics and telco infrastructure. All we need is some creative people to do things that others have yet to do.‚Äù
For Wan Mohd Farhan, the industry advocate we spoke to, he recommends newer entrants to go into the services sector, such as agriculture, to sustain their businesses while developing R&amp;D applications within the industry or elsewhere.

Meraque CEO Md Razalee Ismail/ Photo credit: Meraque

Existing players like Meraque are already looking outside Malaysia to stay competitive. It‚Äôs ‚Äúlooking at M&amp;As and partnerships with key regional players while increasing our market share in Malaysia,‚Äù Razalee says.
Edotco, meanwhile, plans to set up its own team of in-house drone pilots, either organically or through an acquisition, the company says.
Wan Mohd Farhan also expects Malaysia to develop, test, and implement an unnamed traffic management system within the next 12 months, which he says will enable ‚Äúbeyond visual line of sight‚Äù flights.
‚ÄúThis will unlock opportunities for applications such as commercial drone delivery‚Äù as well as drone pods ‚Äì essentially docking stations where drones can be controlled remotely ‚Äì for autonomous asset inspection, monitoring, and security surveillance, he shares.
The traffic management system ‚Äúwill also set the basis for future drone sky highways similar to how airlines are currently operating globally,‚Äù he adds.
Aerodyne will certainly be there to snap up these opportunities. But, this time, other players will also be waiting in the wings.

Hi readers,
I recently took up baking to beat the pandemic blues. While it has been relaxing, the most difficult part was gathering the ingredients ‚Äì it always seemed like I was missing a few.
A few weeks ago, I came across an app that promised grocery deliveries within 10 minutes. I hadn‚Äôt even decided whether to bake a cake or just some muffins when the doorbell rang, and voila! My ingredients had arrived.
The super-quick service was impressive and piqued my interest as a financial journalist to figure out how the model really worked.
While experts questioned quick commerce‚Äôs economic viability, they all agreed that the service was undeniably attractive to consumers. The experts have tracked the evolution of the model and incorporated bits of it into their own businesses to avoid FOMO.
It‚Äôs also worth noting that the quick commerce delivery model has not yet found its feet in the US. In contrast, when we crunched the numbers, we found that Zepto, an Indian 10-minute delivery startup that came out of stealth mode in November 2021, is close to breaking even.
While the figures are promising, the impact of the model on delivery staff can be alarming in some cases. Apart from a swathe of challenges they face in India, delivery personnel have highlighted complaints from customers for being even two minutes late on an order.
This short delivery window also forces drivers to tread India‚Äôs pothole-riddled roads at dangerously high speeds.
The model is still in its infancy in India, and we‚Äôll have to wait and watch how it can be improved. For now, the big question remains whether these startups can balance convenience, economic viability, and driver safety.

Hello reader,
I recently decided to take the long Lunar New Year weekend to catch up on some shows. One of them was the latest season of Demon Slayer, the hit anime series about a young boy and his sister who go around, well, slaying demons in early 20th century Japan.
One of the key plot points in the show is the ongoing war between the Demon Slayer Corps (of which our protagonist is a part of) and the demons, led by their leader and the top echelon known as the Twelve Moons. With this season‚Äôs antagonist proving the most difficult one yet, it‚Äôs making me even more excited imagining what the eventual fight against the top-ranking demon will be like.
Today‚Äôs premium story, on the other hand, takes all the guesswork out of figuring out who‚Äôs at the top of Indonesia‚Äôs most funded startups and tech companies. With many strong contenders, any guesses as to which firm it might be?
Today we look at:


50 startups in Indonesia with the most money in their coffers
The India-based gaming studio that‚Äôs the recipient of an investment from PUBG developer Krafton
Other newsy highlights such as Endeavor Indonesia‚Äôs second cohort for its accelerator program and Canva‚Äôs latest acquisition.

Diving into Indonesia

If you‚Äôve been reading Tech In Asia for a while or are familiar with the Asian tech scene, many of the names on today‚Äôs listicle will no doubt be recognizable. Indonesia‚Äôs tech and startup scene boasts a number of behemoth unicorns and other rising stars, all of which are vying for a slice of the Indonesian market in their respective industries. Let‚Äôs dive in to see which of them are holding the biggest bags.


The big four: Out of the 50 companies that made our list, only four tech giants have recorded more than US$1 billion in funding, amassing US$8.9 billion in total. By contrast, the next closest competitor to the top four, online investing platform Ajaib, sits at US$243 million in funding.


A Kopious amount: Food and beverage might not have the biggest presence in our listicle, but grab-and-go coffee chain Kopi Kenangan is leading the way for its industry with US$205 million in disclosed funding over the last two years. The company raised this amount during its series B and series C rounds with the help of investors such as Kunlun Capital and Sequoia Capital.


Switching it up: Amid a deluge of edtech, logistics, and other common sectors, Tani Hub Indonesia stands out as the only agtech firm in our list. With over US$80 million raised in funding, the company runs both agriculture ecommerce site TaniHub and investment platform TaniFund.

Pumped by PUBG maker

In 2020, South Korean gaming giant Krafton, developer of PlayerUnknown‚Äôs Battlegrounds (PUBG), announced plans to invest US$100 million in India‚Äôs video game, e-sports, and entertainment industries. It recently made good on its word by investing US$5.4 million in Nautilus, a mobile game development studio based in the country.


The slate thus far: Krafton‚Äôs US$5.4 million investment in Nautilus makes it the first time the South Korean firm has pumped funds into an India-based gaming studio. The company has so far invested in gaming platform Nodwin, storytelling startup Pratilipi, audio dating app Frnd, and video game streaming platform Loco.


Playing ball: Zooming in on the recipient of these fresh funds reveals a gaming studio that develops and publishes cricket games. Founded in 2013, Nautilus was acquired by JetSynthesys, a digital entertainment and tech company, in October 2020. The Nautilus mobile app has recorded 100 million downloads and 10 million monthly active users so far.


Going the distance: With the additional capital in its pockets, Nautilus aims to expand into more markets and improve on its current offerings. In this area, the company plans to develop more games in addition to cricket. Nautilus is also looking to accelerate its growth in India and improve the overall gaming infrastructure in the country.

6Ô∏è‚É£ More people, more smartphones
China‚Äôs rising demand for smartphones is fuelling the revenue of US chipmaker Qualcomm, with the firm posting record first-quarter revenue on Wednesday.

Premium summary
Preparing for takeoff

Image credit: Timmy Loen

In 2022, rising inflation, heightened geopolitical tensions, a pandemic, global supply chain constraints, and the threat of higher interest rates have made investing a lot more tricky. However, that doesn‚Äôt appear to have stopped money from rolling into Southeast Asia.
With a large pipeline of funding for early-stage startups and a continued strong forecast for Southeast Asian exits between 2021 and 2024, global investors are finding some solace in the region.


One of a kind: Of the 50 startups in Southeast Asia that have recently raised funds, Kind Kones is unique. The Singapore-headquartered firm is the only one that sells plant-based ice cream. After its latest funding round, the company will make its vegan ice cream products available in supermarkets by the second quarter of the year.


Funding galore: We are all aware of the difficulty of raising venture capital funds for startups. However, companies in the edtech and fintech space are making it look easy, with over 20% of the recently funded Southeast Asian startups coming from these industries.


Dominant markets: Startups from Singapore and Indonesia make up more than 70% of the Southeast Asian startups that have recently raised funds. This is not entirely surprising, as the startup ecosystems in these countries are at a much more mature stage when compared to other relatively nascent markets such as Malaysia and Vietnam.

A silver bullet to save earth

Kyoto Fusioneering, a Japanese startup that develops equipment for the fusion reactor industry, has raised over 1.3 billion yen (US$11.6 million) in its series B round from investors including Coral Capital, JIC Venture Growth Investments, and Jafco Group.
The startup was founded in 2019 by Kyoto University professor Satoshi Konishi, one of the world‚Äôs leading experts on fusion engineering, according to Coral Capital.


Need of the hour: The firm aims to bring clean and sustainable energy to the masses by helping make commercial fusion a reality. Climate change is life-threatening to humankind, ‚Äúbut if the future of fusion energy is realized, it could become a ‚Äòsilver bullet‚Äô that saves the world,‚Äù said Yuki Kuwahara, principal of JIC Venture Growth Investments.


Taking on some debt: The company has also secured a loan of 700 million yen (US$6.1 million) from the Bank of Kyoto, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, and the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. The fresh funds will be used for R&amp;D, as well as developing fusion reactor heating equipment, heat extraction equipment, and fusion plant engineering.


Believers across the board: Several venture firms globally have already been established to help realize the potential of fusion reactors. In fact, one of the largest projects in the nuclear fusion space is the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, a plasma-based fusion reactor megaproject backed by a coalition of countries. These include China, India, Japan, the US, and South Korea, among others.

The partnerships will allow these SME platforms to use Decentro‚Äôs business-banking API to help MSMEs digitalize their operations and adopt a tech-driven approach to scaling their business.
Decentro caters to SME-facing platforms in India‚Äôs wholesale food, grocery, and retail categories.
Decentro‚Äôs platform enables owners of mom and pop stores to offer simplified payments through QR codes or UPI, instant settlements for suppliers and agents, and the linking of business bank accounts directly via APIs.
Additionally, Decentro provides an embedded finance offering, allowing SMEs to avail credit from non-banking financial companies.
‚ÄúConnected banking enables SMEs to utilize financial and banking solutions designed specially to suit their needs in a very native manner across these platforms,‚Äù said Rohit Taneja, founder and CEO of Decentro. ‚ÄúWith this new partnership, we are looking forward to empowering SMEs with advanced solutions that simplify and automate their processes.‚Äù
PagarBook is a bookkeeping startup that helps 8 million SMEs streamline financial record keeping and staff management. Meanwhile, Minko, whose clients include Unilever, Parle Agro, Coca-Cola, and Haldirams, aims to create an accessible credit line for offline retailers in India.

730828,2022-02-03T04:00:04,How manufacturing firms stand to gain from the next wave of industrial transformation,"The benefits of industry 4.0 have been plain for all to see. Technologies such as artificial intelligence and robotics have paved the way for greater efficiency and connectivity in business processes.
For Asia Pacific‚Äôs manufacturing industry, these digital transformations could prove to be a particularly huge boost ‚Äì business and government leaders in the region believe that the manufacturing industry will be one of the biggest beneficiaries of this fourth industrial revolution.
Why they believe this is not surprising: There have been rapid advancements in the sector over the years including using the internet to make manufacturing easier and harnessing alternative resources for sustainable production.
How can companies experience these benefits and gear themselves up for smart and sustainable manufacturing? This was one of the topics that was explored during the Industrial Transformation Asia-Pacific event organized by trade fair operator Deutsche Messe AG. The Agency for Science, Technology and Research (ASTAR), which is under the Ministry of Trade and Industry of Singapore, took part in the event, which was held on November 22 to 24 last year.
Securing supply chains
For manufacturing companies, supply chain management is set to rapidly advance with the help of industry 4.0, allowing firms to create resilient, responsive, and secure supply chains.
These advancements are critical because supply chains become more complex as firms get bigger and scale their output. However, these growing supply chains aren‚Äôt usually designed with transparency or resilience in mind, as businesses, which aim to maximize potential earnings, tend to focus more on efficiency, cost, and proximity to markets. This puts companies at risk of experiencing supply chain disruptions every 3.7 years due to shocks such as pandemics or financial crises. These disruptions could last a month or longer, with the most severe ones having a large financial impact.
This is where industry 4.0 practices come in. Data connectivity technologies ‚Äì such as the internet of things ‚Äì allow companies to link various supply chain stakeholders together and provide visibility throughout the chain. Additionally, firms can utilize a central control tower system ‚Äì a centralized hub containing end-to-end data in a supply chain ‚Äì to allow each stakeholder to share their own data.
‚Äú[This supplies] data in a form that is easily shared and understood by each party, and that creates resilience,‚Äù Alfred Huan, assistant chief executive of the Science and Engineering Research Council at ASTAR, explained during the event. Should a disruption occur, having visibility in the supply chain ‚Äì through solutions like a central control tower ‚Äì gives companies the ability to quickly identify the problem and rapidly respond to it using the appropriate data.

To help companies adopt these industry 4.0 practices and technologies, ASTAR kicked off its US$13.2 million Supply Chain 4.0 Initiative with its partners the National University of Singapore and the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD).
Tay Ming Hui, managing director of enterprise software provider PD Solutions, expressed support for the initiative: ‚ÄúWe look forward to co-developing solutions with ASTAR and implementing them for businesses. At the same time, we will enhance our domain expertise in supply chain technologies by taking up ASTAR training courses.‚Äù
As part of this initiative, ASTAR also worked with McKinsey &amp; Company to open a new supply chain control tower, which would act as a test bed to help businesses explore technologies that would make their supply chains more agile, resilient, and secure.
Supply chain optimization is vital to global companies, especially in volatile regions such as ours.
ASTAR hopes to use this control tower to demonstrate the potential of industry 4.0 solutions to its partners, allowing them to visualize the positive impact of these solutions on their own supply chain management systems. For instance, demand-sensing technologies can help companies recognize demand patterns and understand consumer behavior better, while other technologies like end-to-end simulations help to verify that the solutions being used work as intended.
According to ASTAR, more than 50 companies have already expressed interest in participating in the Supply Chain 4.0 Initiative, including Procter &amp; Gamble and Singapore-based enterprise software provider PD Solutions.
‚ÄúSupply chain optimization is vital to global companies, especially in volatile regions such as ours, where challenges from tariffs, trade policies, natural disasters, and pandemic lockdowns all play a role,‚Äù said Sam Garcia, senior vice president of supply chain at Procter &amp; Gamble Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Africa. ‚ÄúThrough collaboration with government bodies such as the Economic Development Board and ASTAR, we hope to forge stronger collaborations and innovations in integrated and sustainable technological solutions as foundations upon which agility and resilience can be built.‚Äù
Transforming sustainably
Another area in which industry 4.0 can provide massive benefits is sustainability. New technologies can help firms reduce their carbon footprint and impact on the environment and alleviate the effects of climate change. 3D printing, for example, can slash energy usage during manufacturing by 41% to 64%.
This is especially important, as business operations are at huge risk of adverse weather conditions due to climate change. For instance, research by McKinsey shows that by 2040, hurricanes will be 2x to 4x more likely to disrupt the supply chains of companies that rely on high-end semiconductor chips for their products.
By reducing their impact on the environment, manufacturing companies can help lessen the potentially disastrous effects of such adverse weather events and in doing so, ensure the stability of their own business operations.

To help companies understand how to apply industry 4.0 solutions in their sustainability efforts, ASTAR, together with Singapore government agency JTC and sustainability solutions provider Tuv Sud, developed the Green Compass initiative. The program offers a set of tools and training courses to help businesses achieve more environment-friendly and resilient business models.
Through this initiative, companies can learn how sustainable practices should be applied in each of their businesses, assess their current level of sustainability, prioritize the areas they should focus on, and plan a road map for environment-friendly transformation.
While developing the Green Compass Initiative, ASTAR and its partners focused on three key elements. First, it made sure that the framework would be relevant to companies of all sizes so that it could help different types of businesses. Next, the framework had to have the right balance of technical rigor and usability so that firms wouldn‚Äôt have difficulties in transitioning to more sustainable business models. Finally, the framework needed to be comprehensive enough to cover all the focal points of sustainable transformation.

During the Industrial Transformation Asia-Pacific event , ASTAR also showcased its Innovation Factory, a research and development center to help companies explore new sustainable technologies and practices with assistance from ASTAR. The Innovation Factory provides important resources such as equipment, workshops, ideation and consultancy assistance, as well as innovation projects that companies can experiment with.
On top of these efforts, ASTAR is exploring carbon capture and utilization methods, which involves recycling carbon dioxide emissions so that they don‚Äôt enter and harm the atmosphere. In this area, the agency is working with partners such as the Nanyang Technological University and Surbana Jurong to develop its Carbon Capture and Utilisation Translational Testbed (CCUTT). This initiative aims to provide early research data for carbon capture technologies, allowing companies to implement them quickly, flexibly, and cost-effectively.
The horizon of industry 4.0
In the coming years, McKinsey expects that further implementation of industry 4.0 practices in the manufacturing industry will generate outstanding opportunities. Improved employee productivity and product quality, among others, are just some of the ways industry 4.0 can revolutionize the future of supply chain management.
In the area of sustainability, the various initiatives by ASTAR and its partners could also help companies set up a path to sustainable operations and avoid ‚Äúbillions of dollars‚Äù in potential losses due to sustainability-related constraints.
‚ÄúWe want to bring the ecosystem of research performance and our partners in universities together in order to work with the industry, understand their problem statements, and help them deliver solutions to make them competitive,‚Äù said ASTAR‚Äôs Huan.

Hello reader,
Don‚Äôt put all your eggs in one basket. We‚Äôve heard the saying countless times before ‚Äì teachers and parents always have it handy. The idiom‚Äôs origin is believed to be from Miguel Cervantes‚Äô Don Quixote from the early 1600s.
More than four centuries later, the phrase is still relevant in society as a quick and easy way to dole out good advice. Ovo would agree. The Indonesian e-wallet has appeared to steadfastly implement this simple yet wise strategy.
Despite counting Tokopedia, one of Indonesia‚Äôs top ecommerce platforms, as its biggest driver of transactions, Ovo has cleverly cushioned any drop-off in business due to the merger of Tokopedia and Gojek to form GoTo Group. Ovo has reduced its dependence on Tokopedia by inking partnerships with other marketplaces, including Blibli, Zalora, and Lazada.
However, with Gojek‚Äôs solutions, such as GoPay, now hogging the limelight on Tokopedia‚Äôs platform, my colleague Jofie Yordan dives in deep to figure out if Ovo can preserve its status as Indonesia‚Äôs top e-wallet and if it really even matters, given that financial services are the monetization endgame for e-wallets.
Today we look at:

Ovo‚Äôs prospects of keeping its crown in Indonesia in light of GoTo‚Äôs rise
Scaler‚Äôs quest to become India‚Äôs next edtech unicorn

In it for the long haul

It is worth noting that Ovo does not have to fend off competition from GoTo Group on its own as the former counts Grab as a majority stakeholder. The Singapore-based super app bought a majority stake in Ovo from Tokopedia and Lippo Group last year.
This ensures that, despite the immediate threat from GoTo Group, Ovo has the resources to secure a spot among Indonesia‚Äôs top e-wallets in the long term.
‚ÄúE-wallet or mobile payments will not be a winner-takes-all market, and regulators will not let that happen,‚Äù Vion Yau, head of insights at research firm Momentum Works, explains. ‚ÄúEven in China, WeChat Pay and Alipay will not completely defeat each other because of their parents‚Äô use cases.‚Äù


Holding down the fort: While monthly active users don‚Äôt tell the full story regarding e-wallets, one third-party estimate shows that the figure has been steadily going up for Ovo. The trend has been apparent amid the Covid-19 pandemic and has held steady even after Tokopedia began shifting to GoPay.


Limiting damage: Ovo has taken steps to soften the blow from the Gojek-Tokopedia merger. The e-wallet remains a payment option on Tokopedia but is no longer in the most favorable spots. Furthermore, in line with its existing open-ecosystem strategy, Ovo is available on other ecommerce platforms, including Lazada and Blibli.


New avenues: Aldi Adrian Hartanto, vice president of investments at MDI Ventures, believes it‚Äôs likely that e-wallet players in Indonesia will start aggressively pushing their buy now, pay later products. Ovo, GoPay, and ShopeePay all offer BNPL. He notes that competition amid the from the cashback wars in the country‚Äôs Tier 1 cities is already ‚Äúbloody‚Äù, so Tier 3 and 4 cities are likely to be the next target for e-wallet players.

Hello readers,
Don‚Äôt put all your eggs in one basket. We‚Äôve heard the saying countless times before ‚Äì teachers and parents always have it handy. The idiom‚Äôs origin is believed to be from Miguel Cervantes‚Äô Don Quixote in the early 1600s.
Yet, more than four centuries later, the phrase is still relevant in society as a quick and easy way to dole out good advice. Ovo would agree. The Indonesian e-wallet has appeared to steadfastly implement this simple yet wise strategy.
Despite counting Tokopedia, one of Indonesia‚Äôs top ecommerce platforms, as its biggest driver of transactions, Ovo has cleverly cushioned any drop-off in business due to the merger of Tokopedia and Gojek to form GoTo Group. Ovo has reduced its dependence on Tokopedia by inking partnerships with other marketplaces, including Blibli, Zalora, and Lazada.
However, with Gojek‚Äôs solutions, such as GoPay, now hogging the limelight on Tokopedia‚Äôs platform, my colleague Jofie Yordan dives in deep to figure out if Ovo can preserve its status as Indonesia‚Äôs top e-wallet and if it really even matters, given that financial services are the monetization endgame for e-wallets.

The Big Story
Can Ovo, ‚Äòshunned‚Äô by Tokopedia, keep the crown?

While Ovo is still available as a payment option in Tokopedia, it is no longer in the most favorable position. But that may not matter in the long term. Read more.

‚ÄúStartups have emerged as a growth driver for the economy. Tax incentives for startups increased from three years to four years of incorporation, in view of the pandemic,‚Äù the minister said while presenting the union budget in parliament.
Indian startups had a blockbuster year in 2021, raising US$42 billion in 2021, up from US$11.5 billion in the previous year, and underscored the significance of the country‚Äôs tech ecosystem in the latest budget.
The country also minted a record number of unicorns last year, with their number going up to 78, according to data compiled by Tech in Asia.
Fine print for Indian startups
As part of the union budget, Sitharaman also proposed extending the startup tax-holiday scheme to those firms incorporated by March 31, 2023, over and above those startups already eligible for the exemption. The scheme gives startups a tax holiday for three out of seven years from the date of incorporation.
Earlier, the tax holiday was available for startups incorporated till March 2022. Last year, too, the minister had announced a similar one-year extension¬†to the startup tax holiday policy.

‚ÄúUnion Budget 2022 is extremely progressive and forward-looking in nature,‚Äù Jitin Bhasin, founder of fintech firm SaveIN, said. ‚ÄúEspecially for startups, the tax exemption to eligible startups, incorporated before March 31, 2023, is going to provide much-needed cash flow boost to startups in their formative years.‚Äù
Additionally, VC investors and startup founders are also likely to benefit from a tax tweak, where the surcharge on long-term capital gains tax has been capped at 15% for all listed and unlisted companies, lower than the earlier regime, where the surcharge went up to 37.5%
The government has also announced plans to set up a digital university, which will be based on a networked hub-and-spoke model. While the ‚Äúhub‚Äù refers to the country‚Äôs public universities and institutions, the ‚Äúspokes‚Äù are individual students who will learn from hubs at home through the digital medium.

The finance minister also said that the country‚Äôs agriculture and rural banks regulator will provide a fund with blended capital to fund agritech startups that are relevant to the value chain of farm produce.
The budget also included the launch of Kisan drones, which will be used for crop assessments, land records, and spraying of insecticides. Startups including Skylark Drones and ePlane Company will be potential beneficiaries of the move.
Meanwhile, electric vehicle firms will benefit from a new battery swapping policy, where batteries or energy as a service will be pursued as a separate model.
‚ÄúI would have loved if goods and service tax in battery and spare parts had also been reduced to 5%, similar to e-vehicle purchases.

731065,2022-02-01T10:53:19,India to launch digital rupee by 2023,"This story is co-reported by Deepti Sri.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), India‚Äôs central bank, is set to launch its own blockchain-based currency, the digital rupee, by 2023 as the country aims to introduce a cheaper and more efficient currency management system.
‚ÄúIntroduction of digital currency will boost the digital economy,‚Äù Nirmala Sitharaman, the country‚Äôs finance minister, said while presenting the union budget for the financial year 2022-2023 in parliament.

The move is likely to give an impetus to the participation of institutional players in the blockchain space.
‚ÄúThe development will make digital currencies more accessible to the people just as UPI (unified payment interface) made digital cash easier to use,‚Äù said Piyush Gupta, CEO of blockchain lending protocol Polytrade.
In November 2021, the Indian government said the RBI was working on a strategy to introduce a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in a phased manner after examining its use cases.
CBDCs will be a new form of digital cash intended to replace physical cash, according to a Morgan Stanley report.
‚ÄúEfforts to introduce CBDCs are gaining momentum, with as many as 86% of world central banks exploring their own digital currencies,‚Äù Chetan Ahya, chief economist and global head of economics at Morgan Stanley Research, noted in the report.
China has already been working since 2014 on a digital yuan, which is controlled by the People‚Äôs Bank of China.
Experts said apps and payments providers will likely begin preparations to offer services linked to the paperless Indian currency, as seen in China, where major digital payment apps support the digital yuan.
‚ÄúThere will likely be a similar model (as China‚Äôs) that will be seen in India to support adoption and use of the digital rupee, which is paramount for its success,‚Äù Harish Prasad, head of India banking at FIS, told Tech in Asia.
A digital rupee could also familiarize Indians with the benefits and efficiency of virtual currency. ‚ÄúIt will build an appetite for crypto, blockchain, and the multitudes of innovations and employment opportunities that these technologies are capable of fostering,‚Äù said Avinash Shekhar, CEO of crypto exchange ZebPay.
A crypto tax?
The finance minister also proposed a 30% tax on proceeds from digital assets. This could be seen as a step towards legalizing cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in India. The government will also tax the receipt of digital assets as gifts and their movement from one wallet to another.
The new regulation also states that losses from the sale of digital assets cannot be offset against other income.
‚ÄúWe hope that this development removes any ambiguity for banks, and they can provide financial services to the crypto industry,‚Äù Nischal Shetty, founder and CEO of crypto exchange WazirX, told Tech in Asia.
Meanwhile, Ajeet Khurana, venture partner at Blockchain Founders Fund and resident mentor of 500 Global, told Tech in Asia that the 30% tax rate ‚Äì which corresponds to the highest tax rate on personal income in India ‚Äì was ‚Äúreasonable.‚Äù
See also: Are state-backed digital currencies a game-changer?
On the flipside, the VC partner said investors in digital assets are prone to losing money from hacking and other cybercrime-related activities, and there is a need for clarification on how the government will help tackle such losses.
‚ÄúWe hope to work with the government to help bring crypto-asset taxation at par with other asset classes and participate in the central government‚Äôs vision to promote economic growth,‚Äù said Ashish Singhal, founder and CEO of crypto exchange CoinSwitch and co-chair of Blockchain and Crypto Assets Council.
India has 100.7 million crypto owners ‚Äì the highest in the world ‚Äì according to BrokerChooser, a broker discovery and comparison platform. The country is also fifth in terms of crypto owners as a percentage of population, with 7.30% of its citizens owning digital currencies.
‚ÄúI am now much more confident of sourcing crypto startups deals.

Unleashing the beast

Image credit: Timmy Loen

Fintech firm Lucy, which aims to support entrepreneurial women from economically weaker sections, tells Tech in Asia that it is currently in talks with investors to raise up to US$5 million in a series A funding round.
‚ÄúEmpowering women entrepreneurs to succeed is one of the biggest potential catalysts for economic growth in the ‚Äònew normal.‚Äô Lucy has been designed from the ground up to help them realize their potential, to grow, thrive, and shine,‚Äù Watkins says.


Community building: The Singapore-based firm will use the capital from the upcoming fundraise to roll out features such as a rewards program. It will also invest in developing its community platform by adding e-learning courses and a mentorship and coaching program. Watkins did not divulge Lucy‚Äôs growth figures but says the firm is ‚Äúgetting deep engagement‚Äù across its client segments.


Next stop, Hong Kong: Lucy will also expand to markets outside Singapore this year, with Hong Kong set to be its next stop. It also plans to set up shop in Indonesia and the Philippines and expand its current team of 12 employees. The new hires will be for its data analysis, product development, and cybersecurity teams.


No woman left out: Lucy‚Äôs platform addresses some of the key challenges that face less wealthy entrepreneurs. These include the lack of access to loans due to the absence of collateral and limited interest from mainstream financial institutions. Lucy also aims to aid female domestic help who don‚Äôt have a debit card or can‚Äôt easily wire money back to their native countries.

The man who asked his boss for a US$2 billion paycheck

Marcelo Claure/Photo credit: SoftBank

Yes, you read that right. Unsurprisingly, he did not get his payout, which led to a high-profile resignation from the ranks of SoftBank Group Corporation.
Marcelo Claure, the CEO of SoftBank Group International (SBGI) and the COO of SoftBank Group Corporation, left the company last week amid reports of a clash over compensation with company founder Masayoshi Son. This was not the first time the pair were at loggerheads, as they were also at odds over the spinoff of the company‚Äôs Latin American investment fund.


A dream payday: Claure was seeking nearly US$2 billion in compensation over the next few years. Son and other SoftBank executives, however, wanted to shell out a much smaller sum. Interestingly, Claure was already one of the highest-paid executives at SoftBank, having reportedly made US$17 million in 2020.


Au revoir, friend: Claure, who spent nearly nine years at SoftBank, rose through the ranks to become a close confidant of CEO Masayoshi Son. He also played a major role in SoftBank‚Äôs deals with startups like Uber and WeWork.


An apt appointment: Following Claure‚Äôs departure, Michel Combes, who served as president of SBGI, was appointed as its CEO. Combes joined SBGI in April 2020 and served on the boards of directors at SoftBank portfolio companies such as WeWork, OneWeb, SoFi Technologies, Contentsquare, Jellysmack, and Swile.

Graphene Ventures, which backed tech giants Snapchat and Lyft, led Retalio‚Äôs latest round. Investors like 500 Global, Agility, and Aujan also took part.
Meanwhile, the venture debt portion of the raise came from Nahda Fund, which is backed by Hong Kong-based IMM Investment Global.
Retailo aims to help small business owners by building a commerce platform where the B2B community can find a wide catalog of over 5,000 stock keeping units, which are delivered to their doorsteps in less than 24 hours.
The startup also allows small business owners to avail buy now, pay later services, as well as timely supply, competitive rates, and easy credit. Retailo also optimizes end-to-end logistics in the supply chain through its warehousing operations and smart fleet management solutions.
The company offers its sellers a cross-border distribution platform across the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan. It also provides data analytics tools to help sellers evaluate sales performance and consumption trends.
Former Careem executives Talha Ansari, Wahaj Ahmed, and Mohammad Nowkhaiz founded Retalio in July 2020.
‚ÄúAs global supply chains come under stress, pushing up commodity prices and depressing GDP growth, the value of smart supply chains becomes even more important,‚Äù said Ansari.
In the Middle East, the ecommerce market is expected to go past the US$27 billion mark by 2025, as more consumers turn to online channels for their shopping needs amid the¬†pandemic.
With the latest investment, Retalio has raised a total of US$45 million to date.

The fintech firm is conducting an investigation and audit over financial irregularities, with Grover and his wife under scrutiny. It has hired Alvarez &amp; Marsal, a management consultant and risk advisory firm, for the probe.
This investigation is supposedly looking at multiple discrepancies in invoicing and payments, as well as at transactions causing a conflict of interest. Meanwhile, Grover is currently on voluntary leave.

Accel, Matrix, and Falcon Edge‚Äôs Alpha Wave are reportedly leading the upcoming round in 100ms.

Premium summary
Stick a horn on it already!

Image credit:Timmy Loen

Indonesia is Southeast Asia‚Äôs second most prolific unicorn hub after Singapore. The largest archipelago in the world has 11 unicorns after adding six from last year alone.
While there‚Äôs no formal criteria for soonicorns, Tech in Asia looked at Indonesian companies that are valued above US$500 million. So far, eight homegrown startups fit the bill, and three of them are less than US$200 million away from hitting unicorn status.


Younger and quicker: While more mature startups like Ruangguru, Qraved, and SiCepat Ekspres took five to seven years before becoming soonicorns, younger companies are joining the club much faster. B2B marketplace GudangAda, for instance, sped past the US$500 million mark in just three years, while its competitor Ula achieved the same feat in less than two. Of course, it helps that B2B ecommerce is a hot space.


An exception: A company that we excluded from the soonicorn list but will likely be part of it sometime soon is Kredivo. The buy now, pay later startup‚Äôs US$2.5 billion SPAC merger has yet to take place, and its current valuation is US$456 million, according to VentureCap Insights.


A diverse set of backers: There are some investors that have more than one Indonesian soonicorn in their portfolio. These investors hail from 11 countries worldwide, perhaps indicating continued confidence in the size of Indonesia‚Äôs digital economy. About 47% of soonicorn backers are based in Indonesia and Singapore, while the rest are from outside Southeast Asia.

730858,2022-01-31T05:00:36,"Can Ovo, ‚Äòshunned‚Äô by Tokopedia, keep the crown?","When super app Gojek and ecommerce player Tokopedia merged to become GoTo Group, one of the first questions that came up was, what would happen to Ovo? The Indonesian e-wallet counts Tokopedia as its biggest use case driver.
Gojek had its own digital wallet in GoPay, and Ovo was affiliated with the decacorn‚Äôs archrival Grab. But there were also regulatory reasons: Bank Indonesia ‚Äì the country‚Äôs central bank ‚Äì does not allow any single entity to hold two e-money licenses simultaneously.
In January 2020, the strategy and timeline were still vague, though a gradual process seemed more likely than a clean break. Tokopedia, however, just made a major move towards the future: Gojek‚Äôs solutions are now front and center in the ecommerce platform.

Screenshot of GoPay in the Tokopedia app

Cashback points, for instance, are now offered in the form of GoPay coins. Meanwhile, many of Tokopedia‚Äôs app-wide discounts are given in exchange for using services like GoPaylater.
Ovo is still available as a payment option, but it‚Äôs no longer in the most favorable placements.
‚ÄúIn the coming month or maximum a year, it will begin to appear that Ovo‚Äôs [market] position will gradually decrease and possibly GoPay will take over,‚Äù says Aldi Adrian Hartanto, vice president of investments at MDI Ventures.

Ovo has taken steps to soften the blow. In line with its existing open-ecosystem strategy, the e-wallet is available as a payment option in other ecommerce platforms, including Lazada and Blibli.

Ovo is ‚Äú‚Äã‚Äãfurther expanding its use cases and driving adoption within the core payment business, as well as expanding its financial services verticals,‚Äù a company spokesperson tells Tech in Asia.
Still, it may not matter whether Tokopedia‚Äôs volume can be replaced, as long as Ovo succeeds in building a strong foundation of financial services, which is where the real money lies.
The strongest ecosystem wins
In a way, Ovo may have already lost its status as Indonesia‚Äôs top e-wallet by late 2020. A report from Ipsos and Bank Indonesia put then-newcomer ShopeePay as the leading e-wallet based on transaction values.

ShopeePay didn‚Äôt necessarily encroach on a rival‚Äôs turf since Ovo wasn‚Äôt available on Shopee, anyway. Losing Tokopedia, however, would affect Ovo differently. Not only is it being replaced by its close competitor GoPay, but Tokopedia is also one of Indonesia‚Äôs top two ecommerce platforms.
Tokopedia‚Äôs scale isn‚Äôt easily replaceable. According to estimates by research firm Momentum Works, the ecommerce firm‚Äôs gross merchandise value for 2020 was at US$14 billion. In comparison, even the regional business of Grab ‚Äì Ovo‚Äôs remaining backer ‚Äì is smaller at US$12.5 billion. Of course, Ovo is unavailable to Grab‚Äôs users in markets outside Indonesia.
Teaming up with Bukalapak may make some sense for Ovo, considering the burgeoning alliance between Grab and Emtek Group, a local conglomerate that has invested in the ecommerce firm. But Tokopedia‚Äôs scale is formidable: even combining Bukalapak and Lazada ‚Äì Indonesia‚Äôs other second-tier ecommerce platform ‚Äì would yield only about half of Tokopedia‚Äôs size.
Plus, even though Ovo is available on both platforms, it is not an exclusive arrangement as peers like Dana or LinkAja are also present on Lazada and Bukalapak.


Ovo‚Äôs advantage ‚Äì for now, at least ‚Äì is that it remains available on Tokopedia instead of being immediately phased out.
There‚Äôs also the Grab ecosystem in Indonesia, which seems to be the leader in both ride-hailing and food delivery. Momentum Works research estimates that in 2021, GrabFood got a 49% market share, outpacing GoFood‚Äôs 43%.
‚ÄúOvo still has the users [it had] acquired and retained over the years, and Grab is building up more use cases which Ovo will be part of,‚Äù explains Vion Yau, head of insights at Momentum Works.
Indeed, while monthly active users (MAU) don‚Äôt tell the full story when it comes to e-wallets, one third-party estimate shows that figure has been steadily increasing for Ovo. This is apparent amid the Covid-19 pandemic, and it remained stable even after Tokopedia began shifting to GoPay.

Yau adds that Ovo now focus on building its own financial ecosystem instead of being occupied with Grab or Tokopedia‚Äôs priorities. Financial services are the monetization endgame for e-wallets, and Ovo has been making strides into that space for some time now.

Operating as an independent player will allow Ovo to stay flexible. Yau says that based on feedback Momentum Works has heard from the ground, many users find Ovo to be more intuitive to use, unlike GoPay or ShopeePay, which are embedded in larger apps.
Ovo can also build more features with more flexibility compared with the embedded players.
‚ÄúYou can see trading stocks on the Ovo app, but it can be awkward to trade on the Gojek, Tokopedia or Shopee apps, for example,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúOvo‚Äôs prospects come down to how they are able to continue their lead position by building a digital finance ecosystem on top of Grab‚Äôs use cases.‚Äù
An uncertain future
Of course, things could still change moving forward. MDI Ventures‚Äô Hartanto believes that GoTo has no incentive to keep Ovo on the Tokopedia platform. The status quo is just a transition process benefitting Tokopedia consumers who are used to Ovo.
‚ÄúAt the moment, they just want to make sure people are getting used to GoPay, and they are trying to give more incentives to users who use it,‚Äù he observes. ‚ÄúIn the end, Tokopedia will reach a point where they see that their users are more comfortable using GoPay and are ready to cut off Ovo.‚Äù
Ovo will likely have some sort of tie-up with Grab‚Äôs digital banking ambitions. In late 2021, Emtek acquired Bank Fama International, and just last week, Grab and SingTel injected US$70 million into the Bandung-headquarted bank. The telco titan is also a partner in Grab‚Äôs digibank efforts in Singapore. And along with with Bukalapak, the super app had invested in Jakarta-based Allo Bank as well.

That said, it‚Äôs unclear where Ovo fits in all this. The company‚Äôs spokesperson did not comment specifically on the matter, but she said that Ovo will continue to focus on its core businesses of digital payments and digital financial services.
Similarly, the outcome of Ovo‚Äôs long-rumored merger with Emtek-backed Dana remains uncertain.
The combined company could have easily taken the pole position in Indonesia‚Äôs e-wallet race, but the deal appears to have been complicated by the failed Grab-Gojek merger. A source previously told Tech in Asia that the Ovo-Dana deal had only needed government approval, but it was put on hold due to negotiations at the parent level.
Ultimately, though, Ovo‚Äôs importance in the ecosystem remains secure.
‚ÄúE-wallet or mobile payments will not be a winner-takes-all market, and regulators will not let that happen,‚Äù Yau explains. ‚ÄúEven in China, WeChat Pay and Alipay will not completely defeat each other because of their parents‚Äô use cases.‚Äù

The Ovo app / Photo credit: Ovo

Hartanto agrees with that notion, adding that it‚Äôs likely that e-wallet players in Indonesia will start aggressively pushing their buy now, pay later products. GoPay and ShopeePay all offer BNPL. Ovo also once offered the feature, but it was removed in 2020.
He also sees that competition in the country‚Äôs Tier 1 cities is already ‚Äúbloody‚Äù from the cashback wars, so Tier 3 and 4 cities have the potential to be the next target for these e-wallet players. It‚Äôs a similar to the ecommerce playbook, where the likes of Mitra Bukalapak and Mitra Tokopedia aim to capture a group of still underserved markets.
‚ÄúThe majority of wallet shares in first-tier cities have been captured by all of the players. They already have their positions ‚Ä¶ and their own blocks,‚Äù Hartanto explains. ‚ÄúOther markets like the US or India are also starting to shift their competition to these uncharted territories.‚Äù",Jofie Yordan,Putra Muskita and Eileen C.

The development comes as the company looks to launch its own play-to-earn title, Everybody‚Äôs Marble: Metaworld, globally later this year. However, the game won‚Äôt be available in South Korea as local regulations bar the release of such games.
In the interview with Forkast, Kwon added that Netmarble is also looking to relist Itam Cube, the cryptocurrency of blockchain game developer Itam Games, on Upbit after the token was delisted from the exchange last year. Netmarble acquired Itam Games earlier this month.
Last year, Netmarble acquired Hong Kong-based casino game company SpinX Games in a deal worth US$2.2 billion. This allowed the South Korean firm to add the social casino genre to its library of games.

We break down the big and messy topics of Asia‚Äôs tech and startup community. Get the newsletter in your inbox everyday with a Premium subscription.
Hi readers,
I do the groceries in my household. It‚Äôs a weekly run that I used to enjoy.
I don‚Äôt revel in the process anymore because of a pandemic-induced paranoia toward crowded spaces, made worse by Malaysia‚Äôs lax enforcement of prevention measures. Authorities recently uncovered syndicates offering fake Covid-19 vaccination certificates. Yikes.
But my family still needs to eat. So I set a timer and try to complete my grocery run in under 30 minutes, which is still challenging.
But what if the entire process could be simplified? Maybe tap into an app, select groceries, pay, and choose to either get it delivered in less than 30 minutes or pick it up myself if I‚Äôm in the area.
That‚Äôs what quick commerce (q-commerce) offers, and, with dark stores, it‚Äôs become a reality today.
Foodpanda got a head start in the space with its dark stores, or Pandamarts, since 2019 ‚Äì well before Covid-19 ran riot. It has more than 50 Pandamarts in Malaysia, including in Sabah and Sarawak. It has also partnered with large hypermarket chains and hyperlocal favorites.
But the teething issue ‚Äì at least in my opinion ‚Äì is that Foodpanda doesn‚Äôt own a grocery store. That‚Äôs why Grab‚Äôs acquisition of Jaya Grocer, a Malaysian superstore chain, is interesting. Not only is it the ride-hailing giant‚Äôs first physical acquisition after its IPO, it‚Äôs also a move to capture a vital component of the grocery supply chain.
Jaya Grocer has the expertise in logistics, manpower, sourcing of food stuff, and that makes it easier for Grab to be a dominant player in the space.
That said, Jaya Grocer does not have a presence in East Malaysia. But I doubt this will be a longstanding problem.
Like all acquisitions, challenges and opportunities abound ‚Äì beyond the usual corporate buzzwords of ‚Äúcatalyst,‚Äù ‚Äúsynergy,‚Äù and ‚Äúscale‚Äù. The net effect of the Jaya Grocer acquisition is that it boosts Grab‚Äôs super-app ambitions.
But here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinking: Paranoid people like me may find themselves in the minority since Malaysia has eased travel restrictions. People will still want to go back to the good ol‚Äô days of physically shopping for groceries, which in turn might hurt the q-commerce blitz.
We have glimpses of that right now. For example, Google‚Äôs Covid-19 Community Mobility Report for Malaysia showed that trips made to supermarkets and pharmacies on January 12 were up 21% nationwide from the previous week.
If this trend persists, then q-commerce players will need a hedge. What better moat than a grocery chain where you can enjoy both online and offline purchases? That makes the Jaya Grocer acquisition a pretty good one for Grab, intentional or otherwise.

Hello reader,
CoLearn was already a late entrant to the Indonesian edtech market when it launched in 2018.
Ruangurru and Zenius, leaders in the sector, were already fighting it out for the top spot in the recorded-content space, so CoLearn decided to steer clear of that and explore live classes and AI-powered homework assistance instead.
Since then, other edtech firms, including Ruangguru and Zenius, have followed CoLearn‚Äôs lead. Despite that, it looks like its initial strategy has paid off as CoLearn closes a US$27 million series A round.
Now it plans to crack the problem of monetization. Though making money is a monumental challenge for edtech companies everywhere, CoLearn‚Äôs founder believes the firm is close to figuring it out.
Today we look at,

Indonesia‚Äôs CoLearn wraps up US$27 million series A

The Indonesian edtech firm closed a US$17 million extension series A round late last year, on top of the US$10 million it had raised in April 2021, said Abhay Saboo, CoLearn‚Äôs co-founder and CEO, in an exclusive interview with Tech in Asia.

With the new funding, the company looks to reach more students and their parents. It also plans to double down on its go-to-market strategy and monetization efforts.


Since its launch in 2018, CoLearn has consciously steered clear of the competitive recorded content arena and instead ventured into other spaces: live classes and AI-powered homework assistance ‚Äì two areas it now wants to ‚Äúdominate and own.‚Äù


At the moment, the startup makes money from its live classes, but it is now looking to focus on its go-to market strategy and monetization efforts ‚Äì and Saboo believes the company is close to cracking it.

Hello readers,
CoLearn was already a late entrant to the Indonesian edtech market when it launched in 2018.
Ruangurru and Zenius, leaders in the sector, were already fighting it out for the top spot in the recorded-content space, so CoLearn decided to steer clear of that and explore live classes and AI-powered homework assistance instead.
Since then, other edtech firms, including Ruangguru and Zenius, have followed CoLearn‚Äôs lead. Despite that, it looks like its initial strategy has paid off as CoLearn closes a US$27 million series A round.
Now it plans to crack the problem of monetization. Though making money is a monumental challenge for edtech companies everywhere, CoLearn‚Äôs founder believes the firm is close to figuring it out.

‚ÄúI am particularly grateful to Masayoshi Son, who gave me the opportunity to thrive at SoftBank and served as a mentor and friend during my tenure,‚Äù Claure said in a statement.
Michel Combes, who served as president of SBGI, has been appointed as its CEO following Claure‚Äôs departure.
Combes joined SBGI in April 2020 and served on boards of directors at SoftBank portfolio companies such as WeWork, OneWeb, SoFi Technologies, Contentsquare, Jellysmack, and Swile.
Before SoftBank, Combes was the CEO of US-based telecommunications firm Sprint. He also helmed other telecommunications companies such as Altice, Alcatel-Lucent, and Vodafone Europe.
A close aide and a fallout
Claure, who spent nearly nine years at SoftBank, had risen through the ranks to become a close confidant of CEO Masayoshi Son. He also played a major role in SoftBank‚Äôs deals with startups like Uber and WeWork.
‚ÄúClaure helped lead highly consequential projects over the last several years, including the turnaround of Sprint and the T-Mobile/Sprint merger, the successful repositioning of WeWork, the launch of Latin America‚Äôs largest venture capital fund, and the launch of the SB Opportunity Fund to invest in underrepresented racial minorities,‚Äù SoftBank added in the statement.
In recent months, Claure found himself at loggerheads with Son over compensation for his work, which includes the listing of the struggling WeWork.
According to reports, Claure had sought nearly US$2 billion in compensation over the next few years. Son and other SoftBank executives, however, wanted to shell out a much smaller sum.
Interestingly, Claure was already one of the highest-paid executives at SoftBank, having reportedly made US$17 million in 2020.",Kul Bhushan,Miguel Cordon and Lorenzo Kyle Subido,0,"['Management', 'News']",True,False,2

The the VC firm will continue to invest in startups that can combine financial services with other sectors such as logistics, health, and commerce.

729973,2022-01-28T06:35:12,Women-focused fintech firm eyes $5m series A funding,"Women-led startups got only 2.3% of global VC funding in 2020. While a greater share of funding went to startups run by women in 2021, the share still hovered around the 2% mark.
Singapore-based Lucy, a women-focused fintech startup, is looking to address these challenges of financing by offering personalized fintech solutions.
The company told Tech in Asia it is currently in talks with investors to raise up to US$5 million in a series A funding round.

In November 2020, Lucy came into the spotlight after it raised US$365,787 in  pre-seed round ‚Äì in which the investors were all women.
In August 2021, the firm raised US$1 million in a seed funding round from EmergeVest, a Hong Kong-based private equity firm. It also received an undisclosed sum by way of a grant from the United Nations Capital Development Fund last year.
Even though there are miles to go before the larger problem is solved for women entrepreneurs, Lucy aims to do its bit by supporting entrepreneurial women from economically weaker sections.
The financial empowerment of women can help alleviate overall poverty, according to an HBR report. The report also notes that a working woman keeps 90% of her income aside for her family ‚Äì significantly higher than the 35% that men invest into their families.

At the same time, women-led businesses are a relatively safe bet for investors. Women-founded startups generate 78 cents for every US dollar of funding ‚Äì almost 2x the average ‚Äì according to a BCG report.
Over her career spanning more than two decades, Debbie Watkins, CEO and co-founder of Lucy, encountered the lack of female representation in the entrepreneurial space. Watkins has worked in more than 35 countries and advised banks and other financial institutions on how to expand their outreach programs to underserved groups.
She observed that the management of these firms was mostly male. The proportion of business loans they were providing was also skewed toward men.
To address this gender gap, Watkins co-founded Lucy with Hal Bosher, ex-CEO of Yoma Bank and head of Wave Money, and Luke Janssen, founder and ex-CEO of Tigerspike.
Serving underserved women
Watkins describes Lucy as a neobank focused on providing a tailored range of financial and non-financial services to women.
While it strives to be inclusive to all women, Lucy‚Äôs objective is to serve women entrepreneurs who already have a business or are planning to start one.
The platform addresses some of the key challenges that face less wealthy entrepreneurs. These include the lack of access to loans due to the absence of collateral, as well as limited interest from mainstream financial institutions. Lucy also aims to reach out to female domestic help who don‚Äôt have a debit card or can‚Äôt easily wire money back to their native countries.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve designed products specifically to address the pain points of helpers, and home-based microentrepreneurs or individual microentrepreneurs,‚Äù Watkins told Tech in Asia.
Lucy has partnered with Mastercard to offer a prepaid ‚ÄúLucy Mastercard‚Äù that charges no fees and does not have a minimum balance requirement. Clients can have multiple cards to keep track of their money better.
For remittances, it allows users to send money in the Philippines and Indonesia at lower costs any time through their phones.
Lucy‚Äôs platform also allows users to create separate accounts for different purposes, such as allowing employers and employees to manage loans, among other things.

Expansion on the cards
Watkins did not divulge Lucy‚Äôs growth figures since its launch but said the firm is ‚Äúgetting deep engagement‚Äù across all of its client segments.
Watkins added that the company will use the capital from the upcoming fundraise to roll out additional features such as a rewards program. It will also invest in developing its community platform by adding e-learning courses as well as a mentorship and coaching program.
Lucy will also expand to markets outside Singapore this year, with Hong Kong set to be its next pit stop. It also plans to set up shop in Indonesia and the Philippines.
Watkins said that the company will also expand its current team of 12 employees. The new hirings will be across verticals, especially data analysis, product development, and cybersecurity.
Ahead of its imminent fundraise, the startup was selected as a finalist in the ‚ÄúFuture of Work‚Äù category at the 14th annual SXSW Pitch, formerly known as SXSW Accelerator.

730183,2022-01-28T06:00:43,How Indonesia‚Äôs Telkomsel is staying ahead of tomorrow‚Äôs needs,"Telkomsel, Southeast Asia‚Äôs largest mobile operator, is not taking its formidable position for granted.
As Indonesia‚Äôs incumbent telco, it was the digital gateway to some 173 million people in 2021, a marked increase from its 67% market share in Q1 2020. The 26-year-old corporation was also at the forefront of the archipelago‚Äôs transition from 3G to 4G and its more recent shift to 5G.
Despite its achievements, Telkomsel understands that ‚Äúbeing a telecommunications company is not enough to provide meaningful transformations for both today‚Äôs and the future‚Äôs generations,‚Äù says Derrick Heng, the company‚Äôs chief marketing officer.
Listening to the winds of change
Telkomsel sees the rise of over-the-top services like Spotify, Netflix, and WhatsApp as proof of the inevitable: Digital channels have become our primary route for connecting and engaging with the world. In light of this, it became clear to the telco that it had to modernize ahead of its users.

Derrick Heng, Telkomsel‚Äôs chief marketing officer / Photo credit: Telkomsel

Alongside the government‚Äôs push for the digital transformation of Indonesia‚Äôs businesses and citizens, Telkomsel has doubled down on its efforts to remain a key player in the country‚Äôs accelerating digital growth.
However, change can be intimidating and even be paralyzing for big corporations that serve millions of customers. To ensure that these large-scale changes were built and implemented holistically without impacting ongoing operations, Telkomsel worked with long-time partner McKinsey &amp; Company and its advanced analytics arm QuantumBlack.
A team of interdisciplinary venture builders, data domain experts, and strategy consultants planned how Telkomsel could better enable its customers to fully embrace today‚Äôs digital lifestyle.
Knowledge as foundation
The first and foundational change involved major upgrades to Telkomsel‚Äôs data systems, which essentially involved building a new data analytics platform. Today, the company‚Äôs upgraded capabilities boast ‚Äúmore than 9,000 data points available per consumer, fully modular and reusable across all business units,‚Äù says Heng. Automatic, quality-checked data pipelines and a new suite of AI-driven tools have also produced ‚Äú10x improvement in data quality.‚Äù
This gives Telkomsel a complete view of every customer, which can then be used to improve their experience across various touchpoints while also allowing for ‚Äúmore accurate and faster decision-making‚Äù at the company, adds Heng.
With its improved systems, Telkomsel was able to identify consumers who were still relying on 3G connectivity even as their data needs were growing. This was the company‚Äôs first step towards providing a better user experience (UX).
Meeting customers where they are
Updating its analytics also alerted Telkomsel to the fact that despite being the market leader, it lacked a digital-first brand association among younger users, who expect seamless digital experiences across multiple touchpoints and are very particular about which brands they choose to support. With Indonesia‚Äôs Gen Z segment already averaging 8.5 hours of data consumption a day, the telco‚Äôs second objective was to secure its relevance to these digital natives.

Photo credit: madebydubo/123rf

Telkomsel engaged experts from Leap by McKinsey, the consulting firm‚Äôs business building and scaling arm, in order to establish By.U, Indonesia‚Äôs first digital telco, from the ground up.
The team designed, built, and launched an all-digital customer experience ‚Äì from onboarding and quota management to top-ups and payments ‚Äì to reflect the spirit of the target consumers. That informed the development of By.U‚Äôs internal processes as well: a culture of agile processes that promotes collaborative working and a fit-for-purpose technological stack were put in place.
Heng notes how significant plays like this often come with unseen challenges. ‚ÄúThe early stages of our collaboration were very challenging, but there were many interesting and new things that we could learn from and use as a basis for improvement and development.‚Äù
For By.U, the debate revolved around whether to build slowly, or to take a minimum viable product (MVP) to market faster and finetune the product-market fit afterwards.
Ultimately, the team chose the latter route, creating a series of social media tests to observe clickthrough rates on features, which allowed them to develop an MVP quickly. The service debuted to around 30,000 customers on the pre-launch waitlist and then hit its one-year customer acquisition goal in just six months. Fifteen months after launch, By.U has over 2 million subscribers under its belt, with market-leading net promoter scores.
The complex path to simplicity
Telkomsel‚Äôs third transformation goal revolved around making customer interactions with the telco ‚Äúas seamless, convenient, and personalized as possible‚Äù ‚Äì a simple mission, but one that‚Äôs hard to execute. After initial attempts to improve the user interface of its existing mobile app, one thing became clear: A completely new app ‚Äì backed by an overhaul of supporting back-end systems ‚Äì was needed to fulfill the needs of increasingly digital-savvy customers.
Telkomsel bit the bullet and made changes to its core technological backbone, transitioning to a cloud-based architecture while simultaneously planning product development and commercial strategies. Features included higher transparency of customer usage through real-time monitoring and alerts, seamless digital payment options, and more brand partnerships, which the company believes will be instrumental to ‚Äúincreasing Indonesia‚Äôs digital economy,‚Äù according to Heng.
As a result, Telkomsel reports that its new app has netted 20 million downloads within a year of its launch and now handles 80% of the telco‚Äôs transactions.
All hands on deck
Although transformation begins with technology, the journey involves far more than that.
‚ÄúWithout the right skills and talent in place, no data or digital platform ‚Äì no matter how powerful ‚Äì would perform to its potential or withstand technological evolution,‚Äù Heng emphasizes.
To that end, the company‚Äôs transformation process included efforts to ensure that employee mindsets were tuned towards prioritizing purpose and agility. An agile recruiting process was also created to attract, onboard, and train Indonesian talents from the data science, software engineering, product ownership, and UX fields. This required a fresh approach to talent management, including new perspectives in employer branding, career paths for newer roles, and establishing an in-house academy for upskilling.

Heng credits the driving force of a fully aligned company for the success of this transformational push, along with shareholders, stakeholders, and strategic partners like McKinsey.
Constant vigilance
In a market like Indonesia, where wireless connectivity is necessary to ensure that wider territories have access to the internet, change and disruption will always be around the corner. The country‚Äôs digital economy to be worth US$125 billion by 2025, and competitors are already moving to claim as much as they can of that opportunity. Companies should expect disruption to be the new norm and constantly keep themselves ahead of the game ‚Äì a lesson driven home by the Covid-19 pandemic.
Telkomsel‚Äôs transformation push allowed it to react with speed and agility when the worst of the pandemic hit, ensuring that staff and consumers alike were able to go about their lives remotely while offering newly tailored services to serve a freshly evolved set of needs.
Not only does this demonstrate how constant innovation is critical, but it also shows that no company can afford to rest on their laurels. Telkomsel has made itself more resilient in the face of an unknown future.

Leap by McKinsey works with established organizations to imagine, build, and scale new businesses ‚Äì and develop the capabilities needed to do it again and again.

730713,2022-01-28T05:00:09,Counting Indonesia‚Äôs soonicorns and their backers,"
The founders of Lemonilo / Photo credit: Lemonilo

Indonesia‚Äôs billion-dollar startup club now has 11 members after adding six in 2021 alone, making it the second most prolific unicorn hub in Southeast Asia after Singapore.
And more might be coming. Behind the scenes, the Indonesian government has pushed for more startups to join the unicorn list. It recently launched the Merah Putih Fund, which is aimed at soon-to-be unicorns or soonicorns.
There‚Äôs no formal criteria for soonicorns, but for this piece, we looked at Indonesian companies that are valued above US$500 million. So far, eight homegrown startups fit the bill, and three of them are less than US$200 million away from hitting unicorn status.


Vidio is one example. The Emtek Group-backed entertainment site‚Äôs valuation reached US$900 million after its first external funding in November 2021. At the time, its pre-money valuation was US$750 million, but it is unclear how long the company had been hovering around that number.
A company that we excluded from the soonicorn list but will likely to bypass it sometime soon is Kredivo. The buy now, pay later startup‚Äôs US$2.5 billion SPAC merger has yet to take place, and its current valuation is US$456 million, according to VentureCap Insights.
Another fintech company to watch is LinkAja. Although its valuations are not public, the e-wallet is backed by a bunch of state-owned enterprises and unicorns like Grab and Gojek. It‚Äôs popular in Indonesia‚Äôs Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities.
See also: A list of SEA‚Äôs soonicorns and their early backers
We also found that while more mature startups like Ruangguru, Qraved, and SiCepat Ekspres took five to seven years before becoming soonicorns, younger companies are joining the club much faster.
B2B marketplace GudangAda, for instance, sped past the US$500 million mark in just three years. Its close competitor Ula achieved the same feat in less than two.
Of course, it helps that B2B ecommerce is a hot space. Both Ula and GudangAda target warungs or traditional mom and pop shops, which account for the majority of domestic retail transactions. These companies have also expanded further with new initiatives such as Ula‚Äôs credit product and established plans for international expansion.
Just months after its series A funding in 2021, Ula moved to the next round with injections from big investors, including Tencent and Amazon honcho Jeff Bezos.


We also look at the investors backing these companies, and some of them already have more than one soonicorn in their portfolio.
These investors hail from 11 countries worldwide, perhaps indicating continued confidence in the size of Indonesia‚Äôs digital economy. About 47% soonicorn investors are based in Indonesia and Singapore, while the other 53% are from outside Southeast Asia.
Soonicorn founders also come from various countries. The graphic below features founders and co-founders of Indonesian soonicorns, along with their positions in the companies they‚Äôve founded.


Many of these co-founders were colleagues at previous companies. Ula‚Äôs Nipun Mehra and Alan Wong worked for their now-investor Jeff Bezos at Amazon, while Qraved‚Äôs co-founders worked at global incubator Rocket Internet and are also managing tech developer Imaginato.
Lemonilo‚Äôs co-founders initially built medtech startup Konsula upon returning from their study in the US. But East Ventures-backed Konsula only lasted a year, hampered by stagnant growth and tight competition.
See also: A list of SEA‚Äôs unicorns and their early investors
In the future, it‚Äôs likely that more startups will hit soonicorn status faster, especially in industries that have benefited from the pandemic like ecommerce, transport, and fintech.
‚ÄúThe digital media industry also has great potential, along with the growing demand for entertainment,‚Äù says Paulus Jimmy, an equity research analyst at Sucor Sekuritas.
This is backed by projections from Google, Bain, and Temasek in their report released in November, which also predicted that Indonesia‚Äôs internet economy value will reach US$146 billion by 2025.
According to Robertus Hardy, head of research at asset management firm Henan Putihrai Sekuritas, plenty of soonicorns will emerge ‚Äúvery soon‚Äù in Indonesia, given the possible abundance of liquidity in private market funding.
However, regulatory risks could derail Indonesia‚Äôs soonicorn growth trajectory, especially the omnibus law, which was recently deemed unconstitutional. If the government fails to revise the law within two years as expected by the Constitutional Court, then foreign investors may hesitate to pour in money, explains Hardy.
Another setback could be the execution risk, since ‚Äúthe sustainability of Indonesian startups in its early stage is still quite low compared to other countries,‚Äù he adds.

Hello readers,

How Ula is helping warung owners sell more

Premium summary
What‚Äôs your favorite thing to buy from a warung?

Besides comic books, my childhood mom and pop store also sold a treasure trove of snacks and goodies. Jack ‚Äòn Jill potato chips hold a special place in my heart, as do the ice lollies. Also, once I started following football, that mom and pop store was the place to go to pick up my copy of the tabloid newspaper that had the best sports coverage back then.
A wide selection can do so much for a neighborhood store ‚Äì not the least of which is giving its customers many happy memories. And Indonesia‚Äôs Ula is helping the country‚Äôs warungs expand their offerings and bring in more income through its new feature.


I‚Äôll be there for you: Called Teman Ula ‚Äì or ‚ÄúUla‚Äôs friends‚Äù in English ‚Äì the new social commerce service allows small neighborhood retailers in the firm‚Äôs ecosystem to offer more products than what they usually provide by aggregating demand from its customers for other products.


Ride on time: The company‚Äôs current infrastructure allows it to deliver packages at the exact time when warung owners want them. This, co-founder Nipun Mehra says, is a very important aspect of the business, as it helps keep end customers loyal to merchants.


Go West: Currently, Teman Ula is available in East Java, where Ula started its operations and where its infrastructure is mature. However, the company aims to expand Teman Ula to Central Java and West Java in the near future.

If you‚Äôre not a subscriber, get access by registering here.
Hi there,
The Lunar New Year is just around the corner, and here in Vietnam, consumer demand usually spikes through the roof before all stores close for several days.
The gig economy goes into full swing as we gear up for this holiday, which is locally known as T·∫øt. Riders in their Grab or Gojek uniforms have been dotting the streets to fulfill orders. But as customers, we often take these delivery services for granted.
Consumers around the world are getting lazier and less patient, giving rise to quick commerce, which offers to deliver groceries at your doorstep within 10 minutes.
How is this possible? I can‚Äôt even figure out my grocery list in that amount of time.
But as we all know, tech companies love to tackle the impossible and they‚Äôre scrambling to ride this wave. Outside the US and Europe, the quick commerce race is intensifying in India.
In this week‚Äôs Big Story, my colleague Deepti analyzes the competition among Indian players like Zepto, Dunzo, SoftBank-backed Blinkit, and Swiggy‚Äôs Instamart.
Her in-depth report explores the 10-minute delivery model‚Äôs economic sustainability and the human cost of this seemingly magical service.

THE BIG STORYWill India‚Äôs 10-minute quick commerce model last?

Image credit: Timmy Loen

The 10-minute delivery is taking India‚Äôs ecommerce industry by storm. But is the business model viable in the long term?

THE HOT TAKECan Thrasio beat its clones in India?

Photo credit: Thrasio

Here‚Äôs what happened:

US-based Thrasio officially entered India earlier this month by acquiring Lifelong Online, which designs and builds home products for consumers. The ecommerce aggregator giant reportedly paid US$150 million to US$200 million for the deal, its first acquisition in the country.
Thrasio‚Äôs CEO noted that India is a ‚Äúlong-term bet.‚Äù Half a billion dollars have been set aside as ‚Äúa baseline commitment‚Äù and part of Thrasio‚Äôs China manufacturing will be moved to India.
The US roll-up major‚Äôs India debut comes at a time when its model has been cloned by local startups at an unprecedented pace. For instance, GlobalBees and Mensa Brands joined the unicorn club within a year.

Here‚Äôs our take:
Thrasio is one of the pioneers in rolling up ecommerce brands, particularly third-party sellers on Amazon. In just three years, it has popularized the business model to the point where hundreds of similar startups are operating worldwide.
In March 2021, Tech in Asia saw how the trend was picking up and soon after, it spilled over to Southeast Asia. Thrasio-style firms like Rainforest and Una Brands began springing up in the region.
With a valuation of at least US$5 billion, Thrasio has become a beast with an enormous appetite. It‚Äôs reportedly buying 1.5 businesses a week and has amassed a portfolio of about 200 brands.

Marketplace Pulse estimates that Amazon aggregators worldwide raised about US$12 billion in 2021. / Image credit: MarketplacePulse

There‚Äôs a roll-up frenzy in India; we estimate that nearly US$1 billion has been poured into local players within a couple of years. Mensa Brands and GlobalBees lead the pack in terms of funding raised, bagging about US$300 million each (counting both equity and debt).
Why India? The short answer is that it‚Äôs potentially a massive market. RedSeer Consulting projects that by 2030, the Indian online retail market will become the world‚Äôs third largest after the US and China. The country is also undergoing a revolution in direct-to-consumer brands, fueled by pandemic-induced demand.
With Thrasio now in the arena, the roll-up race in India is bound to go up a notch.
Clearly, Thrasio isn‚Äôt guaranteed a smooth ride in the country. Despite growing fast, ecommerce as a share of India‚Äôs entire retail market is still relatively low and is expected to reach 7.8% in 2022, according to eMarketer.
The US roll-up major was credited with creating the Amazon aggregator category. The model works because Amazon can provide aggregators with quick access to transparent data on third-party sellers. That is often not the case with other marketplaces or D2C brands.
Unlike its pole position in the US, Amazon doesn‚Äôt dominate in India despite having invested about US$6.5 billion since 2013. The US tech behemoth has been facing mounting regulatory pressures in the South Asian country.
Third-party sellers on marketplaces like Flipkart and Nykaa or D2C brands can be attractive acquisition targets, but the model has to be localized.
In fact, GlobalBees has snapped up 15 D2C brands in just months. Its CEO noted that the company doesn‚Äôt want to model itself after Thrasio, adding that its brands will also operate brick-and-mortar stores. In fragmented markets like India, taking the omnichannel approach is the way to go.
In its home turf, Thrasio itself is teaming up with brick-and-mortar retailers, signaling the growing importance of physical stores even for digital-first brands.
But it might not have the early-mover advantage in India, where in some cases, a bunch of buyers are vying for the same assets. This means higher valuations can be a roadblock to Thrasio India‚Äôs acquiring spree. The heated market could drive brand founders to rush towards the exit door without building strong fundamentals for their businesses.
Nonetheless, Thrasio‚Äôs entrance is expected to trigger consolidation in India‚Äôs roll-up playground.
The company has tasked the co-founder of Lifelong, its local partner, to lead the operations for Thrasio India. If things go well, Southeast Asia could be its next target.

Several players are vying for a piece of India‚Äôs US$300 million quick commerce pie, which is expected to hit US$5 billion by 2025, according to a RedSeer Consulting report.

Zepto, Dunzo, SoftBank-backed Blinkit, and Swiggy‚Äôs Instamart are all racing to hire staff, open stores, and grab a foothold in the red hot market.¬†
Tech in Asia has reported on investors‚Äô big bets on dark stores amid the adoption of the quick commerce model in India and Southeast Asia.
But¬†Kalyan Krishnamurthy, Flipkart‚Äôs CEO and Tiger Global‚Äôs former managing director, has played down the surge of rapid grocery deliveries in India. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the right long-term customer model,‚Äù he told The Economic Times in a recent interview, referring to the 10-minute delivery trend.
He added that Flipkart was looking at a more sustainable model that fulfills deliveries within 30 to 45 minutes.
At present, the Walmart-backed Indian ecommerce giant offers Flipkart Quick, a service that guarantees deliveries within 90 minutes.¬†
Tech in Asia spoke to several industry experts in India to understand how economically sustainable the 10-minute delivery model is.
Is it viable?
Players like DoorDash, Gopuff, Jokr, Getir, Buyk, Gorillas, and Fridge No More dominate the instant delivery space in the US.

However, ‚Äåthe unit economics for these firms are underwhelming. As of August 2021, Jokr was reportedly losing US$159 per order in the US despite being ‚Äúoperationally profitable‚Äù in the first few cities where it was launched.
Similarly, Gopuff is also loss-making at an operating level, though it says it is ‚Äúcontribution profit positive.‚Äù
In a bid to boost margins, Jokr is now mulling the introduction of longer delivery times and private-label products. Gopuff is also looking at pursuing a similar strategy.¬†
While India‚Äôs quick commerce market is still nascent, it could potentially buck the trend in US and crack the unit economics, given the traction it is currently seeing.¬†
‚ÄúI respect the Flipkart management, but I beg to differ,‚Äù says Dimpy Dewan, a former Paytm executive and co-founder of Hanchens, an enabler of quick commerce.
Hanchens is helping set up dark stores for Tata-backed¬† healthcare firm 1mg and others like social commerce player DealShare, produce-focused startup Fresh to Home, and B2B platform Udaan.
While stakeholders in the online grocery delivery space believe that the best way to acquire customers is to shorten delivery times, several industry experts question the model‚Äôs viability in the long run.
‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre offering free delivery, of course people will pick it up. But can you sustain it?‚Äù asks Anup Jain, managing partner at Orios Venture Partners, an early-stage VC firm.
He points out that products sold on online delivery platforms don‚Äôt offer wide enough margins to sustain a business in the quick commerce space.

However, Swiggy has a competitive edge as its instant delivery arm benefits from an existing pool of consumers already served by its food delivery business.
Online grocers make money on orders in two ways: ‚Äåproduct margins and delivery fees.
Currently, Zepto and Blinkit do not charge delivery fees. On the flipside, Swiggy‚Äôs Instamart charges a minimum of 15 rupees (US$0.20) per order and Dunzo a minimum of 25 rupees (US$0.34) per delivery.¬†
The experts unanimously agree that all online grocery firms will soon start charging delivery fees to compensate for the thin margins.
‚ÄúZepto, Blinkit, and BigBasket, among others, are currently selling products at a minimal product margin,‚Äù a food and delivery expert tells Tech in Asia.¬†
The expert says that once online grocers operate at a larger scale, they could also potentially negotiate more favorable margins from retailers.¬†
The cost of delivering an order depends on the distance between a dark store and a customer‚Äôs address as well as the amount of time it takes to complete the delivery.
For example, a consumer is charged about 15 rupees if they choose to receive an order via Swiggy‚Äôs Instamart in 20 to 25 minutes. After accounting for product and delivery costs, Swiggy would likely earn between 8% to 12% of the order value on deliveries within a 1 kilometer radius, according to the expert.¬†
However, online grocers could benefit from combining multiple deliveries, which could cut transportation costs by half.¬†

If companies can drive large enough volumes from dark stores, it could reach a point where each dark store is profitable, the expert adds.
The expert also says that most companies have a limited amount of inventory at the moment.
In our previous coverage, we found that it cost about US$30,000 to¬†set up a dark store, which translates to around US$9 million for 300 stores.¬†

Blinkit founder Albinder Dhindsa recently told The Economic Times that the path to profitability for quick commerce hinges on two volatile factors: competition and execution.

Blinkit currently operates 250 dark stores and plans to run 550 by the end of January. Tech in Asia reached out to the firm, but it did not clarify whether it has already opened 300 more stores.
Notably, the push to make quick commerce profitable comes against the backdrop of offering deep discounts to attract customers.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see why grocery delivery firms won‚Äôt be going for aggressive discounting practices for the foreseeable next six to nine months,‚Äù the food and delivery expert says.
A company needs to deliver about 1,000 orders per day to¬† hit break even at a dark store, according to a top executive from an Indian grocery firm.
Blinkit has been delivering about 125,000 orders daily. Considering that each of its 250 dark stores delivers about 500 orders per day on average, it is likely halfway to breaking even.¬†
Zepto has 100 dark stores; each has the capacity to deliver over 2,500 orders per day.¬† The company could reportedly hit 100,000 orders a day by the end of January, which would bring it to the verge of breaking even on a per store basis.
Cracking the hyperfast delivery model
These online grocers operate a network of dark stores, which often limit deliveries to a mile and a half or less. Each dark store typically stocks between 1,500 and 5,000 items, compared with 35,000 products typically available at a supermarket. These dark stores are not open to the public for direct retail.

To make the pickup process efficient, items at a dark store are placed on the most optimal routes for store personnel. Companies also use location intelligence to set the network of dark stores closer to customers, based on the density of demand in an area.
With investors funding the operations for now, online grocery firms offer free or low-cost delivery and avoid marking up prices by keeping their overheads low, executives from three delivery companies told Tech in Asia on condition of anonymity.


Some of the overhead costs that online grocers incur include procurement, packaging, rent, and maintenance for dark stores as well as compensation for store and delivery staff.¬†
Quick commerce firms buy products in bulk directly from manufacturers and suppliers, while saving on rent because their hubs are small and do not need to be at prime locations.¬†
Zepto selects micromarkets based on factors like the density of consumer demand, road patterns, traffic data, last-mile supply availability, and real estate prices. It builds its own datasets and models to do this.
Online grocers also maintain tight control over inventory to minimize waste and don‚Äôt employ staff to assist consumers in person or help them check out.
An order is typically dispatched from Zepto‚Äôs dark stores within 58 seconds, co-founder Aadit Palicha tells Tech in Asia.
‚ÄúIf you have an efficient internal process, your outflow can be much faster than a traditional retail store or a traditional ecommerce warehouse,‚Äù he adds.
A model only for metros
‚ÄúThe concept of 10-minute deliveries is not valid for small towns in India. Meanwhile, consumers in top cities are time-poor and have a certain amount of disposable income,‚Äù says Orios Ventures‚Äô Jain.

He adds that consumers in high-end neighborhoods may be willing to pay a delivery fee. However, a mid-sized grocery store may be better suited to serve low-to-middle income localities.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm bullish on the quick commerce model from a Tier 1 city perspective,‚Äù says Akshay Bhushan, partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners. The VC firm also backs Astro, a quick commerce firm based in Indonesia.
He also believes ‚Äåhyperfast deliveries are likely to succeed in ‚Äålocal and mature markets, where the consumer demand is high.
‚ÄúI‚Äôd say there‚Äôs a very clear product-market fit for higher income consumers, but I think the proposition has to be modified for other consumer segments,‚Äù Bhushan adds.
Challenges to speedy delivery
Consumers‚Äô consumption patterns will change if inventory at dark stores is not constantly stocked and updated based on varying needs, another industry expert explains.
The expert adds that a consumer may prefer to shop at traditional stores if they struggle to find everything they need on a single platform, disregarding the shorter waiting time.

Meanwhile, Hanchens‚Äô Dewan says the biggest challenge for quick commerce isn‚Äôt operations but mindset.¬† For instance, when consumers are used to paying a specific price for delivery, they might not accept a hike.
‚ÄúWhen it comes to the cost of delivery, online delivery firms should not be penny-wise and pound-foolish,‚Äù Dewan added. ‚ÄúA delivery fee is eventually going to make its way to users.‚Äù
Meanwhile, the short delivery windows in quick commerce also put a lot of pressure on delivery staff, who have to navigate India‚Äôs pothole-riddled roads, where cattle and other animals regularly stray into traffic.
Last year, the World Bank said that India‚Äôs roads saw one death every four minutes, while road accidents kill about 150,000 people in the country¬†each year.
Tech in Asia spoke with eight delivery personnel who work for online grocers in India. They said they were constantly under ‚Äåpressure to rush their orders, highlighting the dark side of the country‚Äôs gig economy.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve had to deal with angry customers who had complained of a two-minute delay, and they don‚Äôt accept any justification from my end,‚Äù a delivery person told Tech in Asia on condition of anonymity. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve had some of my worst days when an order has been dispatched with incorrect items in them.‚Äù
However, Zepto told Tech in Asia that it offers no incentives on deliveries under 10 minutes. It also doesn‚Äôt penalize those that take longer than that.
Some delivery riders say they prefer working with Zepto and Blinkit as the firms give them many orders from specific locations, making it easier on their pockets.
‚ÄúOur riders are not (dis)incentivized to deliver fast. They do it at their own pace and rhythm,‚Äù Blinkit‚Äôs Dhindsa said in a Twitter post last year. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had zero reported rider accidents in the last two months since we launched 10-minute grocery delivery.‚Äù
However, Tech in Asia has viewed a WhatsApp group where delivery personnel ‚Äì including those from Zepto and Blinkit ‚Äì regularly air their grievances. Troubles such as minor accidents, charging a penalty against consumer complaints, and pressure from immediate bosses at dark stores were brought up in their conversations.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm fed up with the constant complaints from my store manager,‚Äù one of the delivery staff said on the WhatsApp group. ‚ÄúWhat can I do about roadblocks, which make me take longer routes?‚Äù
Despite the challenges that face delivery staff, a surge in demand for quick commerce has pushed investors to stay committed to the emerging model.
The road ahead
‚ÄúI will not be surprised if we see another 1,000-plus investments happening in the next one to two years into the direct-to-consumer space, which is also enabled by quick commerce players,‚Äù says Dewan.
After Blinkit hit the US$1 billion valuation mark in 2021, a VC backing an Indian grocery firm also mentions the possibility of a unicorn coming up in the space this year.

However, India‚Äôs quick-delivery firms are also expected to go through cycles of high and low discounting, depending on investor climate.
The country‚Äôs startup ecosystem has been on a bull run over the past few months, with larger ticket sizes¬†for investments flowing into these quick commerce firms.
‚ÄúThe potential softening of US tech stocks could affect private equity markets, venture capital, and growth-stage investors, affecting quick commerce companies as well,‚Äù an Indian VC firm executive tells Tech in Asia.
However, the executive adds that there could be further investment into quick commerce companies, with existing players aggressively expanding their operations until their unit economics hit a low point.",Deepti Sri,Collin Furtado and Arpit Nayak,0,"['Analysis', 'Ecommerce', 'Premium Content', 'Startups']",True,True,11

Even before the crackdown, Alibaba and Tencent had been jostling in Southeast Asian markets for some time. From 2014 to 2021, the firms have either led investments or co-invested with regional and international investors across a total of 41 funding rounds, worth US$20.6 billion.
However, facing significant regulatory hurdles in the Chinese market, the Alibaba-Tencent rivalry looks likely to spill over into key battlegrounds abroad.


Rivalry heats up?: While previous analysis found the two competing for investments in only the fintech sector, Tencent entered ecommerce with three investments in late 2021: Singapore-based collectibles e-tailer Mighty Jaxx, Philippine B2B platform Growsari, and Indonesian ecommerce marketplace Ula.


Drawing battle lines: Tighter financial regulations from Beijing could also limit room for growth in fintech, forcing Tencent and Alibaba to eventually compete in other industries. ‚ÄúFintech is a growing area, but it‚Äôs harder to get market share, as many governments would like to control domestic financial flows,‚Äù said Andrew Collier, Orient Capital Research‚Äôs managing director.


Open to risk: While the two companies preferred late-stage and strategic investments before 2020, Tencent is now looking at backing more fledgling firms. Cumulatively, a little over 77% of all funding rounds that both companies participated in from 2014 to 2019 were late-stage or strategic investments. That figure fell to 58% after 2020.

Darwinbox, an HR-focused SaaS firm, has entered the coveted billion-dollar club and reached unicorn status after raising US$72 million in a series D round led by Technology Crossover Ventures. To date, the firm‚Äôs has raised a total of over US$110 million.
Founded in 2015, the Singapore-based firm enables enterprises to centralize all of its human resources processes, from hiring and payroll to employee management and benefits tracking.


Rapid growth: The software-as-a-service company said it has seen a 300% growth in demand in the past year, with its product being used by 1.5 million employees across more than 650 enterprises, including regional firms like Zalora, Tokopedia, JG Summit Group, and Zilingo, as well as international brands like Starbucks, Nivea, and Axa.


Widening influence: Darwinbox is aiming to strengthen its presence in Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, and the Philippines. It is also eyeing the Middle East and Japan as potential opportunities. ‚ÄúSuddenly, there was a lot more interest among companies to look at HR technology to automate their activities,‚Äù Darwinbox co-founder Rohit Chennamaneni told Tech in Asia.


Key insights: Chennamaneni said that the system could notice employees‚Äô level of engagement based on multiple touchpoints, allowing stakeholders to take actions guided by data. Due to the vast amount of data being generated, it is easy to find patterns in order to ‚Äúmake more predictive decisions, where you need to intervene at the right time,‚Äù he said.

Existing investors including Sequoia Capital‚Äôs Surge, AC Ventures, GSV Ventures, TNB Aura, S7V and January Capital also participated in the new round.
At the start of the pandemic, edtech adoption in Southeast Asia‚Äôs largest market jumped threefold from 6 million users in January to August 2019 to 20 million users the following year, according to a study conducted by Google, Temasek, and Bain &amp; Company. But the recent investment serves as a validation of CoLearn‚Äôs view on the future of education in post-pandemic Indonesia.
‚ÄúParents will realize the best combination [for their children‚Äôs education] is offline school and online private tutoring. School going back offline will be a positive thing for this industry,‚Äù Saboo says.
Latecomer‚Äôs advantage
Saboo co-founded CoLearn with Marc Irawan and Sandeep Devaram in 2020, but the firm‚Äôs journey began even before then.
In 2018, the company initially started with an offline model, establishing itself as a ‚Äúsmart center‚Äù that hired top educators to offer supplementary English, mathematics, and coding classes to students.
These centers proved to be successful and became profitable quickly, says Saboo, but scaling such a brick-and-mortar business was a challenge. Going hybrid was one option, but when Covid-19 hit, the decision became an easy one: The company went fully online.
The next big decision for the firm would be related to its product offering.

Acknowledging that CoLearn was a ‚Äúlatecomer to the party,‚Äù Saboo and his co-founders had to be mindful of the existing players in the market. Ruangguru and Zenius, two household names in the K-12 segment, were fighting it out in the recorded content arena, he says, so the company steered clear of that. Instead, the team ventured into other spaces: live classes and AI-powered homework assistance ‚Äì two areas it now wants to ‚Äúdominate and own.‚Äù
However, the country‚Äôs edtech incumbents have challenged the company‚Äôs ambition, particularly in the live classes space. Both Ruangguru and Zenius have rolled out live-class features over the past year. So has fellow newcomer Pahamify.
Despite the increasing competition, Saboo believes his company‚Äôs focus will hold it in good stead.
‚ÄúYou build specialization in one thing. If you want to specialize in recorded content, you will be needing a very different skill set, hires, approach, pricing points, marketing than live classes ‚Äì all of that will be completely different. You can‚Äôt try to do both. You have to pick which one you want,‚Äù he says.
Laser-sharp focus
With the social distancing measures put in place all over the world, edtech has been enjoying unprecedented popularity, and a lot of players have tried to capitalize on this by diversifying their offerings to capture a wider user base and cross-sell to existing customers.
CoLearn has resisted such temptations.
‚ÄúWhat we started in March 2020 and what we do now, it‚Äôs exactly the same,‚Äù says Saboo. ‚ÄúWe want speed, but to get speed, we need focus.‚Äù
The firm‚Äôs existing backers ‚Äì including Sequoia, which selected CoLearn to join its Surge accelerator program in 2020 ‚Äì support this unique approach. The strategy has also caught the eye of CoLearn‚Äôs new investors.
‚ÄúThe team‚Äôs laser-sharp focus in delivering the best live class experience is quickly gaining the confidence of the students and parents alike. Tanya, their AI-powered problem-solving platform that helps with homework, addresses a key problem and therefore has become an integral part of the lives of students in Indonesia,‚Äù says Amy Yeh, senior managing director at KTB Network, which is an early backer of Chinese edtech giant TAL Education.

Interestingly, CoLearn‚Äôs targeted approach goes beyond its products and features. It has also focused on offering only a handful of subjects, namely mathematics, physics, chemistry, and English, which Saboo describes as ‚Äúsubjects that matter for the future.‚Äù In terms of target segment, CoLearn zones in on grades five to 12, and unlike some peers, will not be expanding to the college and professional segment.
While the super app strategy has been much celebrated in the region, Saboo says he has strong reasons to believe that sticking to a certain expertise, particularly in the edtech space, can bring big success. One benchmark for CoLearn is China‚Äôs Yuanfudao, which became the world‚Äôs biggest edtech company in 2020 with a valuation of US$15.5 billion.
Yuanfudao‚Äôs app concentrates on live tutoring, though it has also rolled out sister apps that help students check math problems and those that have an online Q&amp;A service.
Moment to monetize
While it‚Äôs still early days for CoLearn, Saboo feels the company is moving in the right direction. At the moment, it boasts 4.5 million registered users, with an 80% class attendance rate and over 80% of students seeing an improvement in grades.
CoLearn, which currently makes money from its live classes, says 90% of its new users have come organically. Now, with considerable capital at its disposal, the company will look to reach not only more students but also their parents.
It plans to double down on its go-to-market and monetization efforts, which some say could be a challenge for edtech companies around the world.
Saboo acknowledges the hurdles ahead, but following a few go-to market experiments CoLearn has run, he believes his company is close to cracking the right monetization model and approach.

If you‚Äôre not a subscriber, get access by registering here.
Hello there,
Over a decade ago, I started my career as a copy editor in New Delhi, India. The job provided me with my first taste of financial independence, and it felt thrilling. However, I was not able to manage my money and ended up spending everything I earned.
This was when my roommate suggested that I make a monthly Excel sheet so I could keep tabs on my spending. It actually helped: I was able to cut down on the wasteful expenses and started saving a bit every month from my paltry salary.
Little did we know that the idea of documenting our expenses would one day emerge as an important segment of the fintech world.
Like India, Indonesia is churning out several startups that record and analyze consumer spending by tracking users‚Äô transactions at major banks and e-wallets.
Riding on the success of bookkeeping apps such as BukuKas and BukuWarung, personal finance management apps are drawing the attention of early-stage and angel investors.
In this week‚Äôs big story, my colleague Ardi explores whether personal ledgers can replicate the success of bookkeeping apps in Indonesia.
Almost half of Indonesia‚Äôs 270 million population have bank accounts, so the opportunity for money management players is big. But with bigger opportunities comes bigger competition.
Read on to find out what it will take for personal finance management apps to make the cut in this burgeoning market.
As for me, I‚Äôm still using my old-school Excel sheet to track my spending.

THE BIG STORYIndonesia‚Äôs personal finance apps see new tailwinds ‚Äì and VC funding

After the rise of BukuKas and BukuWarung, some startups are hoping to follow the same trajectory by putting a consumer spin on the two firms‚Äô B2B products.

THE HOT TAKECrypto‚Äôs wave of MAS disapproval

Image credit: Timmy Loen

Here‚Äôs what happened:

The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has imposed a ban on all advertising of crypto assets to the public in the city-state.
This ban covers both online and offline advertisements as well as ads through third parties like social media influencers.
Companies can only market on their websites, apps, and social platforms.

Here‚Äôs our take:
While MAS took pains to highlight that it ‚Äústrongly encourages the development of blockchain technology and innovative application of crypto tokens in value-adding use cases,‚Äù it also cited that its decision is based on how the ‚Äúthe trading of cryptocurrencies is highly risky and not suitable for the general public.‚Äù
This move is part of a global trend. On the same day that MAS made its announcement, Spain unveiled restrictions on advertising of crypto assets. Advertisers and crypto companies are required to inform the country‚Äôs fiscal watchdog about the content of upcoming major campaigns and provide warnings about the risks of these investments.
Singapore‚Äôs approach, however, is notably stricter than Spain‚Äôs.
As with other businesses, most crypto companies don‚Äôt set up shop in Singapore to access its domestic market. However, this decision may encourage a further shift away from the previous perception that the city-state was a friendly jurisdiction for crypto players.
On the flipside, crypto advertising does need to be controlled, given that many retail investors aren‚Äôt ready for the volatility of these digital assets. Also, the MAS directive doesn‚Äôt forbid crypto platforms from advertising on their own social media page ‚Äì a curious loophole.

What about the outlook for crypto in the rest of Southeast Asia? On the one hand, Singapore is often at the vanguard of regulatory trends in the region. Governments in some countries may decide to follow MAS and implement similar bans. This would have a significant impact in a country like Indonesia, where the retail market is far larger and the advertising of crypto assets has been rampant.
On the other hand, some governments may spy an opportunity to overtake Singapore in a fast-growing area of finance. No doubt, MAS had this in mind when it reiterated the city-state‚Äôs continued support for innovation in the industry.
The restrictions on advertising apply to a ‚Äúdigital payment token.‚Äù This is a token that:

is expressed as a unit
is not denominated in any currency (or pegged to any currency)
is a medium of exchange accepted by the public as payment for goods or services
can be transferred, stored or traded electronically

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and stablecoins are unlikely to fall within the definition above. Arguably, the former is not expressed as a unit or a medium of exchange, while the latter are tied to currencies.
As with many other areas, Singapore is trying to walk a fine line and have the best of both worlds. How developments in this space play out will tell us how deft it is at doing so.

In a joint press release, the Bank of Thailand, Securities and Exchange Commission, and Ministry of Finance stressed the growing usage of digital assets among consumers and businesses.
This increased adoption, however, comes with financial and economic risks such as ‚Äúprice volatility, cybertheft, personal data leakage, or money laundering.‚Äù

The value of the deal is undisclosed, but the process is expected to be completed within the first quarter of this year. Both companies count East Ventures as an early investor.

In a statement, Sirclo said that the deal helps its plan to offer more comprehensive online and offline commerce solutions for its clients.
Warung Pintar will maintain its brand and identity ‚Äì including its iconic yellow warungs ‚Äì and operate independently as Sirclo‚Äôs new retail unit. Warung Pintar co-founder and CEO Agung Bezharie will lead the new division.
Sirclo founder Brian Marshal will continue his role as CEO of the combined entity. Meanwhile, COO Danang Cahyono and chief marketing officer Ferry Tenka will head the company‚Äôs new Enterprise Solutions and Entrepreneur Solutions units, respectively.
The ecommerce enabler told Tech in Asia that it is currently looking to raise funding.

After the acquisition, Sirclo will have more than 80 distribution partners ‚Äì which includes the company‚Äôs own fulfillment centers as well as logistics service Warung Pintar Distribution ‚Äì that serve over 150,000 brands and entrepreneurs, 500,000 warungs, 6,000 wholesalers, and more than 25 million end customers. The deal will also see the merger of almost 2,000 employees across both companies.
Before this transaction, Sirclo had made several merger and acquisition deals in recent years, such as with ecommerce firm Icube in 2020 and parenting platform Orami in 2021.

730190,2022-01-26T01:55:05,Indonesia‚Äôs personal finance apps see new tailwinds ‚Äì and VC funding,"When a few Indonesian founders began offering digital ledgers to MSME merchants in 2019, the move turned out to be a masterstroke.
Driven by the country‚Äôs rising mobile penetration rate, startups like BukuKas and BukuWarung, who offer bookkeeping apps to businesses, have collectively garnered over 10 million users and raised almost US$150 million in funding ‚Äì all in the space of just two years.
Now, a new group of founders is hoping to follow that trajectory with a similar product idea. However, they want to target a markedly different segment: the country‚Äôs banked and underbanked consumers.

As is the case with their MSME-focused cousins, these expense tracker apps ‚Äì or commonly referred to as personal finance management (PFM) platforms ‚Äì are free to download and use, which could open the door for massive adoption. But whether they can reach the scale of the likes of BukuKas and BukuWarung is open for debate.
One co-founder of an MSME-focused bookkeeping startup in Indonesia, however, believes it could happen.
‚ÄúThey can grow as big, or even bigger, because a lot of consumers are already online due to Covid-19,‚Äù says the person, who asked to remain anonymous.
He has so much confidence in the industry that the co-founder has even backed one player in the space.
And he is not the only one who is optimistic: PFM startups have gained the interest of plenty of angel and early-stage investors.
Jakarta-based Sribuu, for example, has received backing from Beenext, as well as from founders of Indonesian startups such as Ayoconnect, Fabelio, Kopi Kenangan, and Kudo. Another startup, Finku, raised funding from Global Founders Capital and 500 Startups last year. Both companies have also been accepted into Y Combinator this year.
Homegrown digital ledger firm Moni, meanwhile, secured funding from VC firm Init 6, and Pina, a personal finance app with an expense tracker feature (also inducted into Y Combinator), has received backing from 1982 Ventures, Prasetia Dwidharma, Oberyn Capital, and iSeed Asia.
Other similar companies on the VC radar include Moneyhub and Midas Financials.
Timely reemergence
PFM apps allow users to record and analyze their spending by tracking the transactions they‚Äôve made at major banks and e-wallets like GoPay and Ovo. This is done either manually or automatically (through system integrations).
Interestingly, the recent crop of PFM startups aren‚Äôt the first to enter the field, but their predecessors have not exactly done great.
Among the pioneers in this field was Jojonomic. The company entered the market as a personal bookkeeping app in 2014, raised seed funding from East Ventures a year later, but pivoted into HR solutions in 2016.

Another early mover was Finansialku. While the company is still operational and remains a household name in personal finance, it has not received any VC funding in almost a decade of business.
This not-so-remarkable history is something the new wave of PFM founders is well aware of. But they believe that timing and market readiness is key to overcoming past challenges.
‚ÄúWe see that this industry has come a long way since the early Jojonomic period,‚Äù says Moni co-founder and CEO Ahmad Faiz Nasshor.
Back then, he reasons, ecommerce transactions and e-wallet usage were nowhere near today‚Äôs levels, making it difficult to automatically track expenses. Additionally, there has also been a notable jump in financial literacy among Indonesians.
Finansialku itself confirms this shift. ‚ÄúThe market is very different to the one years ago. People are more educated about financial planning, and the financial industry has grown also. Demand [for bookkeeping tools] has grown a lot,‚Äù says the firm‚Äôs co-founder and CEO, Melvin Mumpuni.
Brazil and Korea are two markets that have shown how effective PFM platforms can be, according to Finku co-founder and co-CEO Shyam Kalairajah. Brazil‚Äôs GuiaBolso amassed around 6 million users before it was acquired by Latin American digital wallet PicPay last year. Meanwhile, South Korean mobile financial app Toss raised a US$410 million funding round last year, which valued the company at US$7.4 billion.
Crowded corner
With almost half of Indonesia‚Äôs 270 million population now having bank accounts, the opportunity for PFM players is huge. To add to that, more of the nation‚Äôs unbanked citizens now have access to e-wallets like GoPay and Ovo.
This makes consumer neobanks an enticing segment for many companies, says the co-founder of the MSME-focused startup quoted previously. The problem for PFM firms is that there are already existing players who have a head start.
‚ÄúFor the consumer side, you can even count the likes of Gojek, Grab, Tokopedia, Shopee who are all there already. It would not take them much effort to launch a PFM feature,‚Äù he adds, though he also contends that it may be difficult for ‚Äúbig companies‚Äù to execute well.
Other startups that appear to be entering the PFM space from an adjacent vertical are peer-to-peer transfer companies Flip and Oy.
But a bigger group seems to be the wave of digital banks coming into the market, says Hans de Back, a managing partner at fintech-focused VC firm Finch Capital.
Indeed, a host of digital banks in Indonesia, many of which are backed by some of the country‚Äôs top tech companies, have expense tracker tools as a built-in feature. GoTo-backed Bank Jago, for example, claims its bookkeeping feature is ‚Äúsupported by machine learning capabilities that are constantly being developed.‚Äù

However, digital banks typically only track transactions flowing through accounts within their own bank, which makes it perhaps less ideal for people that store money in several bank accounts and e-wallets.
This is something PFM players boast as their key advantage. In fact, connectivity and integration with various providers is an area of competition for these firms.
Finku claims that it currently is ‚Äúby a long way‚Äù the player with the most integrations. The company says it offers 23 integrations, which they describe as ‚Äúproprietary connections.‚Äù
However, one concern surrounding this is security. At the moment, all the players in the market are registered with the country‚Äôs communications and information technology ministry, but only Finansialku is registered with the Otoritas Jasa Keuangan (OJK), Indonesia‚Äôs financial services authority.
Meanwhile, carrying out API integrations with banks would typically also require a license from the country‚Äôs central bank.
There is a way to navigate around the license requirement, one industry insider tells Tech in Asia, and that‚Äôs by using a less costly process called screen scraping. This enables third parties to log in to a bank customer‚Äôs internet banking profile and copy transactional information to support their service (though there have been concerns about the security of this).
Mulling monetization
Winners in this space will be those that offer best-in-class connectivity and usability, says Finch Capital‚Äôs de Back. Those that succeed could reach the heights of heavily funded MSME-focused bookkeeping startups. However, de Back expects these PFM platforms will face the same challenge: making money.
‚ÄúIf PFM players could grow their user base very fast and have high retention, they might be able to raise subsequent rounds, but at the end of the day, you need a clear business model with good unit economics,‚Äù he says.
With the exception of Finansialku, which charges a 35,000 rupiah (US$2.43) per month subscription fee for its products, all of the local PFM players currently offer their tool free of charge. Some even promise to keep it free forever.

Moni‚Äôs Nasshor concedes that monetization is the main challenge in the industry, but he says the firm has started exploring ways to monetize. One of these monetization methods is creating a premium product with exclusive features, such as display customization and shared access for families.
‚ÄúHowever, relying on premium features will not be enough. Therefore, players in this industry need to be observant in spotting the [monetization] opportunities that can be offered that can provide additional value to users,‚Äù says Nasshor.
Likewise, Finku‚Äôs Kalairajah says that the company has already added functionalities such as its insights feature, where users see financial products that are tailored for them. The company, which currently has 200,000 users, looks to add more features and monetize them in the future.
However, if the likes of BukuKas and BukuWarung are anything to go by, players may not need to be in a rush to start monetizing.
Both companies only started monetizing their services in their third year of operations, after raising well over US$50 million worth of funding. Having focused their efforts on growing their merchant base, the two companies are now looking to reap the rewards by earning through newly introduced financial services such as lending, savings, and insurance for MSMEs.

Personal finance management apps have the potential to enjoy the same trajectory, but only if they laser in on equally painful and similarly enormous consumer use cases, says Justin Hall, a partner at Golden Gate Ventures which is a backer of BukuWarung.
It‚Äôs clear that there will be a lot of competition in this space, and inevitably, some players will lose out.
‚ÄúThe barriers to entry might be lower for PFM companies, and the winners will be those companies that expand and own their own financial flywheel,‚Äù says Hall.",Ardi Wirdana,Putra Muskita and Jaclyn Tiu,0,"['Fintech', 'Premium Content']",True,True,7

If successful, it will be the company‚Äôs second institutional round of funding ‚Äì the first being its over US$5.5 million series B round in January 2021. Six months later, it raised a seven-digit US dollar sum from Kuroneko Innovation Fund as part of the same round.
In 2009, Joe Koo and Tommy Yong initially launched¬†as a warehousing business modeled after Fulfillment by Amazon. However, there was a lack of volume in the Malaysian ecommerce market, which drove them to switch to last-mile delivery. But in 2013, as demand for ecommerce grew, they returned to their original business model that focused on warehousing.
Today, iStore iSend has developed a system to automate ecommerce operations. It provides clients with services ranging from storage to delivery arrangements and also value-added options such as real-time inventory management and shipment tracking.
It has also expanded into offering ecommerce enablement services such as online store set-up, brand onboarding on marketplaces, official online store management, growth and marketing campaigns management, listing, and customer services for brands and retailers.
The company has been talking to existing as well as new investors for its series C round and has received strong interest from new investors amid strong demand for ecommerce logistics.
IStore iSend will use the fresh funds to boost its operations in Thailand, which it entered in the second half of 2021, and launch in Vietnam and the Philippines by the end of the year. Following the expansion, it will be present in six Southeast Asian countries, the others being Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia.
Joe Khoo, co-founder and CEO of iStore iSend, told Tech in Asia that he estimated it would take US$1 million for a logistics firm to get started in a Southeast Asian country, and the firm plans to invest exactly that amount in each of Vietnam and the Philippines to get things running.
The company is also looking to make a substantial investment in the Thai market, as it looks to penetrate deeper into the market.
‚ÄúIn Thailand, we are going to invest more as it is a very promising market for us. If we just take a look at the initial numbers, it is quite a substantial growth area for us,‚Äù said Khoo.

India-based accelerator 9Unicorns is looking to set up a US$500 million fund in the latter half of 2022. It‚Äôs aimed at helping the young startups that are tackling the problems that the Indian market and the Indian diaspora currently face.


It starts with an idea: With this fund, 9Unicorns is mostly focused on idea-stage startups, but it‚Äôll also look for opportunities in late-stage companies as well.


Quintuple it: This US$500 million fund would be 5x larger than 9Unicorns‚Äô first fund, whose corpus stands at US$100 million. 9Unicorns is currently making investments from its initial fund and has firms such as Vedantu, Shiprocket, Melorra, Klub, GOQii, Chingari, and ReshaMandi in its portfolio.


Similar, but different: Besides providing funding, 9Unicorns also offers 90 hours of mentorship over three months and across 40 sessions to startups in its portfolio. It aims to write bigger checks for idea-stage startups than Y Combinator does and wants to create a platform to help startups with funds and mentorship, so that they can thrive and graduate with a proper go-to-market strategy.

Slime your way to success

It seems like a new blockchain game raises funds every other week. This time, it‚Äôs NFT (non-fungible token) game project Slime Royale, which has received strategic investment and incubation support from Vietnam-based entertainment firm Appota Group.


Slime Royale combines game mechanics and the decentralized financial model, allowing players to earn money through the game. Slime Royale involves raising creatures called slimes that are used for battling and entering tournaments.


The project will cap NFT tokens at a minimal quantity to protect the NFT economy and Slime owners from inflation. Slime Royale will release only 10,000 Purity Slimes, which are the first Slimes of the game, and these Purity Slimes will be used to create all of the other Slimes that will be used in the platform.


The investment from Appota Group will be used to establish Slime Royale with a long-term vision of bringing blockchain tech closer to everyone, as well as help it access Appota Group‚Äôs ecosystem of more than 50 million users.

729859,2022-01-25T05:00:16,Behind Ula‚Äôs entry into social commerce,"When Nipun Mehra arrived in Indonesia and saw how mom and pop stores (warungs) worked in the country, he was reminded of his time growing up in Delhi‚Äôs busy market area.
In both countries, merchants often operate out of their own homes and become anchors for social interactions in their neighborhoods.
That‚Äôs why, according to Mehra, who is the co-founder of Indonesia-based B2B marketplace Ula, it was a natural journey when the company launched its social commerce feature in June last year.
‚ÄúIn Indonesia, commerce has always been social. Yes, social can mean Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp, but social also means relationships,‚Äù he tells Tech in Asia.

Ula co-founders Nipun Mehra / Photo credit: Ula

Called Teman Ula, the new feature that means ‚ÄúUla‚Äôs friends‚Äù in English, is a service that allows small neighborhood retailers in the firm‚Äôs ecosystem to offer more products than what they usually provide to customers.
For example, a warung that only sells cigarettes can start to aggregate demand from its customers for oil, chicken, and other products. The order will be delivered to the warung¬†in the same way that the cigarettes are usually delivered.
In the last six months, Teman Ula‚Äôs registered users have grown 20x. Its number of transactions are now at around 70,000 orders per month.
‚ÄúOur target is to make Teman Ula‚Äôs contribution to our business reach 40% in the next 18 months,‚Äù Mehra says.
While that‚Äôs a very ambitious target, the co-founder believes it‚Äôs achievable ‚Äì the company saw 80% of Teman Ula‚Äôs users make a repeat transaction in the following month. Some of the users even made up to 14 orders in a single 30-day time period.
More offerings equal more income
Ula was founded in 2018 to improve how neighborhood stores run their businesses. The company made headlines when it raised a US$110 million series B round in November last year from prominent investors such as Tiger Global, Tencent, and Bezos Expeditions, the investment firm of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The firm‚Äôs first offering was a solution that aimed to help warung owners source goods. Then it complemented the service with a credit product that let merchants to buy products and pay for them later. Currently, Ula provides the service itself, but in the future, it may collaborate with other financial institutions.
However, the company saw another problem:¬†Warung¬†owners usually only focus on selling specific products to limit the need for storage space and to minimize waste. But this meant that merchants weren‚Äôt able to fulfill all of their customers‚Äô demands.
‚ÄúSometimes, people need to buy several items ‚Äì from toothpaste, shampoo, garlic, to chicken. And if the merchant doesn‚Äôt have some of those items, [customers] will go to another place,‚Äù Mehra says.

Teman Ula members / Photo credit: Ula

This is how he came up with the concept of Teman Ula. Previously,¬†warung owners could only sell dozens of products that they usually stock. With social commerce, they can now sell thousands of items, without the need to buy them in advance or provide more space to store them. In this way, merchants are able to increase their revenue without changing their outlets.
‚ÄúRetail in Indonesia will always be traditional retail. It‚Äôs not just about economics, but it‚Äôs also a culture,‚Äù Mehra explains. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why I believe that while the way they do business may be changed, but the basic culture will be the same.‚Äù
See also: Bezos-backed Ula‚Äôs winning combo may be commerce and credit
While the prime users of Teman Ula are the warung owners already in its system, the service can also be used by individuals who don‚Äôt have any space to build outlets or are just at the start of their entrepreneurial journey.
One example is Virgo. The former credit analyst, who only goes by one name, was laid off from his previous job and used his employment benefits to start a business. He used Teman Ula to get information on the products that he could offer to his neighborhood and started by selling several items, before continuing to sell more products as demand grew.
Teman Ula wasn‚Äôt the first channel he explored. Initially, the entrepreneur tried to find grocery suppliers by himself, but he was scammed when the so-called suppliers ran away with his money.
What happened to Virgo is not a unique case in Indonesia, as information on trusted distributors is still limited, especially in rural areas. Sumini, another Teman Ula user who also goes by one name, started her business by losing around US$7,000 of her money to a fake supplier.
Piggybacking on the existing supply chain
According to Mehra, Ula doesn‚Äôt need to build many things to get Teman Ula off the ground, as the social commerce feature is just an extension of the main business. Both operations even use the same warehouse, logistics, procurement, and technology infrastructures.
‚ÄúThe delivery guy who drops orders for Teman Ula is also the same guy who drops stuff for warungs in the wet market,‚Äù Mehra explains.
Because of that, he isn‚Äôt afraid of competition from other players, especially those who don‚Äôt start with a supply chain business like Ula.
For instance, the company‚Äôs current infrastructure allows it to deliver packages at the exact time when warung owners want them. On-time delivery, Mehra says, is a very important aspect of the business, as it helps keep end customers loyal to merchants.

Fadilah, one of Teman Ula users / Photo credit: Ula

The only difference between Teman Ula and Ula‚Äôs B2B commerce business is that the process for Teman Ula doesn‚Äôt end when merchants receive an order. That‚Äôs why while the social commerce feature is on the Ula app, it has additional functionalities like customer order tracking.
The difference between Teman Ula and traditional ecommerce transactions, on the other hand, is the necessity to meet a minimum order requirement before an order can be fulfilled. Mehra explains that this was necessary because Ula was set up to work for bulk deliveries.
This isn‚Äôt a big problem, he says, because the company often works with¬†warung¬†owners anyway. If the demand for an order is still below the minimum requirement of several hundred thousand rupiahs, sellers can add products that they can sell in their warungs.

Currently, Teman Ula is available in East Java, where the company started its operations and where its infrastructure is mature.
On top of that, East Java is a region with a high enough gross domestic product, with a less dense demographic. Thus, neighborhood warungs¬†are usually located quite far from the nearest distributor, making Ula‚Äôs service more beneficial for them.
However, the company aims to expand Teman Ula to Central Java and West Java in the near future.
Mehra predicts that commerce in Indonesia will become more on-demand, where customers can order what they want through channels that they prefer.
‚ÄúThere are startups who work on aggregating supply from farmers, and there are startups like Teman Ula that are aggregating demand from customers.

Another case focused on a member of the tech giant‚Äôs sports content unit profiting from a deal struck by Tencent with a company he controlled. Both of them have been fired.
The latest report comes as China‚Äôs crackdown on local tech giants such as Tencent and Alibaba continues to intensify. The country has also increasingly been tightening its grip on cases of corruption, which has led to the same tech firms to focus more on their own investigations.

‚ÄúSuddenly, there was a lot more interest among companies to look at HR technology to automate their activities,‚Äù Darwinbox co-founder Rohit Chennamaneni told Tech in Asia.

Chennamaneni said that the system can possibly notice employees‚Äô level of engagement based on multiple touchpoints such as interaction, compensation, and leaves taken, allowing stakeholders to make data-guided actions. Due to the vast amount of data being generated constantly, it is easy to find patterns to ‚Äúmake more predictive decisions, where you need to intervene at the right time,‚Äù he told Tech in Asia.

We break down the big and messy topics of Asia‚Äôs tech and startup community. Get the newsletter in your inbox everyday with a Premium subscription.
Hello reader,
People are often quick to question a startup that cashes out early, especially if ‚Äågrowth momentum is on its side. The underlying assumption is that fast-growing startups tend to be rewarded with lofty valuations.
While there is some merit to this argument, a peek beneath the surface will likely show that there is more to an exit than meets the eye. Supercharged growth doesn‚Äôt always guarantee massive profits, or even profitability.
Google‚Äôs acquisition of YouTube for US$1.7 billion in 2006 is an ideal example of a win-win situation through an early exit. It resulted in YouTube‚Äôs founders receiving a jaw-dropping payday and Google making the video-sharing platform an internet staple. YouTube raked in nearly US$20 billion in revenue for fiscal year 2020 alone, and that figure is only expected to grow.
Everything turned out rosy for all parties involved, but it could‚Äôve easily gone downhill had the deal fallen through. YouTube was less than two years old at the time and was burning through cash quickly. There is a strong argument that the second largest search engine would‚Äôve gone out of business without Google‚Äôs deep pockets.
Sometimes, the benefits that an exit through a merger offers are simply too great to turn down for a startup. Following this reasoning, we break down why AI-powered marketing platform Saleswhale opted for a successful exit through US-based unicorn 6Sense instead of going for its series B round.
Today we look at,

A leviathan lurking in the SaaS ocean

Saleswhale became the first Y Combinator-backed company in Singapore to be acquired after it agreed to a cash and stock deal with 6Sense. The acquisition follows the recent trend of consolidation in the global software-as-a-service (SaaS) market.
Interestingly, this deal is also the latest in the line of successful exits by Singapore-based SaaS companies. It comes after Stamped‚Äôs US$110 million acquisition by WeCommerce last year and Intuit‚Äôs US$80 million buyout of TradeGecko in 2020.


The time was ripe: Saleswhale co-founder Gabriel Lim didn‚Äôt disclose the exact value of the deal, but he told Tech in Asia that the amount is in the low to mid-eight figure range in US dollars. The deal comes after 6Sense secured US$200 million in a series E fundraise, pushing its valuation to US$5.5 billion.


Tough decisions: At the height of the pandemic in 2020, Saleswhale‚Äôs revenues plunged by 70% to US$300,000 as its clients across the world implemented cost cuts. The company also went through two rounds of layoffs from March to September 2020. Its workforce ‚Äì 38 employees across commercial, sales customer success, engineering, and design teams ‚Äì was slashed by half.


It was meant to be: Interestingly, Saleswhale and 6Sense had built a product map to include their own versions of each others‚Äô products in their portfolio, confirming the product-market fit for the deal. ‚ÄúSelling my business was like a protective parent watching my baby grow up and enter the real world,‚Äù noted Lim.

South Korea-based Greenlabs is inching closer toward achieving ‚Äåunicorn status after it raised US$140 million in a series C round at a valuation of nearly US$900 million. BRV Capital Management, Skylake Incuvest, and SK Square led the round.
Founded in 2017 by Scott Sungwoo Choi, Charlie Sanghoon Shin, and Luke Donghyun Ahn, Greenlabs aims to give farmers better control over their fresh produce and connect enterprise customers to reliable sourcing channels.


Confidence is high: Greenlabs has tapped into Korea‚Äôs digital agriculture market, and it is ‚Äúwell poised to become a unicorn‚Äù just five years after it was established, according to Shin. The company has raised a total of US$170 million to date.


Charting a course away from home: Greenlabs will use the fresh capital to expedite its global expansion plans, having already set up shop in China and Vietnam. It‚Äôs also looking to enter new markets through partnerships with local players.


Tap to track the harvest: One of the agritech startup‚Äôs services is Farm Morning, a smart system that gives farmers insights into their crop lifecycle. This system has an app that serves more than 500,000 farmers. Greenlabs also runs Sinsun Market, a B2B marketplace that specializes in fresh produce.

729755,2022-01-24T05:00:14,"Alibaba, Tencent‚Äôs SEA investment spree in 2021","
Amid intensifying regulatory headwinds in China, Alibaba and Tencent, the country‚Äôs two biggest tech giants, have accelerated their investments in key battlegrounds abroad.
Southeast Asia, in particular, gained significant attention from both firms in 2021. The two companies were early investors in the region‚Äôs ecommerce scene, but their presence is now felt across even more industries.

As the Alibaba-Tencent rivalry heats up in Southeast Asia, new alliances are being forged, and more industries in the region are set to be disrupted.
Tencent‚Äôs year-long shopping spree
In 2021, both Alibaba and Tencent expanded their footprint in Southeast Asia.
In mid-December last year, Alibaba laid bare its plans to grow Lazada‚Äôs gross merchandise value fivefold to US$100 billion by 2030.
But while the Chinese ecommerce titan focused on its existing investments, Tencent grew its regional portfolio instead.

Globally, the Chinese gaming giant racked up 34 investments in just the first half of 2021 ‚Äì 11x more than the same period two years ago.
In terms of industries, Tencent also appears to have a broader investment mandate than Alibaba. That‚Äôs unsurprising, given that Tencent has placed its bets on a wider range of industries in the past.

Tencent‚Äôs regional portfolio includes firms in industries like logistics and transportation, which are not integral to its core online entertainment business. This stands in stark contrast from its domestic strategy, which centers on investments in artificial intelligence and mobile app startups.
What the firm‚Äôs regional moves hint at is the growing importance of Southeast Asia in the global supply chain, particularly as a ‚Äúway station‚Äù between China and the US, says Orient Capital Research managing director Andrew Collier. Over the last decade, Collier has closely observed economic and financial trends in China.
The data on last year‚Äôs investments also suggests that Tencent is overlapping more with Alibaba. While our previous analysis found competing investments in only the fintech sector, Tencent entered into ecommerce with three investments in late 2021: Singapore-based collectibles e-tailer Mighty Jaxx, Philippine B2B platform Growsari, and Indonesian ecommerce marketplace Ula.
Tighter financial regulations could also limit room for growth in fintech, forcing Tencent and Alibaba to eventually compete in other industries.
‚ÄúFintech is a growing area, but it‚Äôs harder to get market share, as many governments would like to control domestic financial flows,‚Äù shares Collier.
Befriending investors
It‚Äôs too early to tell if Southeast Asia‚Äôs startups will have to take sides in the Alibaba-Tencent rivalry, but the immediate impact of the increasing investments from the two firms could be beneficial for the region‚Äôs startup ecosystem.

Between 2014 to 2021, both firms have either led investments or co-invested with regional and international investors across a total of 41 funding rounds worth US$20.6 billion.
While the two companies preferred late-stage and strategic investments prior to 2020, Tencent is increasingly looking at backing more fledgling firms.

Cumulatively, a little over 77% of all funding rounds that both companies participated in from 2014 to 2019 were late-stage or strategic investments. That figure falls to 58% after 2020.
Will the rush into Southeast Asia last?
But even as Alibaba and Tencent up their stakes in the region, other concerns could complicate their jostle for Southeast Asia.
For one, Beijing‚Äôs ongoing crackdown could encroach on the foreign holdings of local firms, swooping down on investments that are at risk of leaking data to foreign governments. Allegedly, the fear that this would happen caused TikTok parent ByteDance to withhold plans for a US IPO last year.

India‚Äôs decision to tighten its policy on foreign direct investment from any country it shares a land border ‚Äì which partly drove Chinese investments toward Southeast Asia ‚Äì may also be reversed soon.
According to Bloomberg, the proposal to loosen restrictions could be approved ‚Äúas early as next month.‚Äù
On the other hand, Southeast Asia‚Äôs relatively untapped potential could persuade Tencent and Alibaba to invest even more, especially after their divestments, which flushed their coffers with cash.
There would be sizable implications should the two Chinese firms strengthen their toehold in the area: Grab might have to worry about GoTo, which has Alibaba and Tencent as shareholders. And with a distracted Shopee fighting ecommerce wars on many fronts, Alibaba might exploit the opportunity by doubling down on Lazada.
Given how nascent Southeast Asia‚Äôs startup scene is, it seems there‚Äôs still room for a dramatic shake-up.

Hi readers,
My latest story on UangTeman sees the troubled online lender find a potential acquirer: a Singapore-based fintech company called IN Financial Technologies Holdings. Of course, the deal isn‚Äôt final yet, but could this solve UangTeman‚Äôs problems?
Its ex-employees, however, are not keen to stick around and find out. This isn‚Äôt the first time they‚Äôve heard of a potential acquisition, and they‚Äôve already requested an audience with Indonesia‚Äôs financial services authority. Meanwhile, UangTeman continues to push back its timeline for settling unpaid salaries, taxes, and social security.
Here‚Äôs the dilemma: The company needs employees to cooperate if it wants to close the acquisition, especially as it seeks to extend its lending license. On the other hand, it‚Äôs no surprise that by this point, employees are no longer patient and are unwilling to take extraordinary steps.
Where does UangTeman go from here? I suppose only time will tell.

Hello reader,
A couple of years ago, I wrote a piece about blockchain technology and how it had the potential to be the future of the gaming industry.
Back then, blockchain games had yet to hit the mainstream. Axie Infinity was still a fairly new player, and when you mentioned ‚Äúblockchain games,‚Äù what most people had in mind was Cryptokitties ‚Äì not exactly the best example to use to argue for such games.
The situation has changed tremendously since then. Even my dad‚Äôs 55-year-old friend is familiar with the name Axie Infinity, and more blockchain gaming firms have emerged and achieved some measure of success.
One of the leading players in the field is Hong Kong-based Animoca Brands. This week, it raised US$359 million in late-stage money, pushing its valuation up to US$5 billion.
The industry‚Äôs come a long way, and I‚Äôm excited just thinking about how much more it will evolve in another couple of years.

Hello reader,
Since I moved into my own home, I‚Äôve noticed that I don‚Äôt have as much time for leisure. When I was living with my parents, I‚Äôd have about three to four hours before bedtime to do whatever I wanted once I was done with my evening exercise and dinner.

At any rate, I‚Äôm certainly way more active now with all the newfound everyday responsibilities ‚Äì even if not entirely by choice.

Singapore telco firm Singtel and Southeast Asian super app Grab have each acquired 2.4 billion new shares in Indonesian Bank Fama International for a total of 1 trillion rupiah (around US$70 million). After the deal, both companies would each have around a 16.26% stake in the bank.

Indonesian conglomerate Emtek Group acquired bank Fama International in a bid to enter the digital banking space in the country. After the share acquisition, its stake in the bank has been diluted from 93% to 62.76%.
Before this deal, Singtel had partnered with Grab to acquire a digital full bank license from the Monetary Authority of Singapore. The consortium then also applied for a digital bank license from Malaysia‚Äôs central bank in July last year.
The Indonesian digital banking space has become crowded after prominent tech companies, such as Gojek, Sea Group, Akulaku, Bukalapak, Line, and Kredivo, acquired small banks to evolve them into digital offerings.

729208,2022-01-21T05:25:24,The impact of Tencent‚Äôs share divestments,"Tencent has an impressive venture portfolio that consists of companies like Tesla, Nio, Didi, GoTo, JD.com, Meituan, Sea, Pinduoduo, Snap, Reddit, Kuaishou, Bilibili, Futu, and more. However, Tencent‚Äôs actual value and the extent of its holdings aren‚Äôt clear because the company doesn‚Äôt disclose these details.
One thing for sure is that the company‚Äôs portfolio value has declined significantly due to the regulatory clampdowns in China.

Photo credit: Tencent

Over the last month, Tencent has made several surprise moves: It divested its stake in JD.com and pared down its stake in Sea Group. Following this trajectory, Tencent could be unwinding more investments in the future.
Here are some guesses what those might be.
Tencent‚Äôs decisions
In December, Tencent announced it was divesting shares in JD.com, which caused the Chinese ecommerce firm‚Äôs share price to tank. A few weeks ago, Tencent sold US$3 billion worth of shares in Southeast Asian internet giant Sea Group at US$208 each. As a result, Sea‚Äôs share price dropped 11.4% to US$197.84 at the time.
After the sale, Tencent‚Äôs stake in Sea dropped from 21.3% to 18.7%. Tencent will also be restricted from selling Sea shares over the next six months.
However, I believe the divestment will continue, adding more selling pressure to Sea shares.
This means that Tencent can potentially raise another US$20.5 billion if it eventually divests its entire Sea stock at the internet company‚Äôs present market capitalization.
With the current US$3 billion sale in Sea and US$16 billion sale in JD, Tencent is sitting on US$19 billion in cash. As of June 30, 2021, Tencent had US$38.8 billion in cash and deposits, so the two share sales are a significant cash injection for the company.
Future choices
Why is Tencent doing this? The company has invested in several startups and has built up an impressive venture portfolio. I think this is due to the ongoing regulatory pressure in China and because Tencent‚Äôs stakes in numerous successful enterprises in the country are seen as anti-competitive.
If my theory proves true, then Tencent will have to unwind more investments in the coming months. The next likely candidate would be Pinduoduo since it is also an ecommerce player like JD and Sea. Tencent has a 15.6% stake in Pinduoduo, so a complete divestment at a share price of US$49.82 apiece would raise US$9.8 billion for the Chinese tech titan.
After Pinduoduo, the next target would be Meituan, another major platform player in China. Tencent has a 17.2% stake in Meituan, which would be worth US$27.1 billion at the time of writing.
Once Tencent divests shares in its ecommerce bets, the next group would be the online streaming platforms.¬† Kuaishou would be the first on the chopping block: Tencent has a 17.8% stake in the video-sharing app worth about US$6.4 billion.
Next on the list would be Huya and Douyu, whose merger was blocked by the government in July 2021. Tencent owns 47.2% and 37.21% in Huya and Douyu, respectively. The combined value unlocked from a possible divestment would be just US$1 billion.
Of course, we shouldn‚Äôt forget about Bilibili, where Tencent has a 12.3% stake. That would raise another
US$1.8 billion.
There are even more investments that Tencent may be ‚Äúforced‚Äù to divest eventually, but I think these are the major ones that would prevent it landing in hot water for anti-monopolistic behavior.
Uncertain effects
The impact of Tencent‚Äôs divestments so far is a mixed bag. The positive thing is that the company is unlocking its massive venture portfolio and realizing the gains. By divesting its shares in all the firms mentioned above, we are looking at a total of US$86 billion in cash going into Tencent‚Äôs pocket. That‚Äôs 10% of its market cap today or 35% of its total assets.
Depending on how Tencent books these investments in the statements, there could be a substantial gain in its earnings and book value.
The negative side is that it‚Äôs selling these investments at much lower prices than before the regulatory clampdown started. Tencent could have waited for a better time to realize these gains. More importantly, it would lose influence in the ‚Äúconsortium‚Äù of companies that it has built up over the years.
And what would it even do with the US$86 billion in cash if further investments would draw attention to more anti-monopolistic behavior?
I suppose a huge special dividend may be looming for Tencent shareholders, and that could give some respite from its current depressed share price.
Instead of growing organically, Tencent has been taking a venture approach, investing in companies that operate in specific business segments rather than competing against them with its own venture.
That‚Äôs why I believe this divestment exercise is counterintuitive to the firm‚Äôs key corporate strategy, and Tencent may lose its competitiveness in some segments should the selling continue.",Alvin Chow,Jaclyn Tiu and Eileen C. Ang,0,"['Community', 'Opinion']",True,False,4

VTAC entered the Singapore Exchange on January 20 at a high of US$5.25 apiece, an increase from its issue price of US$5. It ended the day at US$5.05, with the retail tranche of the listing being 36x subscribed.
Vertex Venture Holdings got the nod to list VTAC on the exchange late last year. The company said at the time that it looked to inject about US$22 million into the SPAC by purchasing its shares and investing US$7.4 million of ‚Äúat risk‚Äù capital through warrants.
With the IPO, Vertex Venture raised about S$200 million (over US$148 million) through the issue of 40 million units. The amount comes from investors such as Dymon Asia Multi-Strategy Investment Master Fund, Asdew Acquisitions, and Temasek subsidiaries. Vertex Venture is backed by Temasek.
Vertex Venture is one of the few investors in Southeast Asia that has backed several of the region‚Äôs unicorns. It was reported last year that the company was looking to raise at least US$400 million to invest in startups from Southeast Asia and India.

Its team has already begun initial discussions around setting up the global fund.
9Unicorns will raise funds from limited partners across the world and invest in global companies started by local or international founders to solve problems that the Indian market and the Indian diaspora¬†face, Apoorva Ranjan Sharma, the VC fund‚Äôs co-founder and managing director, told Tech in Asia. 
The platform will continue investing in idea-stage startups but will also look for opportunities in late-stage companies. For every idea-stage firm, 9Unicorns writes checks of between US$100,000 and US$150,000. For late-stage bets, it injects between US$300,000 and US$1.5 million per company.
It plans to use capital from the second fund to invest in nearly 15 to 20 startups per month. This fund will have a life cycle of 6 to 7 years. While it is sector-agnostic, the fund will focus specifically on investments in agritech and supply chain logistics this year.
A 5x larger fund
The US$500 million fund would be 5x larger than its first fund, whose corpus stands at US$100 million.
9Unicorns is currently making investments from its first fund. Of the fund‚Äôs US$100 million in capital, the accelerator has put nearly US$33 million into 90 startups so far. It plans to invest another US$33 million from the fund over the next six months and keep the rest for follow-on rounds, said Sharma.

727512,2022-01-21T02:00:27,How this company took its DevOps capabilities to the next level,"‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not my machines, it‚Äôs your code!‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not my code, it‚Äôs your machines!‚Äù
This was the argument between John Allspaw and Paul Hammond, two Flickr employees who gave a presentation on cooperation between development and operations at the O‚ÄôReilly Velocity Conference 12 years ago. These arguments encapsulated the divide between tech developers and infrastructure operations teams, which caused issues such as slow deployment times and difficulties in problem solving.
The need for companies to iron out these issues eventually gave rise to DevOps ‚Äì an approach to the delivery of IT services that tries to bridge the gap between software development and IT operations. With this, companies could smooth out internal workflows and improve efficiency with potentially staggering results: organizations proficient at DevOps can deploy new code up to 973x more frequently and recover from IT-related incidents up to 6570x faster.
One company that knows the importance of DevOps is Hyphen Group, a leading fintech company in Greater Southeast Asia. The firm initially tried beefing up its DevOps capabilities with the help of a central team to help maintain smooth business operations ‚Äì however, both the engineering and DevOps teams struggled to communicate effectively, which often led to bottlenecks that delayed delivery times.

Shannon Murphy, CTO of Hyphen Group / Photo credit: Splunk

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve always had a strong engineering culture and ability to code our own infrastructure, but it was more of an enterprise view where infrastructure and operations were separate from engineering,‚Äù explains Shannon Murphy, CTO at Hyphen Group.
And, as the company accelerated its growth last year by acquiring personal finance community platform Seedly and launching several new products, not having fully-integrated DevOps created some growing pains in maintaining the firm‚Äôs IT environment.
An overwhelming issue
As the company introduced more code and products, the additional infrastructure made its IT environment more complex. Eventually, it became harder for its developers and infrastructure operations teams to react quickly when problems arose. When major infrastructure outages occurred, it took the company several hours on average to diagnose and fix the problem.
While the company initially tried leveraging its existing engineering and DevOps teams to solve such issues, it ended up hurting these employees.
‚ÄúMy heads of engineering had to come in at two or three in the morning because they were the ones who knew how to dig through the [error] logs,‚Äù Murphy shares. Additionally, employees were stuck doing less meaningful work, focusing on solving these errors.

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre spending your time troubleshooting problems, then you‚Äôre not doing what you love to do,‚Äù he adds. ‚ÄúAs a result, you‚Äôre not delivering the value that you want to the business.‚Äù
Moreover, having DevOps as a centralized effort meant that its DevOps team became increasingly ‚Äúoverwhelmed‚Äù as new products and services were added.
‚ÄúIt got to the point where I was pretty sure I was going to lose many of them because it‚Äôs just mind-sapping work to sit there and dig through troubleshooting logs, especially when you don‚Äôt really know the application that well because you‚Äôre not part of the engineering team,‚Äù says Murphy.
Empowering its teams
To solve these issues, Hyphen Group had to shore up its DevOps capabilities.
It started with decentralizing its DevOps and giving its engineering teams the responsibility to manage it on their own while retaining platform services ‚Äì such as networking, security, computation, and IT service management ‚Äì as centralized functions.
‚Äú[It] moves DevOps to where it means the most: the team that creates the product,‚Äù says the chief technology officer. ‚ÄúIt creates a much better sense of ownership.‚Äù
As part of this change, the company also needed to give its engineering and infrastructure operations teams the right tools to succeed. This was when Murphy started to explore potential solutions and connected with Splunk, a data platform that provides observability tools for organizations and DevOps teams.
Murphy says he was sold on the platform‚Äôs capabilities centering around end-to-end observability ‚Äì a term in DevOps that refers to the ability to identify and classify oftentimes unexpected errors in complex environments, helping streamline the problem-solving process and allowing both developers and infrastructure operations teams to focus on adding value to the business such as updating existing software or coming up with new products.
Murphy highlights how having these observability capabilities came in handy for Hyphen Group‚Äôs customers, who experienced isolated errors ‚Äì such as specific web pages being down ‚Äì on certain content management platforms. In such cases, businesses might not even realize there were errors on their platform or website for several hours.

With Splunk‚Äôs Observability Cloud, which provides software solutions to empower observability, Hyphen Group could automatically identify, track, and analyze error reports from these content management platforms. Through this, the firm identified a clear pattern within these error reports and built an automatic script that would resolve similar problems in the future in just under three minutes.
Additionally, these tools helped Hyphen Group integrate error monitoring and observability into newly released software updates for existing products and services. This allowed the company to improve the stability of new releases from the get-go, and the firm was able to conduct its last 275 releases automatically, with none of the issues it had experienced before.
Similarly, this also allowed the company to improve the stability of new infrastructure and reduce the time needed to deploy it. For instance, Hyphen Group launched its new insurance platform in just 45 days ‚Äì a process that would have earlier taken it up to a year to complete. Hyphen Group is now looking to capitalize on these improved deployment capabilities to facilitate the more efficient release of new products and services in the future.
Clearing the path to success
Moving forward, the company is looking to improve its DevOps processes even further through widespread automation, allowing it to achieve better stability, scalability, and security.
For this, it will need even greater DevOps observability into the inner workings of its applications, which the firm is working on by modifying its applications to accommodate Splunk‚Äôs Observability Cloud even better. In the future, Murphy expects these efforts to pave the way for Hyphen Group‚Äôs continual growth.
‚ÄúWhere I‚Äôm hoping to go with this is understanding system events, business events, and deployment operations in one consistent way, with Splunk providing the infrastructure and application side of that,‚Äù he adds. ‚ÄúThat is going to be quite awesome and a differentiator for us.‚Äù

Splunk Observability Cloud is the only full-stack, analytics-powered and OpenTelemetry-native platform which provides a seamlessly integrated user experience, context and workflow across metrics, traces and logs to solve problems in seconds.

729795,2022-01-21T00:30:13,Why Saleswhale sold its business to this SoftBank-backed unicorn,"‚ÄúI believe in the saying, ‚ÄòNever say never.‚Äô But this is definitely not something I‚Äôd planned for,‚Äù said Gabriel Lim, co-founder of AI-powered marketing platform Saleswhale, before handing over his firm to US-based unicorn 6Sense.
However, whatever doubts Lim had about selling his company were eased after doing due diligence and evaluating the synergies with 6Sense. The deal adds to the ongoing consolidation in the global software-as-a-service (SaaS) space.
Founded in 2015, Singapore-based Saleswhale uses its proprietary AI to write personalized emails, engage in conversations with consumers, and detect when a buyer indicates interest in a product. It serves over 145 teams from mid-market and Fortune 500 companies such as InVision, Sage, LaunchDarkly, Randstad, and Cisco.

Meanwhile, 6Sense helps B2B firms uncover anonymous buying behavior, prioritizes accounts for sales and marketing, and helps firms engage resistant buying teams ‚Äì or companies that don‚Äôt easily get convinced on the sales of a product ‚Äì with personalized and multichannel campaigns.
Lim didn‚Äôt disclose the exact value of the cash and stock deal, but he told Tech in Asia that the amount is in the low to mid-eight figure range in US dollars.
The deal comes after 6Sense secured US$200 million in a series E fundraise, pushing its valuation to US$5.5 billion. Blue Owl and MSD Partners led the round, which also saw participation from SoftBank Vision Fund 2, Insight Partners, Tiger Global, B Capital Group, and Franklin Templeton.
Under the deal, Saleswhale will operate as an independent entity, while Lim will join 6Sense as a product leader. The acquisition will help Saleswhale accelerate product development and focus on the last-mile execution of its sales and marketing product.
Saleswhale is the first Y Combinator-backed company in Singapore that has been acquired. However, the AI startup faced several roadblocks on its path to acquisition.
A tough sell
The proposal for the acquisition came at a time when Saleswhale was considering seeking funds for its series B round, which was intended to push the company‚Äôs growth momentum.

A screenshot of the Saleswhale platform / Photo credit: Saleswhale

But at the height of the pandemic in 2020, Saleswhale‚Äôs revenues plunged by 70% to US$300,000 as its clients across the world implemented cost cuts.
The company also made reductions to the software it used. It also went through two rounds of layoffs from March to September 2020. Its workforce ‚Äì 38 employees across commercial, sales customer success, engineering, and design teams ‚Äì was slashed by half.
‚Äú2020 was incredibly hard for us, and we were forced to rationalize our cost base,‚Äù said Lim.
These measures helped Saleswhale bring down the costs it incurred in 2020 by about 50%. The company, however, did not disclose the amount in cost savings from the layoffs.
Saleswhale also drafted a roadmap to increase its revenue and turn its fortune around.
The comeback kid
While it lost a chunk of customers amid the pandemic, Saleswhale noted that clients from the B2B segment were still paying for its product.

As such, the AI firm set aside resources to build a streamlined product that could serve these industries more efficiently.
Saleswhale doubled down on its core product to help clients with the different use cases and offer increased value, which could potentially make them repeat consumers. It also introduced additional features to its product.

‚ÄúWe taught ourselves to increase the focus on our product and serve our set of customers effectively,‚Äù Lim added. Notably, Saleswhale onboarded some of its biggest clients after the onset of the pandemic due to product specialization.
The acquisition push
As its product gained traction in the global market, Saleswhale was approached by 6Sense to discuss an acquisition that could drastically increase its user base and give the combined product a competitive edge compared to existing players.

‚ÄúCustomer conversations are a critical part of our due diligence process, and the feedback from 6sense customers is among the best we‚Äôve heard,‚Äù said D1 Capital Partners‚Äô Dan Sundheim in an earlier statement. The executive is the founder of the investment firm, which led 6Sense‚Äôs series D round. ‚ÄúImproving revenue results is a goal for every business, but it‚Äôs easier said than done,‚Äù he added.
Interestingly, Saleswhale and 6Sense had built a product map to include their own versions of each others‚Äô products in their portfolio, confirming the product-market fit for the deal.
‚ÄúSelling my business was like a protective parent watching my baby grow up and enter the real world,‚Äù noted Lim.
Saleswhale said that after the acquisition, it will ‚Äúaggressively‚Äù ramp up hiring for engineers, product designers, and product managers in Singapore and India. The company is looking to double its headcount by the end of this year.
Placing Singapore on the global SaaS map
Singapore, which is widely considered a world-class innovation hub, is seeing a number of successful exits by local SaaS companies. Some of them include Stamped‚Äôs US$110 million acquisition by WeCommerce last year and US-based software giant Intuit‚Äôs reportedly US$80 million buyout of TradeGecko in 2020.
The city-state‚Äôs attractive tax regime is also a factor, as founders who sell their companies get to keep a bigger chunk of the proceeds.

Global-focused software firms in Singapore benefit from having a lower cost-base and higher margins. They can also rely on top-quality software and engineering talent¬† in the city-state and from other hubs like Vietnam and India.
Most software firms target the US because of its sizable and mature population of customers that speak the same language and are willing to adopt new cloud software. But Singapore is emerging as a key contributor to the global SaaS ecosystem.
‚ÄúI think we have to believe Singapore is capable of building global SaaS products that can attract the attention of large companies in Silicon Valley as customers and as potential acquirers,‚Äù Lim said.",Deepti Sri,Collin Furtado and Eileen C.

Making hiring automatic

The process of hiring can be frustrating for everyone involved, whether you‚Äôre looking to hire or aiming to get hired. That‚Äôs where HR tech firm Kula wants to make a difference ‚Äì the firm has emerged from stealth mode and has just raised US$2.7 million in a pre-seed round from Venture Highway, Together Fund, and Global Founders Capital.


Meeting a need: According to co-founder and CEO Achuthanand Ravi, the inspiration for Kula came from his own struggles during his time at Stripe, where he served on the payment major‚Äôs global executive search team. At the time, he and his team had been on the lookout for a tool that could help them solve all the operational parts of the talent engagement process. After failing to find a product that could meet his needs, he decided to build one himself.


All in one place: Kula aims to be a streamlined and transparent recruitment automation platform for those that deal with a company‚Äôs recruitment process. The startup‚Äôs solution brings together all job seeker sources and automates recruitment. With the platform, recruiters can focus more on the candidates that are best suited for certain positions and send out automated follow-ups through several channels.


On the right track: The startup is planning for an alpha release of its platform in February this year. For the pilot program, it has also handpicked customers ‚Äì like Gojek and Wise ‚Äì across different business stages and geographies to better understand their specific needs.

729589,2022-01-20T07:00:16,Why Grab bought Jaya Grocer; how NFTs can be the future of O2O commerce,"Welcome to The Checkout! Delivered every Thursday via email and through the Tech in Asia website, this free newsletter breaks down the biggest stories and trends in ecommerce. If you‚Äôre not a subscriber, get access by registering here.
Hi there,
As a platinum Grab member, I must confess that the convenience of ride-hailing and food deliveries has gotten the better of me more times than I‚Äôd like to admit. But oddly enough, the super app‚Äôs GrabMart service just doesn‚Äôt sit right with me.
Efficiency is high on my hierarchy of virtues, but there‚Äôs just something soothing about strolling through aisle after aisle of freshly stocked produce.
Maybe that‚Äôs one reason why Grab recently acquired Malaysian supermarket chain Jaya Grocer. To demystify the deal, my colleague Emmanuel dug deep into Grab‚Äôs evolving business model and discussed how it might fare in an impending showdown of ecommerce giants.
This week, we‚Äôll also dive into how non-fungible tokens could revolutionize Southeast Asia‚Äôs online-to-offline commerce scene.

THE BIG STORYMaking sense of Grab‚Äôs Jaya Grocer acquisition

The deal marks a seismic shift in Grab‚Äôs ecommerce push, but its foray into the grocery space may not be smooth-sailing.

THE HOT TAKEWill the metaverse boost online-to-offline retail?

Image credit: Timmy Loen

Here‚Äôs what happened:

NFTs issued by brick-and-mortar businesses are selling fast and for record sums
For Southeast Asia, NFTs could be the missing piece in the O2O commerce puzzle
Amid regulatory uncertainty, experiments that pair NFTs with physical goods are still rare in the region

Here‚Äôs our take:
Nike made headlines in December when it acquired RTFKT, an NFT studio based in the US.
RTFKT collaborated with teenage artist Fewocious last year and sold 600 sneaker-NFT pairs in just six minutes.
Meanwhile, fashion powerhouse Balenciaga has taken things further via a metaverse tie-up with iconic battle royale game Fortnite. Under the partnership, Fortnite‚Äôs millions-strong player base can visit in-game Balenciaga stores. In the real world, the game‚Äôs fans can shop real Fortnite-Balenciaga products at a physical outlet of the luxury brand.
NFTs could kick O2O commerce up another notch. As the craze over these tokens hits fever pitch in Southeast Asia, retail companies in the region could ride this wave to metaverse riches (or it could be just a fad).
The good thing about NFTs is that they can be used to create unique digital experiences that drive real-world customer engagement. Case in point: Mighty Jaxx, a Singapore-based collectibles company, has launched exclusive physical-NFT pairs on marketplaces like OpenSea.
The company auctioned off a limited edition ‚ÄúDoge to the Moon: Boss Edition‚Äù physical collectible through an NFT launch in November. Mighty Jaxx also ran a 24-hour exclusive on its ‚ÄúThe beauty of rebellion‚Äù physical collectible seven months earlier. Unlike similar campaigns on ecommerce platforms like Shopee and Alibaba, NFTs confer not only a sense of ownership, but they also provide entry into an exclusive community.
For luxury brands, NFTs can serve as an immutable proof of authenticity. High-fashion houses like Burberry and Gucci, for example, are already banking on this capability.

But beyond exclusive physical goods, NFTs can also be instrumental in building O2O commerce ecosystems.
From a price-skimming point of view, NFTs let customers pay across a wider range of price levels. They are a step above because unlike non-crypto options, NFTs are ‚Äúeasily sliced and diced into a descending series of price tiers,‚Äù says Chris Dixon, general partner at VC firm A16z. That flexibility may be key in introducing NFT-physical product pairs for a range of goods in future.
Dixon also suggests that NFTs can reduce customer acquisition costs ‚Äúto zero‚Äù by ‚Äúmaking users [into] owners.‚Äù Instead of splurging on online advertising or a sales team, companies can mint NFTs and find new customers in the metaverse on a smaller budget. But NFT-minting fees can add up, and the cost benefits might not be fulfilled.
Even if customer acquisition costs are reduced, the community that NFTs are issued to could also pose another problem. Balenciaga‚Äôs partnership with Fortnite instantly put its merchandise in front of nearly 3 to 4 million daily players, but it‚Äôs questionable how well the move converts to actual sales.

But an NFT-driven O2O commerce strategy could really shine in generating revenue from two dimensions at the same time. Games like Fortnite and World of Warcraft have shown that there‚Äôs strong demand for accessories that let players express themselves via their in-game or online avatars. The same desire for self-expression can also be found in nearly every aspect of our everyday lives.
This is more than simply bundling NFTs with physical products. Companies can offer access to exclusive deals if customers own multiple NFTs or provide discounts on physical goods. Because NFTs are unique and price-flexible, the possibilities are endless.
However, there could be limits on how far NFTs could power O2O commerce in Southeast Asia. Countries like Thailand, for instance, have imposed a total ban on NFT trading.
Elsewhere, the laws governing NFTs are less clear.
Indonesia doesn‚Äôt regulate NFTs for now, but the country‚Äôs central bank prohibits the use of cryptocurrency in any payment transaction. It‚Äôs unclear how that might affect local NFT owners, given that majority of NFTs worldwide are minted on the Ethereum blockchain.
There‚Äôs also NFT fraud to contend with. Cases like the US$2.7 million Evolved Ape scam and the US$3.4 million Squid Game token scam could not only dampen consumer interest in NFTs but also encourage more stringent regulation of the space.
Ultimately, NFTs are still a regulatory gray zone. Can the risks outweigh the rewards? Possibly, if companies can prove the skeptics wrong by showing how NFTs can do what current options cannot. For the region‚Äôs O2O contenders, this could be the golden opportunity that they‚Äôve been waiting for.

Episode Transcript:
Nathaniel Fetalvero (VO):
Hello and welcome to Deep Dive, a show where we discuss the biggest headlines to hit the startup scene with the journalists who broke the stories.
My name‚Äôs Nat and today, we‚Äôre going to talk about the initial public offerings of one of the most prolific companies on this side of the world: Southeast Asian super app Grab.
And we‚Äôre going to switch things up a little bit this episode. Bringing you this story is my colleague, Tech in Asia journalist Deepti Sri.
[SFX: Grab employees cheering]
Deepti Sri (VO):
No, that‚Äôs not a rock concert. That‚Äôs a crowd of Grab employees cheering in anticipation for the company‚Äôs listing on the Nasdaq.
The Singapore-based ride-hailing juggernaut and regional super app went public last month after being valued at roughly US$40 billion when it merged with special purpose acquisition company Altimeter earlier last year. This makes Grab the largest Southeast Asian firm to list in the US.
Here‚Äôs Tech in Asia editor-in-chief Terence Lee, who was at the bell-ringing ceremony when Grab went public.
Terence Lee:
So it was, indeed, quite a ceremony. Like, I remember being there at the hotel and, obviously, not everyone could make it to the venue because Grab is such a large company. So they have parties all over the region, right? In various offices and even Singapore, I believe, for the staff that couldn‚Äôt make it there. It‚Äôs interesting that they also brought in, like, not just the office staff, right? Or the executives? But even, like, your delivery riders, your merchants, they were there as well, as part of the festivities.
And you can definitely sense the, I guess, happiness among the longtime staff, you can sense the excitement. And I think when they started the countdown, there‚Äôs this, like, tension in the air. Like, yeah, the atmosphere was quite electric, like, you can really sense it.
And once the whole ceremony was over, people were just really happy, streaming out, taking photos. People were relieved, they were happy. They were, you know, just hugging each other, just really glad that Grab has sort of achieved this milestone.
Deepti Sri (VO):
The hype that followed Grab‚Äôs listing sent its shares soaring over 19% at a price of US$13.15 apiece within minutes of the bell being rung. However, just as quickly as they climbed, the company‚Äôs share prices began to fall. When the market closed at 4:00 pm EST, they‚Äôd dipped more than 20% and were trading at US$8.75 per share.
While it may seem alarming, this is actually pretty natural for a Southeast Asian company‚Äôs listing in the US. Singapore-headquartered Sea Group had a similar experience when it went public in 2016. It only reached the US$100 dollar per stock share milestone in June 2020.
However, there are also a number of factors that have contributed to Grab‚Äôs fall in share prices. Here‚Äôs my colleague, Tech in Asia journalist Aditya Hadi Pratama, on the matter.
Aditya Hadi Pratama:
I think there are several other factors that supported or contributed to why Grab‚Äôs shares fall after the market debut. The first one, I think, is the Omicron variant of the Covid-19 that was spreading. I think because of the new variant, some researchers or some economic expert, I think, estimate the growth in Southeast Asian region will be lower. In September, I think, the Asian Development Bank dropped its 2021 growth forecast for Southeast Asia from 4.4% to 3.1%. So it would hurt the economy of Southeast Asia in general and also Grab‚Äôs business, which is primarily in Southeast Asia.
The other aspect is the doubt about tech stocks in other remote regions such as Southeast Asia for the institutional or retail investors in the United States because we‚Äôre aware that Southeast Asia is not a region that they‚Ä¶ they don‚Äôt hear news about Southeast Asia on a daily basis. It‚Äôs different with, maybe, companies that are based in the United States, so it‚Äôs understandable.
Deepti Sri (VO):
Despite that, according to a report from Aequitas Research, the company plans to release another 2.6 billion shares, worth roughly US$23 billion based on recent stock prices. These shares are expected to be released to the public by the middle of this year, and they could spell trouble for Grab‚Äôs shareholders.
Aditya Hadi Pratama:
The time is similar with the timing of when the lock up period for existing investors of Grab will be open. So maybe there is a possibility that the existing investors will start to sell some of their shares in the company, and some analysts think that that kind of condition, that kind of timeline, will keep pushing the price of Grab‚Äôs shares down.
Deepti Sri (VO):
We‚Äôll be right back.
[AD]
Deepti Sri (VO):
Despite a strong debut on the Nasdaq last month, Grab‚Äôs share prices have dipped ‚Äì and they could plummet further when the company releases more shares into the market this year.
But whether or not that happens hinges on the strength of the company‚Äôs financial performance in the coming months. While it‚Äôs hard to tell what those numbers would look like, it does help to look at Grab‚Äôs financials in the past year. So I spoke to Tech in Asia‚Äôs industry analyst Simon Huang to break things down.
Simon Huang:
The important thing to note about the share price is that it can change very quickly, and it‚Äôs a leading indicator. So investors can actually bid up the share price, even before the numbers improve, if they like what they see. But I think they are going to want to look at how things pan out this year as the region hopefully emerges from Covid and things normalize.
2021, if we look at the whole company, it saw revenues declining throughout the year. So in the fourth quarter of 2020, revenues were at US$219 million. And in 2021 Q3, which is the last quarter we have data for, currently, revenue had declined to US$157 million. And similarly, the EBITDA and net loss figures had also deteriorated over the same period.
Of course, Grab is a collection of businesses. And the two most important ones currently, in terms of having the biggest impact, are the deliveries and the mobility business. I think the idea was for mobility to be the unit that is able to generate cash and be profitable so that that can be used to support the other businesses. And if you look at the individual segments for this period that we‚Äôre looking at ‚Äì 2020 Q4 to 2021 Q3 ‚Äì the deliveries revenue has been quite stagnant while, for mobility, revenue has been declining. And that‚Äôs why you see the relatively anemic revenue numbers that we‚Äôve seen over the period and, you know, I think that that is something that may explain why the share price has underperformed.
Deepti Sri:
Got it. How long do you think it might take Grab for its financials or its operations to turn things around in terms of its share price?
Simon Huang:
To the extent that we are in a post-Covid, normalized world, I think investors will want to see how the numbers pan out for 2022 and how do mobility and delivery numbers play out over this year. And I think they will be able to get a better idea over the next few quarters. So if the numbers start to climb again, then it may well be that that‚Äôs what is needed to turn the share price performance around.
Deepti Sri (VO):
One other big question mark in Grab‚Äôs financials is its Vietnam business, which was the biggest drag on its earnings in Q3 last year. Vietnam has been a difficult market for the ride-hailing giant due to lawsuits and regulatory hurdles impeding its growth. And yet, the country holds a lot of opportunity for Grab, if only the company could capture it.
Simon Huang:
If you‚Äôre looking at a Southeast Asian play, which Grab is, Vietnam is important simply because of its size. It has the third biggest population in the region, behind Indonesia and the Philippines. So any company that wants to sell itself as a proxy for growth in the Southeast Asian technology, internet space, will want to show traction in Vietnam.
Deepti Sri (VO):
There‚Äôs also the question of Grab‚Äôs incentives strategy. According to the company‚Äôs financial data in the third quarter of 2021, a large majority of its services are fueled by these incentives, which take the form of additional fees for drivers and merchants, or discounts for customers. While this is a good short-term solution to drive growth, it might not be a crutch that Grab can lean on in the long term.
Simon Huang:
I think it depends on the competitive tensions and also on how indulgent investors are willing to be. If they‚Äôre willing to put off profitability for a longer period, then these incentives can continue. And if it‚Äôs necessary to maintain or grow Grab‚Äôs dominance in the market, they are likely to continue as well.
And, of course, this is not something that is entirely within Grab‚Äôs control. It depends on what its competitors are doing. So this is a bit of a game between the different players and each player is basing its own decisions on what it thinkt the other players are doing as well. If in Indonesia, Gojek is offering incentives and continues to do so, then it‚Äôs going to be difficult for Grab to pull those back.
But at some point, in order to be sustainable, these incentives will have to drop away. One of the issues is that it is not certain how far away we are from that point. And that might be causing some investors some concern because they don‚Äôt know how long these incentives will be required and, were the incentives to stop, how that will impact Grab‚Äôs position in the market.
Deepti Sri:
And keeping in mind that Grab is operating in such a competitive market, are there any pointers that you‚Äôd like to talk about that Grab‚Äôs shareholders should be keeping in mind?
Simon Huang:
It is important to consider each business on its own merits. So keep a lookout for the profitability of mobility and keep a lookout for how quickly deliveries is able to grow. The wildcard is financial services. It‚Äôs a huge area, there‚Äôs a lot of potential in Southeast Asia because so much of the market currently is underserved or unserved. So Grab having the super app and having the user base is in a great position to be offering various financial products, loans, insurance, investment, to its users, and those should be higher margin.
The problem is that so many other companies are also trying to get into this space. So it‚Äôs going to be very competitive as well. But I do think that Grab has a unique proposition for financial services if they can execute well. That should be another area to look out for and another potential driver of the share price going forward.
Deepti Sri (VO):
Despite Grab‚Äôs rollercoaster ride of an IPO, it‚Äôs a historic moment for Southeast Asian companies. It‚Äôs still a story of celebration and the promise of things to come for a region that‚Äôs got so much potential. It lays out the IPO blueprint for every Southeast Asian startup, but also shines light on some of the pitfalls that come with going public.
Terence Lee:
I can see a case for an upside. In the short run, there‚Äôs going to be some short-term pricing pressure arising from existing shareholders unloading shares onto the market. But once that clears out, the share price might go up, right? So I think for the other companies, I think it might cause them to maybe take another look at their own share price and their own valuation, but they will also probably understand how investment bank analysts are appraising their valuations.
And therefore, yeah, it might not change much if GoTo and Traveloka find that their valuations are still sound, still reasonable. But we‚Äôll see.

729459,2022-01-20T02:07:22,Making sense of Grab‚Äôs Jaya Grocer acquisition,"When Grab went to market in 2012, its business model was a straightforward one: being an asset-light go-between.
It provided a platform to bridge consumers with services such as ride-hailing and food delivery, and it charged both sides of the supply-demand divide in bringing them together.

Jaya Grocer has more than 40 stores in Peninsular Malaysia / Photo credit: Jaya Grocer

Things changed after Grab listed on Nasdaq on December 3, raising US$4.5 billion in the process. Less than two weeks later, on December 13, it announced its maiden purchase after going public ‚Äì a physical asset by way of Malaysian grocery chain Jaya Grocer.
Industry insiders who spoke to Tech in Asia believe that the move from being asset-light to owning physical assets marked not only a shift in Grab‚Äôs business model, but also a coming-of-age for the ride-hailing giant, which went from a scrappy startup to a publicly listed multinational group.
The industry insiders added that the acquisition is a positive for Grab in growing its business vertical, but they also warned that the grocery space, together with quick commerce (q-commerce), is heating up.
Breaking down the deal
Grab didn‚Äôt disclose how much it‚Äôs going to pay to buy Jaya Grocer, which runs 40 stores across Peninsular Malaysia. However, Kuala Lumpur-based fund managers and investment bankers covering the consumer and retail sectors estimate that the deal costs anywhere between 1.5 billion and 1.8 billion ringgit (between US$358.6 million and US$430.3 million).
See also: Grab to buy Malaysian grocery major
Coincidentally, Grab‚Äôs purchase also came just 17 days after Jaya Grocer‚Äôs founders, the Teng family, bought back their entire stake in the grocery chain from AIGF Advisors, which surfaced as a shareholder in 2016 after investing 300 million ringgit (US$71.7 million) in Jaya Grocer.
The Teng family bought back AIGF‚Äôs 45% stake for about 411 million ringgit (US$98.2 million), according to business publication The Edge. This means that the family possibly got a sweet deal from buying back its stake and selling it to Grab.
Teng Yew Huat is Jaya Grocer‚Äôs major shareholder, owning 55% of the company.
A ‚Äòstrategic move‚Äô
Victor Chua, managing partner of Kuala Lumpur-based VC firm Vynn Capital, dubbed Grab‚Äôs acquisition as a ‚Äústrategic move‚Äù for two reasons.
‚ÄúFirstly, it is a move to further strengthen its value chain by moving down the supply chain to better optimize operations and profits,‚Äù Chua explains. ‚ÄúSecondly, to have a more holistic online-offline two-pronged model. Either of these reasons contribute toward Grab‚Äôs ambition to be a super app.‚Äù
Another potential benefit is that Grab users can access one merchant with a wide assortment of products ‚Äì Jaya Grocer ‚Äì for all their groceries, rather than visiting a minimart via the app only to find that certain products aren‚Äôt available. This makes Grab more competitive against Lazada and Shopee.
Jaya Grocer is a profitable concern. In its latest filing, the grocery chain posted a net profit of 68 million ringgit (US$16.3 million) on the back of 1.3 billion ringgit (US$320.3 million) in revenue for the financial year ended December 30, 2020.
The other boon for Grab is that Jaya Grocer doesn‚Äôt have to follow Malaysia‚Äôs ethnic-based preferential policies, at least for now.
Malaysia‚Äôs distributive trade services guidelines state that retailers operating stores less than 4,999 square meters in size no longer have to meet the 30% bumiputera equity requirement in distributive trade services. This requirement is an affirmative action policy that requires businesses to give up at least 30% of ownership in their company to the country‚Äôs largest ethnic group, the Malays.
An investment banker covering Southeast Asian markets argues that the acquisition provides Grab with a forgiving learning curve.
‚ÄúJaya Grocer has experience managing upstream logistics, especially in ensuring products are well-stocked and optimizing space and distribution,‚Äù said the investment banker.
‚ÄúThe grocery stores could also be turned into distribution hubs for delivery riders,‚Äù the investment banker added. ‚ÄúThis puts the company ahead of the q-commerce game because currently its rivals are just in the dark store space, which is basically a warehouse of popular items. They (competitors) may run out of items but Grab can leverage the relationship Jaya Grocer has with its suppliers.‚Äù
Intense competition
But can Grab catch up to its competitors? It was late to the dark store space in Malaysia, with the first mover being Foodpanda, which has set up its Pandamarts and an extensive network of partner retailers such as 7-Eleven around the country. Foodpanda rolled out its q-commerce operations in Malaysia, including grocery delivery, in 2019 ‚Äì well before the pandemic.
See also: Dark stores light up red-hot grocery delivery market
Afzan Lutfi, new verticals director at Foodpanda, tells Tech in Asia that the company runs more than 50 Pandamarts nationwide, including in Sabah and Sarawak. That alone puts Foodpanda in an advantageous position, as Jaya Grocer lacks a presence in East Malaysia.

Afzan also said the Foodpanda‚Äôs approach has been two-pronged: working with large hypermarket chains as well as hyperlocal favorites. Across West Malaysia, it has partnered with names such as Village Grocer, Mydin, Lotus‚Äôs (formerly Tesco Malaysia), Midas Mart, Mercearia Grocer, and Pasaraya LCY. In East Malaysia, it works with brands like Everrise, CKS Supermarket, and Servay.
Grab tried competing with Foodpanda by launching GrabMart. But in Malaysia, its instant delivery service is only open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., with next-day or scheduled deliveries from 7 a.m. to 11.30 p.m.
That still trails Foodpanda, which promises quicker deliveries across longer hours. In Malaysia, Pandamarts are open from 7 a.m. to 11.30 p.m., while some branches in Singapore are open 24 hours a day.
Afzan adds that Foodpanda can fulfill grocery deliveries in ‚Äúas quick as 20 to 25 minutes from order placement.‚Äù
To stay ahead, Foodpanda‚Äôs game plan is to share with its partners insights generated from the company‚Äôs data science team on ‚Äúearly indicators of where the market is moving,‚Äù he said.
‚ÄúA simple example of this is when we identified a spike in the purchase of contraceptive SKUs (stock-keeping units) and pregnancy test kits in the early stages of lockdown. We then shared these insights with our partners and worked with them to list and flesh out mother and baby categories, and pre-plan marketing efforts to feature these categories,‚Äù Afzan told Tech in Asia.
Foodpanda estimates that its delivery zones can cover over 70% of Malaysia‚Äôs population, with Afzan adding the company is ‚Äúcommitted to expanding‚Äù its coverage.
Market participants are also expecting Shopee, which has been aggressively expanding its deliveries vertical, to move into q-commerce soon. Since early last year, it has already been operating an online supermarket with next-day delivery for orders placed before noon. Its parent company, Sea Group, has deep pockets with cash and cash equivalents amounting to US$11 billion as of September 30, 2021.
Despite the competition, the Jaya Grocer acquisition ‚Äúremains Grab‚Äôs strategy, and it‚Äôs so far the only one with some certainty for the company. So it‚Äôs a reasonable bet,‚Äù said the investment banker.
He pointed to the ‚Äúuncertainty‚Äù around Grab‚Äôs bid to run a digital banking license in Malaysia. The country‚Äôs central bank, Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM), has said that only five firms will be awarded the license.
The bank received about 29 applications, representing conventional and Islamic financial institutions, with the winners to be announced during the first quarter of this year, BNM said in a statement last July.
‚ÄúTo be sure, it‚Äôs just that: there are too many competitors. And, while Grab has the technology and expertise to run a digital banking business, you can only award the license to five bidders, which makes choosing winners a tough one,‚Äù the investment banker added.
Grab is competing with government-linked companies, politically-controlled firms, telcos and banks, state governments, and privately-held conglomerates for the license.
Bullish on deliveries
Grab posted US$212 million in adjusted losses before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (or negative EBITDA) in the third quarter of 2021, widening from US$128 million in the same period the previous year.
See also: Grab‚Äôs financial health in 8 charts
But its deliveries segment for the same quarter grew 63% year-on-year, with a gross merchandise value (GMV) of US$2.3 billion, according to Grab.
GrabMart, it added, continued to show strong traction, with GMV growing around 380% year-on-year and 78% compared to the previous quarter.
Grab is doubling down on its deliveries segment by forming new partnerships across Southeast Asia. These include Indonesian convenience store chain Indomaret, Thai hypermarket brand Big C, Vietnamese wholesaler Mega Market, and Malaysian retailer Lotus‚Äôs.
According to tech venture platform Momentum Works, Malaysia‚Äôs food delivery GMV reached US$1.1 billion in 2020, with Grab and Foodpanda owning a market share of 52% and 48%, respectively.
Lockdown dependent?
However, not all are sold on the grocery hype. An industry figure pointed out that Grab may have raked in cash only because of pandemic-induced travel restrictions where many opted for home-cooked meals.
‚ÄúMy personal view is that many who worked from home opted to cook and not use the app too much for deliveries because it can get expensive,‚Äù said the industry figure.
A few signals are pointing to people leaving their homes for shopping trips again.
Google‚Äôs Covid-19 Community Mobility Report for Malaysia showed that trips made to supermarkets and pharmacies were up 21% nationwide on January 12 compared to the previous week.
A number of management staff from two major Malaysian supermarket chains also told Tech in Asia that they have been seeing a rise in foot traffic as well as physical transactions ever since the government lifted travel bans in October last year.
They estimate an increase of 50% to 70% in customers from December 2021, especially for stores around the Klang Valley and in certain states such as Penang and Johor.
Despite fears of the Covid-19 pandemic worsening due to the Omicron variant, Malaysian health minister Khairy Jamaluddin said his government wanted to avoid lockdowns and, instead, use a warning mechanism.
If this trend continues, Grab‚Äôs Jaya Grocer acquisition opens another possibility: a hedge against a slowing online groceries space. If more people shop for groceries and rely less on delivery services, including Grab‚Äôs super app, then Jaya Grocer can be relied on to bring in revenue from walk-in customers.
May not be easily replicable
Another challenge for Grab would be replicating the Jaya Grocer acquisition in other markets. Grab declined to say if the group will be making similar buys outside Malaysia.

Vynn Capital‚Äôs Chua notes that it may not be an easy strategy to replicate as it depends on successfully finding local grocery chains that could complement the business.
‚ÄúThe other alternative is for Grab to expand Jaya Grocer to other markets, relying on the experienced team at the grocer,‚Äù he added.
If Grab is able to make the Jaya Grocer deal work, then it isn‚Äôt farfetched to assume that it will be looking to expand regionally. But, above all else, Grab has to perform a balancing act between growing its business and pleasing shareholders.
‚ÄúIt also has to appease shareholders who will be demanding dividends, among others. I don‚Äôt envy them but I believe they are on the right path with the Jaya Grocer buy,‚Äù another Kuala Lumpur-based VC said.

The announcement comes after his legal tangle with Kotak Mahindra Bank, one of India‚Äôs largest private lenders. The bank said it had planned to take legal action against Grover and his wife, Madhuri, after the BharatPe co-founder allegedly hurled abuses to one of the bank‚Äôs employees.
The dispute began earlier this month after an audio clip was leaked, where Grover was allegedly threatening a Kotak employee for failing to get the couple shares in FSN E-Commerce Ventures, the parent company of cosmetics retailer Nykaa, after its listing in November 2021. The share allotment was worth over US$67 million.
However, the BharatPe co-founder denied the authenticity of the audio clip.
Grover had also worked with the Kotak group for over seven years as its chief financial officer, prior to his stint at Grofers (now BlinkIt). He started building BharatPe in 2018.
‚ÄúThe Board has accepted Ashneer‚Äôs decision which we agree is in the best interests of the company, our employees and investors, and the millions of merchants we support each day,‚Äù BharatPe said in a statement.

Meanwhile, there have been tweets doing the rounds that Tiger Global and Beenext have sought an emergency meeting with the company after the Kotak-related dispute came to light.
Recently, a report from The Economic Times said that Grover also had a spat with Harshjit Sethi, managing director of Sequoia Capital India, in August 2020. The report said that Grover reportedly used expletives during the conversation with the executive after Sequoia decided not to participate in BharatPe‚Äôs series B round. In July 2021, Sethi became the managing director of the venture team at Sequoia India.

Anyone looking to grow their capital needs to have knowledge of finance and investing. But the jargon and data-centric content often scare people off from picking up the basic financial know-how to build wealth securely.

Whether it‚Äôs a startup‚Äôs massive funding round, the disintegration of a conglomerate, legal tussles, pressure from activist investors, mammoth M&amp;As, or drastic stock market swings, the space has a lot that keeps its stakeholders deeply engaged.

Change for the better, right?

The Sequoia Fund offers an ‚Äúopen-ended liquid portfolio‚Äù in a selection of Sequoia-backed companies. Roelof Botha, a partner at the firm, claims this is the startup investment giant‚Äôs ‚Äúboldest innovation yet‚Äù. It allows limited partners (LPs) to participate in a company‚Äôs fundraise at any time, from inception to IPO and beyond.
It‚Äôs a seismic shift in the world of VCs, where the norm is to invest and ultimately return capital to LPs within a 10-year window. However, is this change revolutionary? Or are these funds better investment options than dividend-paying evergreen funds, which operate indefinitely?


One size doesn‚Äôt fit all: The Sequoia Fund model has so far only been applied in its businesses in the US and Europe. It‚Äôs not a strategy that‚Äôs used yet for the firm‚Äôs operations in India, China, and Southeast Asia. One explanation is that Asia‚Äôs startup scene simply isn‚Äôt ready for a perpetual funding model. ‚ÄúOur ecosystem is so young,‚Äù said a representative of a VC firm that invests in Southeast Asia.


A damning statement: Sequoia‚Äôs Botha pointed out how perpetual funding would remove the ‚Äúrigid‚Äù and ‚Äúartificial‚Äù 10-year funding horizon that has been used since the 1970s ‚Äì a model that Botha described as ‚Äúthe business equivalent of floppy disks.‚Äù But while it is new for venture funds, it is not a new concept overall.


Not everything is as it seems: The Southeast Asia-centric VC representative suggested that it was fund managers ‚Äì rather than startups ‚Äì who benefit more from employing an evergreen funding structure. ‚ÄúThis is just another way to get ‚Äòpermanent capital,‚Äô‚Äù the representative said. ‚ÄúEvergreen capital is like the holy grail for many fund managers. It‚Äôs a load off if you don‚Äôt have to keep raising 10-year funds.‚Äù

Rewards for (strategic) hoarding

Ecommerce roll-up firms are still relatively young, but have already made a splash. The industry first grabbed headlines when Thrasio became the fastest US company to reach unicorn status, achieving the milestone in just six months. Not long after, its India-based peer, Mensa Brands matched the feat and entered the coveted billion-dollar club in six months.
Now, interest in ecommerce roll-up companies has hit a fever pitch and Singapore-based Rainforest is doubling down as it looks to deploy over US$100 million to acquire digital retail brands in 2022.


More of the same, please!: Rainforest has bought 12 brands so far ‚Äì a number it plans to triple this year. The firm will continue to focus on categories such as maternity, baby, and home, where the target buyers are modern mothers. The company has hit US$30 million in annualized revenue within its first full year of operations.


A clear strategy: The rollup firm focuses on brand owners based in the Asia Pacific and selling internationally. Most Rainforest brands sell to consumers in North America and Europe. ‚ÄúWe expect that to continue, with a heavy focus on China, where there is a large pool of cross-border sellers,‚Äù JJ Chai, Rainforest‚Äôs co-founder and CEO, told Tech in Asia.


Going beyond Amazon: Launched in 2021 by Chai, who previously held executive positions at Airbnb and Carousell, and Jason Tan, the former CFO of Ovo and Fave, Rainforest acquires and scales Amazon marketplace sellers in Asia. This year, Rainforest‚Äôs acquisitions will not be limited to retailers selling on Amazon.

Hello there,
About five years ago, a friend told me he had gotten into Ethereum. Over a coffee, he geeked out about the cryptocurrency‚Äôs potential to power ‚Äúsmart contracts‚Äù ‚Äì in certificates of education, for example.
That was 2017 ‚Äì the ‚Äúearly‚Äù days of cryptomania, the year CryptoKitties was launched, a few months before the crypto winter of 2018, and when Dogecoin was still a joke. (Depending on which way you lean, it might still be.)

One wishes they got into Ethereum in 2017. (This is not investment advice.) / Photo credit: Coinbase

Five years on, the metaverse, NFTs, decentralization, and Web3 have become familiar to every man on the street, regardless of whether most people truly understand what these terms mean or believe in their potential.
Or should I say, every boy on the street ‚Äì since crypto investors are, in fact, getting younger.
Gen Z, which is made up of school children and teenagers, is getting onboard the crypto train. Perhaps they‚Äôre driven by Covid-induced boredom (√† la Gamestop), access to play-to-earn games, the desperation to make a quick buck, or their general openness to new tech and risk taking.
Not being old enough to invest themselves, some Gen Zs in Vietnam are borrowing money from their parents to put into cryptocurrency.
In fact, the country has more people who own digital coins than those with retail stock brokerage accounts. Nearly 6 million people ‚Äì or about 6% of Vietnam‚Äôs population ‚Äì own cryptocurrencies, placing the country among the top five in the world for crypto adoption.
What‚Äôs behind Vietnam‚Äôs crypto rush, and could rapid adoption propel the country‚Äôs transformation into the next global blockchain hub? My colleague, Huong, has the answers in this week‚Äôs Big Story.
Also, we analyze what United Overseas Bank‚Äôs (UOB) US$3.6 billion acquisition of Citigroup‚Äôs consumer banking business in four ASEAN markets means for the Singapore-based lender‚Äôs digital banking endeavor and regional ambitions. Read on to find out.
And what about my friend, you ask? I hope he‚Äôs still holding on to that Ethereum.

THE BIG STORYExplaining Vietnam‚Äôs crypto boom

While the country‚Äôs young investors are loving the short-term profits from¬†cryptocurrencies, startups hope the trend will power the rise of Web3.

THE HOT TAKESupercharging UOB‚Äôs ambitions in SEA

The UOB team at the launch of TMRW / Source: UOB

Here‚Äôs what happened:

Last Friday, Singapore‚Äôs UOB said it would be acquiring Citigroup‚Äôs consumer banking businesses in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam.
Citigroup‚Äôs consumer business consists of its unsecured and secured lending portfolios as well as its retail deposit and wealth management units.
Citigroup will retain control of its institutional banking businesses in these markets. The deal is expected to be completed between mid-2022 and early 2024.

Here‚Äôs our take:
The stakes are high in the race to become one of Southeast Asia‚Äôs leading digital banks ‚Äì and even higher in places like Indonesia and Vietnam, which have large unbanked and underbanked populations.
Analysts across the board have given the sale a thumbs up. Besides having a positive impact on UOB‚Äôs return on equity, earnings per share, and other performance metrics, the deal is widely seen to be strengthening UOB‚Äôs presence in the four regional markets. It will also fast-track the bank‚Äôs regional digital banking ambitions.
Since 2019, the bank has plowed US$148 million into developing TMRW (pronounced ‚Äòtomorrow‚Äô), its mobile-only digital bank in Indonesia and Thailand.
Then last September, UOB threw another S$500 million (US$371 million) into the effort. Part of that investment was used to combine its TMRW app, available in Indonesia and Thailand, with its Singapore mobile app in a bid to forge a new and improved version called UOB TMRW.
Its latest mobile interface is intuitive, to say the least, and offers investment products as well as insights into spending habits ‚Äì almost a norm these days.
The bank has said that it plans to introduce more digital-only wealth products, the use of chatbots, and to leverage data to inform customers of the types of financial solutions available to them .
If anything, it sends a message that UOB means business.

 
Despite launching in 2019, TMRW is far from a household name in both Indonesia and Thailand. As of September last year, it had just over 350,000 registered users, most of whom were from Indonesia, as we previously reported.
That‚Äôs why UOB‚Äôs acquisition of Citigroup‚Äôs assets is highly strategic: The move could supercharge UOB‚Äôs customer base in the four markets, almost instantly expanding its user base to 5.3 million from 2.9 million. Its Thailand business would see the biggest boost, growing to 2.4 million customers ‚Äì an addition of 1.1 million users.
While Citi‚Äôs retail customers don‚Äôt automatically become users of UOB‚Äôs digital app, it‚Äôs certainly possible to convert them through cross-selling.
That said, UOB is not the only bank swooping in on the blue-ocean market.
In Indonesia, the digital banking scene is heating up, with more tech firms and incumbent banks backing small lenders. The likes of WeLab and a joint Sea Group-BNI effort have joined the space in just the past month alone.
Gojek‚Äôs Bank Jago and Akulaku-backed Neo have exceeded TMRW in terms of active users and cumulative downloads, according to estimates, even though both were launched more recently.
In 2020, Indonesia‚Äôs Jenius brought on 1.4 million new customers, taking its total user count to over 3 million, according to consultancy firm Momentum Works. DBS‚Äô Digibank, meanwhile, added 200,000 new users in the same period to reach about 800,000 customers.


Granted, UOB is chasing high-quality customers ‚Äì also known as the ‚Äúemerging affluent,‚Äù who deposit relatively large sums of money ‚Äì as opposed to onboarding a large customer base through discounts. This might explain its smaller customer base and slower pace of growth.
The Citigroup deal directly plays to its strategy. The move potentially increases UOB‚Äôs mass affluent customers by 81% and emerging affluent customers by 1.7x, as per one analyst‚Äôs estimates. This would give UOB a ‚Äúcritical advantage‚Äù against its competitors.

729416,2022-01-19T07:00:11,AMA about Circles Life‚Äôs $5m ESOP buyback program,"Why you should attend
The announcement by Singapore telco Circles Life that it would buy back US$5 million worth of stock held by its employees created quite a stir in the tech startup community. The ESOP buyback program, a routine activity conducted by the firm, allows some employees to earn ‚Äúup to six figures in cash‚Äù from the liquidity exercise.
ESOPs (employee stock ownership plans) are a talent recruitment and retention strategy that startups employ. And as demand for talent increases, its use as an incentive has picked up pace alongside the growth of Southeast Asia‚Äôs startup ecosystem. Typically, after a three- to five-year vesting period, employees can exercise their stock options upon an event, such as an exit.
In Circles Life‚Äôs case, all full-time employees, regardless of rank or tenure, get two months‚Äô worth of stock options as part of their basic compensation at 12-month intervals.
Circles Life‚Äôs approach to ESOPs has renewed conversations on how ESOP schemes are structured in Southeast Asia and how founders should design and implement their own programs.
If you want to learn about the telco‚Äôs philosophy toward ESOPs and how these programs can be better structured and utilized in the region for talent recruitment and retention, join our Ask Me Anything session on January 25 with Rameez Ansar, co-founder of Circles Life.
We encourage participants to submit questions for Rameez ahead of the session here.

Ansar also co-founded and managed TechCube8, a technology, media, and telecoms-focused venture fund that received co-investment from the National Research Foundation of Singapore. Before TechCube8, Rameez was involved in portfolio management and investments at Temasek Holdings.

729011,2022-01-19T02:30:13,HR tech startup that automates hiring emerges from stealth mode,"The hiring process can be frustrating for job seekers and companies alike. Year after year, universities churn out hundreds of thousands of young talent, and a seemingly infinite amount of professionals strive to find better opportunities at other companies.
This process can also be lengthy, with a position taking an average of 36 days to fill. Recruiters carry this burden, with many of them going through hundreds of applications to look for the 10 or so candidates that are actually qualified.
‚ÄúWe understand the challenges of a recruiter through first-hand experience,‚Äù Achuthanand Ravi, co-founder and CEO at recruitment automation startup Kula, tells Tech in Asia.
The San Francisco-based company, which has emerged from stealth mode, has just raised US$2.7 million in a pre-seed round from Venture Highway, Together Fund, and Global Founders Capital to help employers hire more candidates.

Right tools for the job
According to Ravi, the idea behind Kula hit him during his time at Stripe, where he served on the payments major‚Äôs global executive search team.
The founder tells Tech in Asia that while on the hunt for leadership-level talent, he and his team were in constant search for a tool that could help them solve all the operational parts of the talent engagement process.
‚ÄúOur requirement wasn‚Äôt outlandish ‚Äì we just wanted a tool that can send cold emails, automate follow-ups, and keep the passive talent engaged. Marketing and sales teams have had tools like these for decades,‚Äù he adds.
After evaluating dozens of products and not finding software that suited his needs, Ravi knew he had to build one himself.

Now with Kula, Ravi looks to build a streamlined and transparent recruitment automation platform for those that deal with a company‚Äôs recruitment process. The startup‚Äôs solution brings together all job seeker sources and automates recruitment.
With the platform, recruiters can focus more on the candidates that are best suited for certain positions and send out automated follow-ups through several channels.
Kula is planning for an alpha release of its platform in February this year. For the pilot program, it has also handpicked customers across different business stages and geographies to better understand their specific needs, says Ravi.
‚ÄúFrom Southeast Asia, we have Gojek and Open Government Products SG, and Wise is also a part of our pilot program,‚Äù he adds. Companies like ShareChat and Meesho are also part of this lineup, according to Kula‚Äôs website.
Recruiting the heavyweights
Knowing the names behind Kula, it isn‚Äôt a surprise that the company has already roped in these major companies as initial clients.
Joining Ravi are his co-founders Suman Kumar Dey, a former tech lead at Freshworks and software engineer for Grab, and Sathappan Muthupalaniappan, who previously served as a software engineer manager for both Grab and ShopBack.
The three currently helm a founding team of eight people, which includes engineers, designers, marketers, and a recruiter in Ravi. The company aims to expand this number to at least 28 by the next six months, the CEO says.
By expanding its team, Kula looks to build a tech stack that can serve as an operating system for the recruitment needs of its pilot customers.
‚ÄúWe would then take the product to all customers and get as much usage and feedback from the recruitment fraternity,‚Äù he adds. ‚ÄúWe also want to grow the team steadily and be ready for the phase when we hit hypergrowth.‚Äù
To help with this, Ravi said that Kula would be open to raising additional capital. ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt decided on the fine prints yet, but there are some advanced conversations with some of our wishlist funds.‚Äù",Miguel Cordon,Collin Furtado and Jaclyn Tiu,0,"['Investments', 'News', 'Startups']",True,False,3
728811,2022-01-19T02:00:54,How you like that: Behind Tokopedia‚Äôs K-wave marketing campaigns,"Even if you‚Äôve been living under a rock, you‚Äôd be well aware of how hallyu, or the Korean wave, has taken the world by storm. Often referred to as the ‚ÄúK-wave,‚Äù the phenomenon is evident in how people all over the world are appreciating Korean culture, whether it‚Äôs through listening to K-pop music or enjoying Korean food.
Indonesia is no exception to this phenomenon. The country is home to a young, internet-savvy population that has the world at its fingertips, and these people have had the K-wave wash over them via social media, YouTube, and Netflix.
Because of this, it‚Äôs no surprise that Indonesian tech giant Tokopedia has used the K-wave in its marketing strategies, seeking to meet customers where they are and connecting with them in more meaningful ways.
The power of shoppertainment
According to Hilda Kitti, vice president of marketing at Tokopedia, the firm leveraged the power of the K-wave for its campaigns as the phenomenon felt like a natural extension of how it could reach out to more customers.
‚ÄúAs marketers, it‚Äôs very important to stay relevant to your target audience,‚Äù she explains. ‚ÄúAt Tokopedia, we saw that several segments of our customers ‚Äì like the younger age group, or female consumers ‚Äì were very into K-entertainment, especially K-pop, and we decided we ought to bring these elements into our marketing so that we can better engage with our consumers.‚Äù

Hilda Kitti, vice president of marketing at Tokopedia / Photo credit: Tokopedia

The firm brought on K-pop groups BTS and Blackpink as brand ambassadors in 2021, and it often features Korean artists on its monthly television show Waktu Indonesia Belanja (WIB). A ‚Äúshoppertainment‚Äù program, WIB airs on the 25th of every month and marks the start of a sales campaign that runs till the month ends.
WIB serves as a way for Tokopedia to get customers to learn more about its products and services. The program intersperses entertainment content with promotional segments detailing the latest deals happening on the Tokopedia app, such as flash sales, discounts, and cashback promotions.
The show features different elements, ranging from comedy skits by local stars to performances from Indonesian musicians. But Tokopedia also brings K-pop stars into the program ‚Äì BTS appeared on WIB in July 2020, becoming the first of many Korean groups to become a guest on the show.
By featuring K-pop artists and other celebrities on WIB, Tokopedia gets more eyeballs on its latest campaigns and promotions. People may tune in to catch their favorite stars, but they also learn about what Tokopedia has to offer.
‚ÄúWe use TV, Tokopedia Play ‚Äì our own streaming platform ‚Äì and YouTube as a mass medium,‚Äù says Kitti. ‚ÄúIt reaches many parts of Indonesia, and provides us with a way of educating people around the country about the benefits of ecommerce.‚Äù
Branding and brand loyalty
After over a year of having K-pop stars as guests on WIB, Tokopedia decided to run its WIB Indonesia K-pop Awards in November 2021. According to Kitti, it was a much grander version of WIB, featuring performances from 10 K-pop groups alongside numerous deals and promotions on the Tokopedia app.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been engaging with multiple K-pop fandoms over the last year or so, and we wanted to do something special to thank them for their support,‚Äù she shares.

Photo credit: Tokopedia

By bringing K-pop idols onto Tokopedia‚Äôs platform, the firm achieves several things. Aside from attracting customers through the deals available during the program, it also propels Tokopedia onto the international stage, allowing fans from outside Indonesia to learn more about the company when they tune in to watch their favorite stars perform.
‚ÄúWhile Tokopedia operates only in Indonesia, it shows people that Indonesia is home to businesses that can attract global stars to work with and collaborate with them,‚Äù explains Kitti. ‚ÄúIndonesian fans also feel proud that a local company is able to do something of this scale, which helps create brand loyalty.‚Äù
While coordinating and monitoring performances between South Korea and Indonesia has been challenging, especially in the face of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, Tokopedia‚Äôs efforts in using K-pop as part of its marketing strategy have paid off.
Though unable to disclose any specific numbers, Kitti reveals that WIB often marks the biggest sales period for Tokopedia every month.
‚ÄúIn terms of business performance ‚Äì traffic, number of orders, number of new customers coming on board, et cetera ‚Äì that period is when all these numbers peak,‚Äù she shares.
An incentive to try
Aside from being a means of getting Tokopedia‚Äôs name out there and creating brand loyalty, the firm also leverages the power of the K-wave in getting users to try out new offerings on the platform.
For example, when Tokopedia wanted to get more customers to order products available through TokoCabang, its fulfillment and warehousing service, it created a photocard campaign to incentivize K-pop fans to use the service.
K-pop photocards function similarly to trading cards, featuring exclusive images of the celebrities in question. Some cards are harder to acquire than others, being limited to particular events or brands.
Tokopedia created exclusive photocards of BTS for its campaign on TokoCabang, offering limited-time opportunities to acquire these cards as a gift when customers bought an item available through the fulfillment service.

‚ÄúIt creates a good experience for users,‚Äù explains Kitti. ‚ÄúIf a user is signing up and trying out TokoCabang for the first time, they‚Äôre able to get a product they need, they experience the benefits of being serviced by TokoCabang‚Äôs free, speedy, and quality delivery ‚Äì and, of course, they get a photocard of their favorite K-pop idol.‚Äù
From her perspective, a new user may try out TokoCabang because of the photocard, but after using the service and enjoying its benefits, they‚Äôre more likely to return and purchase other items.
Tokopedia has seen success with the strategy ‚Äì certain BTS photocards sold out within minutes from launch. However, the promotion created some unforeseen challenges for the firm.
‚ÄúYou do have fans who are unhappy about things selling out so quickly,‚Äù says Kitti. ‚ÄúBut we use it as an opportunity to learn, to improve the mechanics of how these campaigns work, so that we can come back with better mechanics.‚Äù
Riding the K-wave
On top of working with K-pop celebrities, Tokopedia is also exploring other facets of K-entertainment.
The firm recently launched Mantul House, a talk show available on Tokopedia Play. The show brings in actors from popular K-dramas to chat with a host, play games, and experience Indonesian culture, such as through sampling the country‚Äôs cuisine.
‚ÄúThe K-wave is here to stay, and we hope to keep finding new and unexpected ways to connect with fans and customers,‚Äù says Kitti. ‚ÄúWe plan on experimenting with different formats and seeing what new trends come up.‚Äù
Kitti‚Äôs hopes that through these efforts, Tokopedia will serve as a bridge between Indonesia and the rest of the world.
‚ÄúWe want to bring more Indonesian culture into the mix along with these K-entertainment stars. It‚Äôs not just about getting more customers on board, it‚Äôs also about bringing Indonesia to a larger audience,‚Äù she concludes.

Tokopedia is an Indonesian tech company with the country‚Äôs biggest marketplace. Its mission is to democratize commerce through technology.

729255,2022-01-19T02:00:32,[Workshop] What NFTs mean to startups in Southeast Asia,"Why you should attend
Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have gained worldwide attention, so much that you don‚Äôt need to be in the tech space to have heard about them. Aside from the common understanding that NFTs are digital assets that live on the blockchain, not many know exactly what they are, their use cases, or their influence on the startup ecosystem ‚Äì there‚Äôs just so much more to grasp when you delve into the world of NFTs.
If you‚Äôve been curious about NFTs and want to expand your insights about this phenomenon, then you‚Äôll want to catch this upcoming workshop.
On February 10, we‚Äôve invited David Shin, head of global adoption at Klaytn Foundation (the global public blockchain project by South Korean internet giant Kakao), to explain the nuts and bolts of NFTs in this power-packed session, which answers questions like:

729190,2022-01-19T01:55:23,Explaining Vietnam‚Äôs crypto boom,"Nam Nguyen joined the crypto craze in March 2021 and has invested about US$3,000. Being a newbie, he says, actually offered some advantages. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt read a lot. I was decisive because I didn‚Äôt know much and wasn‚Äôt afraid of anything.‚Äù
Nam ended up making enough money from crypto to rescue his restaurant in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, which was shut down for months due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

Restrictions in the country have since been lifted, and his business has been up and running. In turn, the restaurant generates money to sustain Nam‚Äôs crypto bets. The 25-year-old doesn‚Äôt mind that his crypto assets have lost about 46% in value lately.
‚ÄúUnlike the stock market, the crypto world is more convenient for me because it‚Äôs 24/7,‚Äù he tells Tech in Asia. ‚ÄúI often wake up late, and that means I‚Äôve already missed the stock market‚Äôs morning trading session.‚Äù
Considering that Vietnam is still primarily a cash-based society, crypto adoption is surprisingly high.
Nearly 6 million people ‚Äì or about 6% of the population ‚Äì own the digital asset, putting the country among the top five in the world, according to data from cryptocurrency payments firm TripleA. Vietnam and India also led research firm Chainalysis‚Äô global ranking of crypto adoption by individual investors.
Years ago, Vietnam‚Äôs young and tech-savvy population leapfrogged the desktop and went straight to mobile. Today, the same story is happening with cryptocurrency.
Despite not being recognized by the government, the virtual currency has already become a hot investment asset, especially among millennials and Gen Z.
The Covid-19 pandemic and Axie Infinity ‚Äì a play-to-earn game that has achieved global fame from its base in Ho Chi Minh City ‚Äì have contributed to the growing allure of crypto.
Forget about real estate and gold; suddenly, everyone is ‚Äúplaying‚Äù coins.

Grassroots adoption
Trung Nguyen joined the market in 2014 but luckily quit in 2018 before the crypto winter hit. He returned in 2020 and now likes to stay informed by reading and consulting different sources. ‚ÄúCurrently, my portfolio is: 40% crypto, 40% stocks and 20% savings,‚Äù he adds.
Born in 1996, Trung considers himself ‚Äúold‚Äù compared to today‚Äôs crypto traders. ‚ÄúGen Z knows more about the market than I do,‚Äù he says, adding that some even ‚Äúborrow money from their parents to play crypto.‚Äù
The pandemic has dampened other business channels, and that‚Äôs why people want to bet on crypto.
Similar to South Korea, where crypto is seen as ‚Äúa way out‚Äù for young people, many here also don‚Äôt see a path to financial freedom even if they have a stable job. ‚ÄúInstead of working so hard to get 20 million dong (US$870) a month, it‚Äôs possible that you can earn 10 million dong a day from crypto,‚Äù Trung estimates.
The number of online groups for like-minded crypto traders to meet and share tips in the Vietnamese language has exploded. Scams like the latest one involving NFT game CryptoBike are frequently reported, but it‚Äôs not enough to discourage some traders from aiming to get rich quickly from crypto.
Nicole Nguyen, who has witnessed how the local blockchain scene evolved over a decade, says she‚Äôs not surprised that crypto is gaining unprecedented traction in Vietnam.
She has noticed a strong sense of ‚Äúgroup culture‚Äù among local crypto adopters. This means that if someone senses an opportunity, they often advise friends or family members in the same network to join or buy a certain coin.
‚ÄúThe pandemic has dampened other business channels, and that‚Äôs why people want to bet on crypto, which is open and borderless,‚Äù says Nicole, who also co-founded NFT project Duelist King and is a consultant for Blockchain Founders Fund.
Since late April 2021, Vietnam has been reeling from another wave of Covid-19, which has infected more than 2 million and killed 35,975 people as of January 18. The economy grew only 2.58% in 2021, slowing down from 2.91% in 2020, when the virus was fairly well-contained.
Traditional ways to invest like real estate and gold have been hit by pandemic-induced lockdowns. But even before Covid-19 struck, they were generally inaccessible to most people in the middle-income class. Meanwhile, interest rates have been on a decline.

Besides crypto, retail investors have also been rushing to the stock market. Nearly 1.3 million new securities accounts were opened by November 2021, echoing trends elsewhere including India.

The growth in Vietnam is astonishing, given that the number of new retail stock brokerage accounts make up around a quarter of the total (4 million), which corresponds to only about 3% of the country‚Äôs population.
But for young serial entrepreneur Duc Trinh, the domestic stock market doesn‚Äôt have the flexibility of crypto as well as the appeal of NFTs, blockchain, and Web3 (or the decentralized web).
Trinh had established accessories maker Curnon Watch and eyewear specialist WeeHours as brands for young consumers. In late 2021, he co-founded Neko, an ‚Äúall-in-one‚Äù investment app that aims to ‚Äúdemocratize cryptocurrency investment.‚Äù Trinh estimates that crypto adoption in Vietnam is growing at a rate that is 7x faster than the stock market.
The next Axie Infinity in DeFi
The global success of Axie Infinity has put the spotlight on Vietnam‚Äôs gaming sector, which was under pressure to produce the next Flappy Bird, the once-addictive mobile casual game.
Sky Mavis, the three-year-old startup that‚Äôs behind Axie Infinity, has far surpassed that goal. Its valuation has shot up to US$3 billion, and at one point last year, the game had reportedly racked up nearly 2 million daily active users.
See also: Our¬†coverage on Axie Infinity
Following the Axie phenomenon, teams in Vietnam have been scrambling to ride the crypto-gaming wave, with new GameFi projects being introduced into the market almost on a weekly basis.
Jun Wakabayashi, an associate with VC firm and accelerator AppWorks, thinks it‚Äôs not a coincidence that GameFi has become ‚Äúa big thing‚Äù in Vietnam. ‚ÄúEven before this crypto hype, Vietnam has already been very strong on casual and semi-casual games. But it‚Äôs just the tip of the iceberg,‚Äù he observes.
AppWorks closed US$150 million for its Fund III last August, with blockchain identified as a core investment theme. The firm mainly focuses on Taiwan and Southeast Asia.
As GameFi drives people, especially those that are outside the traditional banking system, to learn and adopt crypto, Wakabayashi believes that the trend will inspire teams to build other financial products.


The wider tech community in Vietnam also shares that same sentiment, welcoming the increased adoption from more people in the ‚Äúmainstream.‚Äù
For Vinh The Nguyen, co-founder and CEO of Coin98, it makes sense that GameFi has become the hottest category. ‚ÄúIt might be easier for these projects to generate revenue or adopt new users. The concern is that resources could have been better used by other teams that want to build other stuff on blockchain,‚Äù he says.

Founded in 2017, Coin98 allows users to swap, borrow, lend, invest, and earn crypto. The team says it has over 1 million users in more than 150 countries, and about 25% of them come from Vietnam.
Coin98 was originally a blockchain and crypto research company, but it pivoted to building products in 2019 after surviving the 2018 crypto crash. It operates Coin98 Insights, a platform to spread blockchain and crypto knowledge in Vietnamese to newbies and advanced users alike.
The startup says it wants to support users who can approach crypto with critical thinking instead of just gunning for short-term profits. Vinh believes such educational efforts are crucial to widespread adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi), which refers to financial tools that remove the need for intermediaries such as banks or brokers.
Coin98‚Äôs vision is to build a super app for users to access the DeFi ecosystem, which its CEO describes as ‚Äúleveling up‚Äù what Binance, the crypto exchange major, has done. However, unlike Binance, Coin98 says it is ‚Äúdecentralized‚Äù: In simplest terms, this means that only users have control over their assets.

Photo credit: Coin98

Binance, in fact, recognizes Coin98‚Äôs efforts. Binance Labs, the global platform‚Äôs venture capital and incubator arm, recently announced a strategic investment in Coin98.
Prior to this, the startup had raised about US$16.5 million from investors, according to Crunchbase data.
For better or worse, ‚Äúcrypto is the first introduction to investing for many Vietnamese people and others in Southeast Asia,‚Äù says Peter Hoang, CEO and co-founder of crypto investment platform Finblox. ‚ÄúFor the first time, they have access to a global asset class and are able to invest with the rest of the world.‚Äù
Launched in November 2021, Finblox has already raised funding from prominent institutional investors like Sequoia Capital India and CoinFund. The Hong Kong-based platform wants users to hold on to their crypto assets and earn yields instead of trading them.
Finblox claims that it could offer up to 10% annual percentage yield on coins such as USDC and BTC as well as a much higher interest for Axie‚Äôs tokens. The startup does so by lending the crypto to financial institutions.
Hoang estimates that despite the current hype, only about 2% of Southeast Asia‚Äôs population has had exposure to crypto. Finblox hopes to bridge that gap.
‚ÄúI believe that crypto is the best on-ramp into the world of investing and gives access to the exciting alternative financial system,‚Äù he adds. On-ramp refers to a service that allows for the exchange of traditional or fiat money for cryptocurrencies.
Gray area
Vietnam doesn‚Äôt have a clear legal framework on cryptocurrencies, so the trading of such assets remains in a gray area. Technically, users can¬†rely on peer-to-peer exchanges like Binance to buy crypto assets from other individuals.
Early last year, Binance announced the launch of P2P trading services for Vietnamese dong (VND). Changpeng Zhao, Binance‚Äôs CEO and founder, was quoted as saying the country could be ‚Äúthe next global blockchain hub.‚Äù
In 2018, the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV), however, issued a statement¬†banning¬†all cryptocurrency-related transactions via the banking system. This means that users cannot use banks to buy or convert crypto assets.

Photo credit: Burdun / 123RF

In July 2021, Vietnam‚Äôs prime minister asked SBV to study cryptocurrencies and explore a pilot project. It‚Äôs unclear what this project entails, but the goal is to ‚Äúhelp the government find positive and negative aspects‚Äù of cryptocurrencies as it‚Äôs an ‚Äúinevitable trend.‚Äù
A local news report published last year suggested that the program could lead to a potential issuance of a virtual VND, but unlike the typical digital currencies, its value would still depend on the government‚Äôs decision.
While this is a promising sign, concrete policies on cryptocurrencies in Vietnam are probably not coming anytime soon. The industry is still waiting for a long-anticipated fintech sandbox.
At this early stage, most Southeast Asian governments are also not quite clear about how to regulate cryptocurrencies and other digital assets.
Indonesia permits the trading of cryptocurrency but doesn‚Äôt recognize it as a form of payment. The Philippines, where Axie Infinity first experienced its meteoric rise, allows the use of virtual currencies ‚Äúto buy virtual items‚Äù or even ‚Äúreal goods from online shops/merchants.‚Äù
The beauty of Web3 is that it‚Äôs the developers‚Äô world. If you have a technical background, the sky‚Äôs the limit right now.
Singapore has also cautioned people about making responsible decisions on digital investment vehicles such as NFTs and metaverse assets as the country looks to embrace cryptocurrencies in a measured way, Bloomberg reported. The city-state‚Äôs central bank also earlier this week¬†issued guidelines asking crypto trading companies to refrain from advertising their services to the public.
Meanwhile, even as they operate within the so-called gray zone, Vietnam‚Äôs crypto adopters are still in a ‚Äúhoneymoon phase,‚Äù says Nicole Nguyen of Duelist King.
Nonetheless, a gray zone can‚Äôt protect users and individual investors from scams. But for some local traders, it‚Äôs one of the risks worth taking.
Other challenges include the crypto market‚Äôs self-corrections and the potential effects from the US Federal Reserve‚Äôs interest-rate normalization.
Still, serious supporters like Nicole hope that the trend would eventually lead to practical use cases of blockchain technologies in Vietnam.
Wakabayashi of AppWorks sees the same potential in Vietnam, which has long been known for having a strong pool of technical talent.
‚ÄúJust as we saw in 2018, once this hype cycle passes, those projects with weak fundamentals likely won‚Äôt be around after the dust has settled,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThe beauty of Web3 is that it‚Äôs the developers‚Äô world. If you have a technical background, the sky‚Äôs the limit right now.‚Äù",Thu Huong Le,Terence Lee and Eileen C. Ang,2,"['Analysis', 'Blockchain', 'Fintech', 'Premium Content']",True,True,9

In mid-2021, Oyo hit a valuation of US$9 billion after reportedly raising funds from Microsoft. However, the pandemic took a toll on the firm, forcing it to let go of around 300 employees at the end of 2020. (Read: 6 key findings from Oyo‚Äôs $1.2b IPO filings)

Hello reader,
Last week, I went for my first cycle as a member of the national military reserve. For those not familiar with this, all Singaporean males are required to undergo 10 cycles of military training after their initial two-year stint as a full-time soldier has been completed.
It was a strange feeling experiencing the sights and sounds that were an integral part of my life for a time: the ever-so-slight smell of preservatives in the food, the stale and musky air of the bunks, and the dreaded early mornings.
While most of the week was spent on military procedures, what I really appreciated was talking to some of the other servicemen and taking in as many life lessons as I could. Some of what I learned pertained to family, while others were about careers. In any case, it was nice to realize that learning never really stops.
Speaking of education, India‚Äôs edtech scene is seeing some big moves, as the country‚Äôs top players have come together to form a new regulatory body. What will come of it? That‚Äôs for you to find out in our premium story for today.
Today we look at,

Whether the formation of an organic regulatory body is enough to stave off government intervention in the Indian edtech space.

Watching the watchmen

Image credit: Timmy Loen

The saying ‚Äúwho watches the watchmen?‚Äù is often used to describe the issue of governing or regulating those in power. In India, the country‚Äôs major edtech players are looking to solve this problem with the creation of a self-regulatory body known as the Indian Edtech Consortium (IEC).


Edtech, assemble: Companies such as Byju‚Äôs, Unacademy, upGrad, Vedantu, and Simplilearn make up the IEC. The development comes as the industry grapples with several issues, prompting the country‚Äôs education ministry to announce that it would be working on its own regulatory policy for the sector.


Monkey see, monkey do?: Many of India‚Äôs concerns about edtech have also come amid China‚Äôs crackdowns on its own edtech industry. Following new regulations, edtech companies in China have had to lay off hundreds or even thousands of employees in a bid to stay compliant. The crackdowns have ‚Äúspooked‚Äù edtech startups and investors in India, according to Siddarth Pai, founding partner of 3one4 Capital.


Positive examples: Edtech is not the first industry in India to take a stab at self-regulation. The country‚Äôs advertising sector has been using its own regulatory framework since 1985, allowing it to avoid government regulation. Should the IEC be able to follow this example, edtech firms could see accelerated market opportunities while protecting learners and other stakeholders at the same time.

Believing in BeLive

Co-Founders Lim Kim Hui (L) and Kenneth Tan/ Photo credit: BeLive.

Livestreaming has truly boomed over the last few years, though personally, I‚Äôm not entirely sure what it is about the content format that makes it so entertaining. Perhaps it‚Äôs the live interactions that one can get by chatting with the streamer or just seeing something live instead of plain old television shows. Regardless, Singapore-based BeLive, which provides livestreaming solutions, is looking to capitalize on the phenomenon after bagging US$4.5 million in fresh funding.


The rundown: Currently, BeLive provides live shopping, video analysis, and interactive livestreaming services for firms, with more than 100 million viewers already recorded worldwide. In June last year, it was responsible for launching Z-Live, an in-app livestreaming platform for fashion ecommerce startup Zalora. The platform allows Zalora to interact and receive direct payments from its customers in real time.


New hires: The company is now looking to use the new funds to hire more staff on top of its existing team of 80 to 100 employees. In particular, it‚Äôs looking to hire for roles in business development, customer service, and tech. With this, the firm will be able to expand local operations in overseas markets such as the US, Europe, and the Middle East.


Intelligent solutions: Apart from growing its team and expanding overseas, the firm wants to allocate some of its new capital toward developing AI and machine learning capabilities in livestreaming. It‚Äôs looking to partner with ecommerce giants, apps, and brands to help it in this initiative.

What is a shareholders‚Äô agreement:
So shareholders‚Äô agreement, simply put, it‚Äôs a fancy way of saying it‚Äôs a contract, right?
It‚Äôs all the rights and obligations among the company and all of its shareholders, which is another way of saying all of the owners of the business. You know, oftentimes the way to analogize this for better or for worse is that the purchase of shares when an investor is coming in, you know, through what is usually a subscription agreement or a purchase agreement, right?
Kind of different names for the same thing is the way to think about that is that‚Äôs the wedding, the shareholder‚Äôs agreement is your marriage. And it is life in perpetuity because corporations are perpetual existence entities.
And this is the embodiment, if you will, of all the principles and rights and obligations of your relationship with the owners of the company and the shareholders.
Shareholder‚Äôs agreement in the fundraising process:
We talk about a second objective, which is is that where does this shareholder‚Äôs agreement fit into the process? I mean, look, it‚Äôs a contract. You‚Äôre all intelligent people on this phone. So the reality is we can kind of figure out that OK contracts, they‚Äôre kind of signed at the end.
But in reality, and what you see up on the slide is a very hyper over generalized or hyper simplified version of what the typical fundraising process is. Everything from, sure, figure out your valuation, to kind of prepare the materials, both legal, but more importantly, business-related diligence materials that investors are going to look at.
Start the courtship with investors, the whole dating game, if you will. Which can go on for quite a while in the management meetings and then you get yourself into term sheet negotiation.
So on this slide or for these next few minutes, I want to talk about pitfalls associated with where this shareholder‚Äôs agreement fits in.
Because while it‚Äôs signed all the way at the end, when closing occurs and the champagne is popped or the coffee is had.
The reality is that the negotiations for it and that foundation, if you will, the cement is starting to be made much earlier in the process.
Never negotiate solo:
Pitfall number one is that never negotiate a term sheet solo. Yes, they are non-binding, except for a couple of provisions. But in reality, the truth is that after you have gone through those first three bullets which can go for months, right?
In terms of the courtship in the dating with investors, you finally got a lead investor. You‚Äôve put together a round of folks and all of a sudden now you‚Äôve got a term sheet, which of course has exclusivity provisions, which means you can‚Äôt date or you can‚Äôt be talking to other potential investors outside of the round that you‚Äôve put together. You could easily go 45-60 days, and if you decide this really sucks, it‚Äôs hard to redo that process.
And so pitfall number one is that again, related to the shareholder‚Äôs agreement because the term sheet actually is like the vertebrate or the backbone of what ultimately the term sheet or with the shareholder‚Äôs agreement will have.
It‚Äôs, you know, these things can be anywhere from a few pages to upwards of 10-14 pages.
Never negotiate that solo.
Buffer more time:
Pitfall number two that occurs and you‚Äôll see this when we talk about timeline right again related to a shareholders agreement, which is always estimate more time. You would do this in any other business or project or strategic initiative that you would undertake for your business.
Always buffer way more time than what you think. Anyone telling you that they can get a shareholders agreement done in just a couple of weeks or get docs done in a couple of weeks, amazing, if you can. But the vast majority of these rounds can take anywhere from one to three months from when you signed a term sheet to when closing occurs, you assign the shareholders agreement, the term sheet becomes the shareholder‚Äôs agreement and capital is wired to you.
So again, if you get it done faster, amazing. If not, you want to make sure that you buffer time.
Get experienced counsel:
Pitfall number three, I‚Äôm just going to say it in ten seconds, which is get experienced counsel to do your fundraise.
The example that I give is that look like, you know, we‚Äôre smart lawyers and you know, my 350 partners, the 1400 lawyers across the firm with various specialties related to VC.
We know what we‚Äôre good at. We know what we don‚Äôt do, right? You want to finance a power plant in wherever, I‚Äôm not and we are not the right firm for you.
If you are doing a fundraise involving any technology or venture capital-backed company.
We are the, you know, we are pretty good at that. Let me just say that or we are the most experienced. The analogy that I give folks is that, if you have a brain tumor, as tragic as that would be going to a heart surgeon is not the right option, right?
Heart surgeons are amazing. They could probably figure it out if they studied up enough time. But odds are you probably want to go to a brain surgeon. And so that is the analogy that I would make, because oftentimes, you know, we see that companies, as we start working with them later on, have worked with counsel that‚Äôs a little bit inexperienced or advisors that are inexperienced.
Key terms vs standard terms:
A typical shareholders‚Äô agreement is 60 to 100 plus pages we prefer they‚Äôre much shorter, unfortunately, they tend to go unnecessarily longer and there is no Cliffs Notes version of it.
And so my point here is that what is important, particularly for early-stage founders, is that you got it ‚Äì not only do you need to get it right upfront, but you need to focus on ‚Äúkey ROI terms‚Äù.
It‚Äôs important to know what are key terms to focus on versus what our standard or market standard terms on which should be lower ROI and relying upon the fact that hundreds upon hundreds of thousands of fundraisers over the last 30-40 years have built kind of a market understanding of what is common.
Standard terms:
These are not unimportant terms. They actually are very key. Anything in a contract, a lawyer telling you that, hey, that‚Äôs not important, don‚Äôt worry about it. It would be remiss in doing that.
At the same time, many of the provisions that you see up here, things like anti-dilution rights, conversion rights, you know, what are the information rights that investors get?
And you can use this to your benefit when negotiating with your lead investors to say that look, 20% of the last, you know, fundraises over the last five years have this provision.
Why are we rotating over on this one and, you know, kind of flip positional leverage to your benefit?
Leverage market precedence:
What you see here on this table are examples of, less aggressive in terms of more founder favorable and investor neutral positions all the way to more aggressive or investor favorable provisions.
And this is the type of data where the type of information with specific percentages Again, it arms you up to negotiate better. Oftentimes in shareholders agreements, you‚Äôll see that people, the investors will negotiate a hard-wired exit rights which say that‚Äôs, you know, say, five to seven years after our investment.
The company must deliver an exit, failing which, the investors have certain rights to be able to force or effect a sale or an IPO of the company. If, however, they become more contentious versions of a drag along This is a perfect example of where using market standard terms to benefit you to say, listen, it‚Äôs a series A funded company. Are we really talking about scenarios where we are going to drag the business out from underneath the founders and we are negotiating that in our shareholders‚Äô agreement today about things we‚Äôre going to do five, six, seven years from now?
Why can‚Äôt we deal with that a little bit further?
It‚Äôs a perfect example of where over-rotating on rights associated with scenarios where we may forcibly sell the business in year two or three, probably worthwhile to just leverage market precedent goes to really go or wherever it may be as your advisor on how to just leverage market precedent to just move past some of these lower ROI points.",Melvin Chen,Nathaniel Fetalvero,0,"['Premium Content', 'TIA Originals', 'Videos']",True,True,6

Patamar Capital, angel investor Oliver Jung, and existing investors such as Golden Gate Ventures, Venturra Discovery, Hustle Fund, iSeed SEA, and DoorDash executive Gokul Rajaram also participated in the round.
The investment boosts Mio‚Äôs total funding raised to US$9.1 million.

Mio founders / Photo credit: Mio

Founded in June 2020, Mio uses a network of resellers to sell fresh produce such as fruit, vegetables, and meat. The company was set up by former IDG Ventures associate¬†Trung Huynh, Scommerce co-founder An Pham, ex-DigiPay executive Tu Le, and former Uber Vietnam operations lead Long Pham.
Around a year after its inception, when the company raised a US$1 million seed round, it had 150 active resellers. Today, that number has grown by 10x to 1,500. Mio‚Äôs gross merchandise value (GMV) has also increased by more than 50x in the last 12 months.
Huynh credits the company‚Äôs growth to its referral programs, which offer a fee to resellers who can onboard other people to the platform. Existing resellers also get additional bonuses if the individual they refer performs well. In a statement, Mio said that each reseller can earn up to US$400 from these referral bonuses as well as from the 10% commission they get for every order they facilitate.
‚ÄúWe spend very little in marketing. We don‚Äôt use digital marketing or billboards ‚Äì we focus on the referral,‚Äù Huynh told Tech in Asia.
Mio has around 240 employees, an increase of 5x since May last year. Around 50% of its headcount consists of its operational taskforce who work in the company‚Äôs warehouses and fulfillment centers.
Doubling down on the social commerce model
Mio plans to use the fresh funding to put up more fulfillment centers and tap into new cities in Vietnam. It currently covers Ho Chi Minh and its satellite cities, such as Binh Duong, Dong Nai, and Long An, which are located in the southern region of the country. This year, it plans to enter the northern region, where the country‚Äôs capital city of Hanoi is located.
‚ÄúHanoi has similarities with Ho Chi Minh, and it also has several satellite cities. We aim to be present in 10 cities by the end of 2022,‚Äù Huynh noted.

The company also wants to improve its logistics and supply chain, which Huynh said is important for Mio in the long run. That‚Äôs why the company prefers to control fulfillment centers and the delivery process itself. Today, its delivery courier can handle almost 80% of the company‚Äôs total transactions.
‚ÄúDuring the time when the order is spiked, or there is a special event, we cooperate with third-party logistics,‚Äù Huynh said.
The company currently sells more than 10,000 products every day, and it targets to fulfill 100,000 orders per day by the end of 2022.

Huynh revealed that he sees interest from businesses in the hotel, restaurant, and cafe sector that want to source fresh produce from his company in bulk due to the attractive prices. With the pressure to increase GMVs after raising a significant amount of funding, Huynh finds the offers tempting.
However, he consistently rejects such requests to keep the company focused on using its reseller network and reaching customers nationwide.
Mio has expanded its offerings to FMCG products due to requests from its customers. However, these offerings only occupy around 10% of Mio‚Äôs total stock keeping units. Huynh explained that while FMCG products are easier for fulfillment ‚Äì as they typically have a longer shelf life than other categories ‚Äì they bring lower margins.
‚ÄúMajority of our GMV still comes from fresh produce, so it will still be our focus,‚Äù Huynh added.",Aditya Hadi Pratama,Collin Furtado and Lorenzo Kyle Subido,0,"['Ecommerce', 'Investments', 'News', 'Startups']",True,False,3

We break down the big and messy topics of Asia‚Äôs tech and startup community. Get the newsletter in your inbox everyday with a Premium subscription.
Hello reader,
Fairy tales, movies, and books keep us steeped in the savior narrative. Some of last year‚Äôs box office juggernauts such as Spider-Man: No Way Home and Dune play to our never-ending fascination with a hero who swoops in to save the day. However, sometimes we forget to draw the line between fiction and reality.
In real life, things are more complicated: Even good intentions may have negative outcomes. The savior complex ‚Äì or white knight syndrome ‚Äì is defined as the need to ‚Äúsave‚Äù people by attempting to fix their problems. It‚Äôs an issue that negatively affects countless people. Those with a savior complex may experience frustration, loss of control, resentment, and a sense of failure, among other  unpleasant emotions.
Usually, most of us don‚Äôt need a ‚Äúsavior‚Äù ‚Äì we learn to deal with life‚Äôs problems by focusing on the actions in our control and accepting the ones we can‚Äôt control. However, occasionally, as in UangTeman‚Äôs case, there is a desperate need for a white knight. Today, we see how the Jakarta-based online lender could be saved from the brink of collapse.
Today we look at,

How troubled UangTeman may have found a lifeline

More than a helping hand

UangTeman is in dire need of capital. After having stopped disbursing loans ‚Äì its sole business ‚Äì since the early days of the pandemic, the company hasn‚Äôt paid employees‚Äô salaries since the end of 2020, and may be criminally liable for nonpayment of employee income taxes and social security.
The embattled startup is not in good shape but behold, IN Financial Technologies Holdings, which has come to the rescue as a potential acquirer and white knight in UangTeman‚Äôs story.


Signed, and sealed, but not yet delivered: While the two firms signed a term sheet on December 24, 2021, it is not a done deal yet. According to the timeline laid out in the letter, due diligence is slated to start this month, with the acquisition process set to be completed by April 1, 2022. As part of the acquisition process, UangTeman is seeking to extend its lending license from Otoritas Jasa Keuangan (OJK), Indonesia‚Äôs financial services authority.


One promise too many: Given the online lender‚Äôs previously unfulfilled promises, former UangTeman employees remain skeptical about whether the deal will go through. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it makes sense that due diligence is scheduled for three months. One month should be enough for a company whose main operation ‚Äì [loan] disbursement ‚Äì has stopped since April 2020,‚Äù said an ex-staffer.


Boiling point: Several UangTeman ex-employees have also signed a letter seeking an audience with Bambang Budiawan, OJK‚Äôs head of oversight for non-bank financial institutions, on Friday, January 14. One source said that, should the meeting fall through, some former  staffers may consider holding a demonstration at the OJK offices.

728987,2022-01-17T08:00:58,Is Asia ready for Sequoia‚Äôs perpetual fund model?,"It‚Äôs one thing for a VC firm to say that the 10-year fund cycle ‚Äì the typical time period a fund has to invest and make returns ‚Äì has become obsolete, but it‚Äôs quite another matter when the firm in question is Sequoia Capital.
Roelof Botha, a partner at the startup investment giant, penned an essay last October announcing the company‚Äôs ‚Äúboldest innovation yet‚Äù ‚Äì The Sequoia Fund.
Instead of a 10-year window for VCs to invest and ultimately return capital to their limited partners (LPs), the Sequoia Fund offers an ‚Äúopen-ended liquid portfolio‚Äù in a selection of Sequoia-backed companies. This means LPs can participate in a company‚Äôs fundraise at any time from inception to IPO and beyond.

This is a sea change in Sequoia‚Äôs modus operandi, but as Botha wrote, the model is currently limited to its businesses in the US and Europe. For the time being, it excludes the firm‚Äôs operations in India, China, and Southeast Asia, where its portfolio companies include the likes of Gojek, JD.com, and Oyo.
It‚Äôs unclear why Asia is currently excluded or what the plan is moving forward (Sequoia India declined to comment). But based on conversations with VCs across Southeast Asia and India, one explanation is that Asia‚Äôs startup scene simply isn‚Äôt ready for a perpetual or longer-term funding model.
‚ÄúOur ecosystem is so young,‚Äù says a representative from a venture capital firm that invests in Southeast Asia, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Impatient capital, impermanent companies?
It‚Äôs worth noting that evergreen funds, which go on indefinitely, do exist.
‚ÄúIn many ways, large family offices and endowments are evergreen funds,‚Äù says the venture capital representative who asked to remain anonymous. ‚ÄúThe main difference is just that it‚Äôs Sequoia that‚Äôs the fund manager now.‚Äù
It‚Äôs similar to how SPACs, which use the same methods as reverse mergers or backdoor listings, are merely a new name for an old concept.
At the same time, however, the perpetual fund model that Sequoia is proposing ‚Äì at least for now ‚Äì is foreign to venture capital. In his essay, Sequoia‚Äôs Botha pointed out how perpetual funding would remove the ‚Äúrigid‚Äù and ‚Äúartificial‚Äù 10-year funding horizon that has been used since the 1970s, a model that Botha described as ‚Äúthe business equivalent of floppy disks.‚Äù
Exposure to venture investments means the promise of larger gains.
‚ÄúFor me personally, [the new fund model is] not revolutionary ‚Äì it‚Äôs evolutionary,‚Äù said Michael Blakey of Cocoon Capital in an episode of Unreasonable, a podcast he co-hosts with fellow investors Hian Goh and Vishal Harnal. ‚ÄúI think the one thing they‚Äôve said that I think is really true is that nobody has really looked at how to change the VC model.‚Äù
Harnal, who is a managing partner at 500 Southeast Asia, added that the 10-year cycle may have been based on how long it took to take a company public back in the 1960s or 1970s ‚Äì when venture capital was born.
In an article written on freelance platform Toptal, venture capital consultant Alex Graham echoes Botha‚Äôs major points. Open-ended or perpetual funds can truly focus on ‚Äúlong-term capital appreciation,‚Äù as they have no end date and can continuously raise capital, he said.

Endowment funds of universities like Harvard are an example of evergreen funds / Photo credit: Wikimedia Commons

While there are benefits to this model ‚Äì such as an alignment with long-term sustainable growth or the flexibility to adjust investment theses ‚Äì there are also drawbacks. One of them, according to Graham, is illiquidity.
Endowment funds, for instance, are structured so that they can earn dividends and other investment income (while leaving the principal amount untouched). But investors in an evergreen venture fund cannot expect a similar regular cash payout, as startups generally don‚Äôt disburse dividends.
At the same time, exposure to venture investments means the promise of larger gains. In the US, venture capital funds rose by a median 88.1% between June 2020 to June 2021, according to estimates from investment firm Cambridge Associates. That‚Äôs a substantially higher rate compared to, say, Harvard University‚Äôs endowment fund, whose 33.6% return for 2021 was already unprecedented.
The caveat, however, is that evergreen VC funds are still relatively rare.
A more important comparison, perhaps, is between evergreen VC funds and traditional VC funds. For his article, Graham looked into data from PitchBook and found that returns were largely similar from a total value to paid in (TVPI) standpoint. But there was some divergence when the TVPI was broken down into its two components: residual value to paid in (RVPI) and distributed to paid in (DPI).
Evergreen VC funds have higher RVPI, which means they accumulate higher returns over a longer period of time. However, they have lower DPI, showing that returns are slower to be distributed back to LPs. For traditional VC funds, the two figures are more closely aligned.
The caveat, however, is that evergreen VC funds are still relatively rare. Based on the data he found, Graham estimated that there were 200 evergreen VC funds globally ‚Äì a tiny fraction of the 10,000 VC funds worldwide that are classified as ‚Äúventure capital‚Äù funds on Crunchbase.
Too early for Asia?
So, would a perpetual fund structure be game-changing and relevant for Asian VC funds? Or is the ecosystem still too young to adopt it?
In his essay announcement, Botha said Sequoia‚Äôs funding of tech innovators ‚Äútaught us that [such companies] take more than a few years to build.‚Äù
‚ÄúIn recent years, many of our most promising companies have chosen to stay private longer, building scale and expanding their strategic footprint before debuting as public-market leaders,‚Äù he explained.
Botha was mostly referring to Silicon Valley powerhouses like Apple, Google, Unity, and Zoom. But he also said that these companies compound their advantage for decades, with ‚Äúmuch of their value accruing long after an IPO.‚Äù That last point may hold relevance for Asia now, considering more tech startups from the region are going public.
A few solid pros are more powerful than a dozen cons.
‚ÄúBefore the pandemic, we saw how many tech unicorns in the Asia region ‚Äì and even globally ‚Äì continued to raise increasingly massive mega rounds in an effort to support their rapid growth without having to go public,‚Äù says Yinglan Tan, founding managing partner at Insignia Ventures Partners and formerly a partner at Sequoia Capital India. However, ‚Äúthis effort to stay private as long as possible shifted 180 degrees as the pandemic hit,‚Äù he adds.
Sandeep Murthy, partner at Indian VC firm Lightbox Ventures, finds the permanent capital model to be appealing. He also points out that Sequoia‚Äôs open-ended fund lets it invest in ‚Äúcategory-creating‚Äù companies, which can often take longer than 10 years to become exit-ready.
‚ÄúAs Steve Jobs once said, a few solid pros are more powerful than a dozen cons,‚Äù he quotes.

Sequoia partner Roelof Botha, who penned the Sequoia Fund essay / Photo credit: Sequoia Capital

When Lightbox Ventures started, it too aimed to eventually adopt a similar structure. But Murthy says doing so would call into question the very nature of venture capital itself.
‚ÄúIs it still a high-risk, high-return asset class that is based on small amounts of capital returning large sums?‚Äù Murthy asks. ‚ÄúOr are we now looking at venture capital as a diversified, moderate risk asset class that will merge high-risk returns with high-growth, low-risk bets to give overall more predictable outcomes?‚Äù
Plus, making the change to a perpetual fund structure may be less of a challenge in a bear market, such as now, Murthy says. With the global economy recovering from the worst of the pandemic, company valuations seem to move only in one direction: up.
Sequoia is doing this because they can.
‚ÄúThe test for the model will be when there is a downturn, and people have to deal with the change in private values impacting their position in what they thought was a liquid, easy-to-value asset,‚Äù he explains.
Nonetheless, 500 Southeast Asia‚Äôs Harnal speculated in the podcast episode that the reason Sequoia chose not to adopt the model in Asia for now may be a simple one:
‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm sitting in their shoes, I may not necessarily want to start by having all my funds across all markets come under this structure,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI first want to see how it goes: let‚Äôs start with two, see how that progresses, and if it works, then let‚Äôs expand it over.‚Äù
The holy grail
All that aside, the Southeast Asia-centric VC representative we spoke to finds that, ultimately, it is the fund manager ‚Äì rather than the startups ‚Äì who benefits more from employing an evergreen fund structure.
‚ÄúThis is just another way to get ‚Äòpermanent capital,‚Äô‚Äù says the representative. ‚ÄúSequoia is doing this because they can. Evergreen capital is like the holy grail for many fund managers. It‚Äôs a load off if you don‚Äôt have to keep raising 10-year funds.‚Äù
In the bigger picture, though, this talk of employing an open-ended model might not matter all that much. First off, the representative explains, it will be harder for Asian VCs to adopt the fund model: Not every firm has Sequoia‚Äôs track record or its resources.
Second, startups sign on with Sequoia for its brand ‚Äì not necessarily the structure it uses, adds the representative.
Plus, even without a perpetual fund structure, founders today have more fundraising options on the table, such as continuation funds or funds that specialize in secondary shares.

On the other hand, a perpetual fund may also be the natural next step for VCs as Asia‚Äôs startup scene matures. A paper by the European Corporate Governance Institute found that ‚Äúmore reputable‚Äù VCs tend to have a longer involvement in their portfolio firms, even after they IPO, and this translates to better long-term performances by the companies they‚Äôve invested in.
As Harnal pointed out in the podcast, recent market forces may also make the evergreen structure more popular. Chief among these factors is the increasingly blurred lines between hedge funds, private equity, growth funds, or venture capital.
‚ÄúYou win at a game like this by ensuring that you have access to capital in the way you want to invest it, being able to pounce on it without friction, and at the speed at which you want to do it,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúYou can iterate and spin up new products, you can invest in new opportunities, without necessarily being beholden to a fund structure or where in the capital line you invest.‚Äù",Rachel Chia,Putra Muskita and Jaclyn Tiu,0,"['Analysis', 'Premium Content']",True,True,8

Hi readers,
Sea Group‚Äôs story is about taking big chances. It began with three young people ‚Äì Forrest Li, Gang Ye, and David Chen ‚Äì trying their luck far away from their hometowns in China. Together, they grew the embryo of a business out of a shophouse in Singapore.
After the success of their online games ‚Äì most notably Free Fire ‚Äì they didn‚Äôt stay in their comfort zone. Instead, they tripled the business by going into fintech and ecommerce, which later propelled these co-founders to the ranks of the richest in their adopted country.
Nowadays, when most startups in Southeast Asia are considering regional expansion, Sea has already entered Latin America and even Europe, as highlighted in our org chart of the company. The group has also ventured into digital banking.
Our org chart highlights the key figures who have steered Sea‚Äôs past and recent moves. If you‚Äôre in sales, human resources, or corporate relations and want to connect with the company, this piece will help you cut the red tape.

For instance, two executives appear to be leaving the Malaysian Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC) after less than a year at the government agency.

In many of the articles I write, it‚Äôs hard not to mention how we‚Äôre now operating in a digital-first environment; the pandemic has instituted changes that are here to stay.
Obviously, governments play a very important role in enabling the continued development of our respective digital economies. As such, the news that two MDEC executives are leaving after less than a year in their respective roles might cause some eyebrows to raise.


The pair in question: Aiza Azreen Ahmad has resigned as chief digital business officer, according to sources, while it is understood that chief financial officer Nora Junita Hussaini is serving her notice period.


No 12 months: The executives who quit had worked at the agency for less than a year. Aiza joined in March after a three-month stint as CEO of Pertama Digital, a govtech company listed on Bursa Malaysia. Nora Junita, a chartered accountant, joined MDEC last year on January 21.


Replacement: MDEC has brought in Ashran Ghazi, the former CEO of Malaysian Global Innovation &amp; Creativity Centre, as a contract-for-service consultant.

728331,2022-01-14T04:40:32,Why Indian edtech‚Äôs self-regulation move won‚Äôt stop govt intervention,"Top Indian edtech players such as Byju‚Äôs, Unacademy, upGrad, Vedantu, and Simplilearn have come together to form a self-regulatory body called the Indian Edtech Consortium (IEC).

Photo credit: 123rf.com

Formed under the aegis of the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI), the consortium aims to make online education more accessible to all.
The formation of the IEC comes at a time when the Indian edtech industry is plagued with cases of bad behavior and predatory pricing, so much that these cases have reached the Indian Parliament.
Last week, the country‚Äôs education ministry said that it would be working out a regulation policy for the edtech industry, which has boomed amid the pandemic. There were reports that edtech companies were exploiting students with loans for fee-based courses.
‚ÄúStudents should not be lured to take loans by false promises from [edtech firms],‚Äù said the Indian Education Minister at the time.
An industry insider tells Tech in Asia on the condition of anonymity that the IEC was formed in response to this announcement by the government.
‚ÄúIn order to have the power to negotiate with the government, you need to have all the constituents on board as one voice rather than separate voices,‚Äù says the person.
However, the IAMAI denies this, saying that the framework had been in the works for the past six months. ‚ÄúThis is nowhere in anyway a response to what the government is doing around edtech,‚Äù Bhanupreet Saini, head of public policy at IAMAI, tells Tech in Asia.

Concerns of going the China route
Regardless of when the framework for the self-regulatory body started, some see the timing of the announcement as a sign that edtech firms in the country are concerned. This is especially the case after China, a neighboring country to India, took a hard stand on its US$48 billion edtech sector.
The country introduced regulations turning these education firms into non-profit organizations, putting restrictions on foreign investment, and forbidding firms in the segment to go public, among other measures.
See also: Inside China‚Äôs crusade against the education sector‚Äôs excesses
The aftershocks of this crackdown are still being felt in China. Just this week, New Oriental, an online tutoring firm in the country, said it laid off 60,000 employees. Even TikTok parent firm ByteDance reportedly fired hundreds of employees working on its edtech platforms in August 2021.
‚ÄúEducation is a sensitive subject for any government, and the Chinese crackdown has spooked startups and investors alike,‚Äù Siddarth Pai, founding partner of 3one4 Capital, tells Tech in Asia. An organization like the IEC, he adds, would facilitate dialogue on regulations and become a forum to grow edtech in a sustainable way.
With the Indian national elections coming in the next two years ‚Äì and several other key state elections happening this year ‚Äì the government is unlikely to turn a blind eye to the social issues that affect voters from more vulnerable sections of the society.
‚ÄúGrowth at all costs cannot be the motto, especially in this space,‚Äù says Ankur Bansal, co-founder and director of alternative credit firm BlackSoil.

Photo credit: 123rf.com

The Indian education ministry tells Tech in Asia that it hopes the consortium would be able to adhere to the self-regulatory code of conduct that they have set out for themselves. A ministry spokesperson clarified, however, that the department is already working on an advisory on edtech, which will reiterate the existing laws surrounding ecommerce in the country under the Consumer Protection Act.
‚ÄúIn course of time, edtech players will also have to abide by data protection laws and other such laws which are concerned with consumer protection and data privacy,‚Äù the spokesperson adds.
A mature industry?
The last two years have seen a meteoric rise in online education in India, with billions of dollars in funding flowing in from global and domestic investors. The sector is well on its way to becoming a US$4 billion market by 2025.
Industry experts say that the time is right to form a regulatory body for the maturing industry, as it will allow market participants to provide their products and services in a fair environment. Several other mature industries such as advertising already follow a self-regulatory code of conduct.
The country‚Äôs advertising sector set up the self-regulatory body ‚Äì called the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) ‚Äì in 1985, and it has managed to stave off government intervention in regulating the industry. In fact, edtech companies are reportedly already consulting the ASCI to get their regulatory framework right.
Some, like Vedanta CEO Vamsi Krishna,¬†see the IEC as a crucial step toward protecting learners, as more students, teachers, and stakeholders become a part of the online education ecosystem. Establishing a common code of conduct and putting together a mechanism to address grievances will be important moving forward.
‚ÄúWith the sole purpose of improving the delivery of education services, it is now crucial for us to foster and sustain stakeholder trust by safeguarding the consumer‚Äôs interest as a practice,‚Äù Mayank Kumar, co-founder and managing director of upGrad and co-chairperson of the IAMAI edtech committee, tells Tech in Asia.
Representatives from Unacademy and Simplilearn declined to comment.

727576,2022-01-14T04:00:27,Meet the platform that‚Äôs encouraging digital and financial inclusion in Southeast Asia,"Digitalization has taken Southeast Asia by storm, and it‚Äôs been helped in no small measure by the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2020 alone, the region saw a 9.9% growth in internet users, taking the total number to 463 million websurfers.
However, while aggregated statistics and anecdotes paint a promising picture, full digital and financial inclusion remains elusive. Though Singapore took the top spot in the 2021 Roland Berger Digital Inclusion Index, other Southeast Asian countries crowded into the bottom half. This is because of the ‚Äúaccessibility disconnect,‚Äù which is what happens when user habits outpace infrastructure growth.
Shareit, an online and offline digital content platform, wants to tear down the barriers to digital inclusion in emerging markets and provide access to the underserved.
The questions of accessibility and affordability
In its earliest days, Shareit focused on building a cross platform file sharing app, which then evolved into an online and offline file sharing, content streaming, and gaming platform.
Additionally, it‚Äôs ‚Äúa powerful, open ecosystem with apps from many developers,‚Äù says Karam Malhotra, partner and global vice president of Shareit Group. ‚ÄúShareit unlocks the ability for many types of phones to share many types of content without the need for an internet connection or mobile data consumption and is downloadable for free.‚Äù
This was a key focus for the firm, with users‚Äô data demands growing exponentially.
‚ÄúBefore, people were happy to play a 10MB game. Now, they‚Äôre not happy playing anything less than a 1GB game,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt went from Nokia‚Äôs Snake to Call of Duty. The amount of data users required grew by 100x.‚Äù

Photo credit: Trung Vo Chi

Malhotra adds that the quality of mobile internet connectivity remains poor in emerging countries, and people there also worry about the high cost of mobile data consumption. These challenges around downloading content from the internet have shut people out from participating fully in the digital economy. An alternative for sharing content and apps would make a difference.
Tapping into human proclivities
‚ÄúShareit‚Äôs growth is built on the principle that sharing makes people feel good, which is facilitated by our high-quality user experience and word of mouth marketing,‚Äù Malhotra says.
This organic foundation strongly drove adoption. While Shareit was launched as a simple file-sharing platform, the team realized it was becoming a trusted source of referrals in underserved communities, becoming one of the fastest growing apps globally. To date, nearly 2.4 billion users have installed Shareit Group‚Äôs diversified suite of applications.
‚ÄúNear-distance peer-to-peer is the world‚Äôs largest offline-online social ecosystem,‚Äù Malhotra says. ‚ÄúShareit enables a digital economy we don‚Äôt even know about.‚Äù
Peer-to-peer sharing helps in another way: word-of-mouth is the fastest way to build trust. In fact, a study by Google‚Äã shows that most people discover new apps through friends and family.
Malhotra says shared conversation is key to facilitating this trust. ‚ÄúEvery popular game has at least 30 imitators,‚Äù he points out. ‚ÄúHow do you know which is the legitimate one that doesn‚Äôt have viruses, malware, or spyware? You ask your friend.‚Äù
Peer-to-peer sharing also organically improves digital literacy as friends trust and teach each other about how apps work. This, in turn, leads to financial inclusion. Malhotra points to how people getting used to ecommerce has also led to increased usage of and faith in e-wallets like Alipay or GCash.
Serving the underserved
During the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Digital Inclusion Index points out that aid and credible information could not reach the low-income and less educated demographic that is not online. The digital divide, therefore, is costly in many ways.
In this respect, the Shareit team felt a responsibility to help the underserved access the right apps and products during pandemic-induced lockdowns. For example, the firm helped spread awareness of the Philippines government‚Äôs national vaccination program via digital content sharing within the app, racking up 100 million impressions.
‚ÄúPeople were sharing a lot more in their communities. We knew we had so many more eyeballs on the system,‚Äù says Malhotra.
As a foundational ‚Äúplumbing‚Äù piece of Southeast Asia‚Äôs digital infrastructure, Shareit now helps ecommerce players understand and reach underserved consumers and digital banks in order to reach the unbanked.
‚ÄúOne of the biggest ways we really helped fintech and ecommerce companies like GCash and Shopee was to achieve true financial inclusion in mass markets,‚Äù Malhotra shares, also pointing out that the firm curates campaigns to help brands reach out to an incremental and almost untapped audience.

To do this, Shareit emphasizes its localization efforts, analyzing the cultural background and language environment of a target market and adapting the app‚Äôs design, interaction, and functionality accordingly. It also invests in local teams and talents to meet clients‚Äô demands as best it can.
Tapping into over 700 global advertisers and their existing user bases, Shareit also helps its clients with awareness campaigns, user acquisition, digital payment options, and seamless user monetization via extensive audience networks. Clients can then reinvest the revenue into further user acquisition ‚Äì Malhotra refers to this virtuous cycle as the ‚Äúflywheel‚Äù model.
Digital inclusion is an imperative
As much as 80% of Southeast Asia‚Äôs internet users have made at least one purchase online, with 60 million new users joining the internet economy since Covid-19 hit, according to the e-Conomy SEA report 2021.
Besides ecommerce ‚Äì and the related e-wallets ‚Äì the online media, travel, and transport sectors are all likely to grow.
Younger adults are the fastest adopters and are likely to become the economic core and growth driver of digital services. Enabling digital and financial inclusion will allow this key demographic to contribute efficiently to the economy and improve social cohesion as well.
‚ÄúI think Asia will mature in the next five years ‚Äì everything will be built around sharing,‚Äù Malhotra says, pointing to the success of social commerce and group buying in China.
‚ÄúSimilarly, on the fintech side, there‚Äôs so much we can do to educate people more and make them aware of the opportunities available to them via digital currencies.‚Äù

Shareit Group is dedicated to building high-quality content platforms where it connects users and content globally. It has made strides in eliminating digital content limitations caused by external factors, making digital content easily accessible to everyone.

Founded by Zhen Yu Yong in 2018 and formerly known as Torus, Web3Auth eases the authentication process to enter blockchain-based apps, especially for new users.
To access accounts on crypto wallets or blockchain apps, users usually need to enter a string of words called a seed phrase, which keeps the account secure. According to Web3Auth, this process may alienate new crypto users and deter them from further exploring blockchain-based platforms.
Web3Auth allows developers to provide a more common login flow ‚Äì similar to the sign-in pages of platforms like Google and Twitter ‚Äì for their new users. The platform also lets developers continue offering seed phrase authentication for their current users.

Hi there,
I spend a lot of time scanning through reviews of products I‚Äôd like to buy and, TBH, sometimes the comments don‚Äôt help at all.
I like to think that‚Äôs why live commerce grew popular in the first place: You could just ask the person on your screen all your earth-shaking questions about the shirt they were selling.
I must confess there‚Äôs a reason I bring up shirts. I‚Äôm on the hunt for one, preferably black, and it turns out that Flipkart‚Äôs Myntra ‚Äì my go-to shopping site ‚Äì has 6,500 different black shirts for women. Can you really fault me for being picky?
A gentle nudge from a live streamer might have really helped in this scenario. Understandably, entrepreneurs and analysts believe live commerce might be just what‚Äôs needed to bring new customers to ecommerce. Given that only about 100 million of India‚Äôs 700 million internet users shop online in India, live commerce has its work cut out.
And with all that in mind, my colleague, Samreen, set out to learn whether India‚Äôs live commerce scene could replicate the success that the business model found in China. This week‚Äôs Big Story takes us along on her expedition.
This week, we‚Äôll also dive into what shopping could look like if we removed barriers like our screens and jumped right into the metaverse.

THE HOT TAKEBuilding a metaverse for retail and ecommerce

Inside Samsung 837X metaverse on Decentraland. The event featuring Samsung‚Äôs metaverse store is over, but visitors continue to sign in.

Here‚Äôs what happened:

Facebook‚Äôs rebranding as Meta put the spotlight on the metaverse ‚Äì a virtual universe that was already in the making.
It made people curious about what the metaverse could actually look like.
While gaming companies have a head start in the voyage into the metaverse, retailers have begun experimenting with what commerce might look like in the new reality.

Here‚Äôs our take:
Recently, an old video resurfaced, giving us a glimpse of what shopping virtually in Walmart could look like. While the video itself drew mixed reactions, I much prefer Mastercard‚Äôs idea of the metaverse.
Instead of letting us wander around Walmart‚Äôs aisles with a floating torso (which unnervingly knows how much milk I have in the fridge) that pops up every now and then, Mastercard‚Äôs version of the metaverse depicts two friends in a park.
One of them describes a pair of sneakers that pop into the other‚Äôs peripheral vision. The second friend goes on to customize the NFT for her digital avatar while the actual product lands up at her doorstep IRL in a few days.
Here‚Äôs the twist: The park itself was in the metaverse, and the friends who met up in the park never left their homes.
Comparisons aside, here‚Äôs what is happening in real time: On the one hand, there are companies already experimenting with merging commerce and gaming. These include Epic Games, Roblox, and Scuti, a retail marketplace where gamers can use their awards to buy real-world products like sneakers or headphones.

An image from luxury brand Balenciaga‚Äôs collection on Fortnite / Photo credit: Epic Games/ Fortnite

For example: Luxury brand Balenciaga‚Äôs digital garments are on Fortnite. A Gucci bag sold for US$4,115 on Roblox last year ‚Äì this bag costs US$3,400 IRL.
On the other hand, there‚Äôs a new wave of companies building metaverse and VR platforms for different brands like New York-headquartered Obsess.
Startups like Obsess that are working in experiential retail could well shore up the investor interest that roll-up brands have seen recently. But there is another way to go about building the metaverse for shopping. For instance, Vietnam-based RFOX (RedFox Labs) is building virtual shopfronts in a virtual marketplace and offering them to retailers.
The difference between the two is subtle but substantial: While Obsess makes virtual stores for standalone brands and RFOX offers similar services to its clients, the latter already has a ‚Äúmall‚Äù to set up stores ‚Äì a virtual marketplace called RFOX Valt.
Co-founded by Ben Fairbank, who formerly worked at Grab, RFOX Valt comprises four quarters, featuring a mix of auctionable premium shops, some marquee storefronts, and places earmarked for concerts and events ‚Äì much like in real-world malls and shopping centers. This past December, RFOX auctioned 25 stores for 291.4891 Ethereum (about US$ 1.2 million).
The broader plan is to replicate this virtual marketplace for consumers in the Philippines, Indonesia, and other Southeast Asian countries. But while companies adapt to a metaverse still in the making, the early birds might get the juiciest of worms. Obsess, for instance, has clients like Ralph Lauren and Tommy Hilfiger.
And if denizens of the metaverse don‚Äôt want to don clothes from a specific brand, they can also design their own NFT wardrobes through projects like The Fabricant Studio, hosted by The Fabricant, a digital fashion house headquartered in Amsterdam.

An image from The Fabricant‚Äôs collection for Puma/ Photo credit: Kerry Murphy/The Fabricant

The company envisions the metaverse as a place where there are cyber materials to choose from, while meta tailors, professional buyers, and multilabel retailers all work together to create decentralized fashion. While the devil is in the details, this trend could take off in Shein-esque fashion. After all, people spend thousands of dollars on virtual clothing ‚Äì a designer made US$15,000 to $20,000 in just three weeks by selling digital kimonos for about US$140 each.
Aside from luxury brands, companies like Samsung are already exploring the new frontier. Samsung jumped into the metaverse with the Samsung 837X, a virtual store modeled after its flagship New York City real-life counterpart. Though this virtual store was a temporary one, the South Korea-based company is likely to take the experience to other platforms. (Its VC arm Samsung Next has already invested in related projects such as The Sandbox, Axie Infinity, etc.)
The future of shopping could very well involve digital avatars trying out clothes, shoes, and sunglasses before buying ‚Äúphygital‚Äù goods. Meanwhile, the creation of shopping stores and malls in the metaverse ‚Äì modeled around those in IRL ‚Äì seems like an obvious next step, and holds a wealth of unlocked potential.
As I tinker with the idea of getting a car, the metaverse could have offered customers like me ‚Äì who are wary about stepping outdoors amid the Covid-19 pandemic ‚Äì the chance to test out cars on a Formula One track. After all, the metaverse is all about pushing boundaries and ideas we are familiar with.
But the newness of the tech means most glimpses of shopping in the metaverse are purposely only slightly altered versions of reality.
That‚Äôs why there are no cars floating mid-air in the metaverse yet ‚Äì it allows people to make a smoother transition to the metaverse. ‚ÄúThere is no playbook for brands to have it so far removed from what they have now,‚Äù says RFOX‚Äôs Fairbank, adding that retailers are hestiant about moving ‚Äútoo far from the conventional showroom.‚Äù
Businesses at the moment seem to be throwing pebbles into the deep waters of the metaverse, seeing how far the ripples go. Perhaps there really is some wisdom in treading with caution in a world whose building blocks are still coming together. But then again, the metaverse might be just the place for the bold to take chances. After all, what would lure us to a world that‚Äôs almost the same as the one we‚Äôre already in?

UangTeman is also seeking to extend its lending license from Otoritas Jasa Keuangan (OJK), Indonesia‚Äôs financial services authority.
The acquirer in question is IN Financial Technologies Holdings, a company registered in Singapore. It has a subsidiary called INFT, which bills itself as ‚ÄúAsia‚Äôs first community-driven digital business account.‚Äù INFT is also registered with the Singapore Fintech Association.
Tech in Asia has reached out to UangTeman CEO Aidil Zulkifli and INFT chief executive Eldwin Wong for comment. A spokesperson for FTI Consulting, UangTeman‚Äôs financial advisor, confirms that the letter is legitimate.

UangTeman founder and CEO Aidil Zulkifli / Photo credit: UangTeman

While a term sheet was signed on December 24, 2021, it is not yet a done deal. According to a timeline set out in the letter, due diligence is scheduled to start this month, with the acquisition process to be completed by April 1, 2022.
Once the deal is complete, UangTeman would implement a capital injection plan. In the letter, it commits to settle outstanding salaries, taxes, social security, and other employee rights once the funds have come in.
‚ÄúThis would be contingent on approval from OJK on the capital injection plan and the completion of the acquisition process by the investor,‚Äù says the FTI Consulting spokesperson in their statement.
However, former UangTeman employees tell Tech in Asia that they remain skeptical about whether the deal will go through, citing the online lender‚Äôs previous promises, which have not materialized.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it makes sense that due diligence is scheduled for three months. One month should be enough for a company whose main operation ‚Äì [loan] disbursement ‚Äì has stopped since April 2020,‚Äù said an ex-staffer in a WhatsApp group where the letter of commitment was shared. A screenshot of the group chat was provided to Tech in Asia.

UangTeman‚Äôs office in Pakuwon Tower, Jakarta, has been boarded up even though the company‚Äôs furniture remains inside. The sign forbids anyone from opening the seal and asks that inquiries be directed to building management.

Several UangTeman ex-employees have also signed a letter seeking an audience with Bambang Budiawan, OJK‚Äôs head of oversight for non-bank financial institutions, on Friday, January 14, 2022. One source says that should the meeting fall through, some former¬† staffers may consider holding a demonstration at the OJK offices.
Budiawan has not responded to Tech in Asia‚Äòs requests for comment.
The letter comes on the heels of a Change.org petition posted by ex-employees, in which they ask UangTeman to pay for all its obligations. At time of publication, the petition has received over 400 signatures.

728037,2022-01-13T01:55:55,Can India recreate China‚Äôs live commerce magic?,"Delhi-based Dheeraj Juneja has been creating digital content for the past 10 years. He has done it all ‚Äì from hosting teleshopping episodes to creating short videos. Juneja has recently turned to livestreaming on live commerce platform Roposo, selling fashion products of local brands such as The Man Company and Park Avenue.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easy to make a reel for 30 seconds, but when you do a livestream for 30 to 40 minutes, it takes a lot of energy and concentration,‚Äù he says.
Juneja claims that his monthly income has increased by nearly 30% since he started streaming on Roposo in April 2021.
Live commerce, which allows people to shop in real time through video streaming, has opened an additional avenue of livelihood for content creators like Juneja.
In June 2020, India banned¬†Chinese-owned TikTok following an escalation of a border dispute between the two countries.
Since then, dozens of short-video startups in India have surfaced to capture a slice of what used to be TikTok‚Äôs biggest market and capitalize on the country‚Äôs fast-growing video consumption.
A crowded space
India‚Äôs live commerce sector is expected to generate US$4 billion to US$5 billion in gross merchandise value (GMV) by 2025, with live video apps taking up a slightly larger share compared to general ecommerce marketplaces that adopt live commerce capabilities, according to RedSeer Consulting.
China‚Äôs billion-dollar live commerce sector was built upon the rise of content creators and short-form video consumption. India is witnessing a similar pattern, RedSeer‚Äôs research shows, and the country‚Äôs influencers are also spotting the opportunity to generate sales from content.
According to a Bain &amp; Company report, India‚Äôs online video user base has scaled to more than 350 million people, growing at 24% annually from 2018 to 2020 ‚Äî twice as fast as the equivalent numbers in China and Indonesia.

The nationwide lockdown and additional restrictions amid the pandemic have popularized online shopping in India. As a result, a bunch of short-video and social commerce startups have either rolled out their own livestreaming feature or partnered with ecommerce giants to launch them.
‚ÄúAs companies try to make online commerce reach into the smaller cities of India, they realize that the traditional ecommerce model may not work, and they need to have a video interface. This seems to be the right time to draw upon video commerce to reach the next 300 million to 400 million new ecommerce users,‚Äù Mrigank Gutgutia, associate partner at RedSeer, tells Tech in Asia.


Filling the gap in lower-tier cities
India currently has nearly 700 million internet users, but only about 100 million shop online, Pulkit Agrawal, co-founder and CEO of social commerce platform Trell, tells Tech in Asia.
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a huge need to spread awareness and build trust among non-English-speaking users to make them comfortable with the online paradigms of ecommerce and eventually enabling them to transact,‚Äù says Agrawal.
Trell, which has raised about US$62 million in funding, allows users to create three- to five-minute videos in their native languages. According to Agrawal, the lifestyle video platform is seeing 30% growth in its user base per month, with an annual GMV target of US$1 billion in the next 12 to 18 months.
The CEO says personal care and fashion products see the highest traction on Trell, as buying decisions in these categories are often impulsive. The company is planning to launch live commerce in these categories on its platform this year.

For Lalitha Ramani, chief product officer and senior vice president at Myntra, live shopping will ‚Äúdemocratize‚Äù the personal care and fashion categories, particularly as the company goes deeper into the country‚Äôs Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. Myntra, which is owned by Indian ecommerce giant Flipkart, aims to churn out close to 1,000 hours of live video content per month this year.
Last November, the company unveiled its live commerce offering, M-Live. Videos on the platform will have a section at the bottom where the goods being showcased by the influencer will be displayed. The customer can then click on a product to get more information about it.
According to experts, first-time online shoppers are often overwhelmed by the sheer number of product options in each category on a shopping platform.
For example, there are over 6,500 options for women‚Äôs black shirts on the Myntra app. Influencers, through live commerce, can help customers curate the best pick. Not only does this nudge a user‚Äôs purchase decision forward, it also gives them other insightful tips and information.
‚Äú[Live commerce] will have a greater impact on teaching customers on how to apply makeup, how a dress fits, how to maintain a dress etc.,‚Äù says Ramani.
Another popular social networking startup in the country is ShareChat, which is valued at about US$3.7 billion and serves about 180 million active users in 15 different local languages.
ShareChat‚Äôs short-video platform Moj sealed a partnership with Flipkart in October last year, allowing Moj users to shop directly on the ecommerce platform. The partnership is expected to help Flipkart leverage Moj‚Äôs users in smaller cities as well.

Amazon, Flipkart‚Äôs arch rival, is not sitting on the sidelines either. It worked with livestreaming influencers during last year‚Äôs flagship sales events and has more plans to leverage the content format this year, according to a spokesperson for Amazon India.
But it‚Äôs not all rosy
Despite the upswing in the local live commerce scene, hurdles remain.
Previously, pure-play live commerce startups in the country such as Bulbul and Simsim tried cracking the sector.¬†While Simsim was acquired by YouTube in July 2021, Bulbul shut down its live commerce feature in 2020.
For live commerce to work, platforms need a wide range of content, amazing influencers, and tons of money to scale, points out Bulbul founder Sachin Bhatia.
‚ÄúTo be honest, we were not able to scale up the way we would have liked to,‚Äù he told Tech in Asia.
In hindsight, Bhatia says Bulbul should have focused on one category first instead of dabbling in several sections like apparels, gadgets, and kitchen items.
Another insight the founder learned: Most shoppers engage with live videos but then go back to watch pre-recorded content, recheck product details, and consult family members before making their final purchasing decision.
For local players who dabble in live commerce, where it is widely believed that customer decision journeys are accelerated, this could be something to mull over.
In addition, not all influencers or content creators can sell effectively. According to industry players, making content for entertainment vs. live commerce is different: In the latter scenario, influencers need to have marketing chops to push products for sale.
Roposo, for its part, is running training sessions for nearly 500 live commerce influencers, bringing on experts from China to help groom the potential stars.
See also: How big will livestreaming ecommerce get in Southeast Asia?
‚ÄúThe top 100 livestreamers will be able to drive 80% of a company‚Äôs GMV. So our focus is to identify those livestreamers and work closely with them,‚Äù Mansi Jain, general manager and vice president of Roposo, told Tech in Asia.
The company is also roping in makeup artists, fitness coaches, and fashion stylists to act as influencers, as these experts can break down the quality of the products they‚Äôre using in detail. ‚ÄúWe have also onboarded nearly 60 radio jockeys who are excellent in real-time engagement with the consumers,‚Äù Jain added.
In order to tackle live commerce effectively, platforms must also solve problems unique to the space. The Myntra team, for instance, took months to develop its in-house technology that focuses on color accuracy and other factors like end-to-end streaming latency.
Color accuracy is extremely important when selling fashion products, for example. A crimson-colored item cannot appear as burgundy red, as it would fail the buyer‚Äôs expectations. End-to-end latency ‚Äì the time between when an action happens and when the audience sees it ‚Äì is similarly crucial. If a customer asks a question and the influencer is not able to address it immediately, the ‚Äúlive‚Äù aspect of the episode is lost.
Still, great content alone won‚Äôt be enough. Ecommerce platforms which have a strong logistics chain, might have a competitive edge over pure-play video content players because they can handle the entire customer journey.
That said, Roposo is putting the missing pieces together by making important acquisitions. Its parent firm, Glance, acquired full-stack ecommerce platform Shop101 in June 2021.

‚ÄúWe feel that traditional ecommerce has been very functional and sort of boring,‚Äù Piyush Shah, co-founder at Inmobi Group and COO of Glance, told India‚Äôs Economic Times then. Live commerce, he said, is ‚Äúmuch more fun, more authentic, and more entertaining.‚Äù
Searching for the winning formula
Similar to China, India‚Äôs strong celebrity culture can amplify live shopping in the country. The upcoming rollout of 5G technology in India this year is also expected to boost the sector. Faster internet connections enable users to have better live content experience and take the leap to become frequent shoppers.
For now, it‚Äôs too early to say who will win the race between India‚Äôs specialized short-video platforms or general ecommerce marketplaces.
Besides producing engaging and entertaining experiences, companies are even investing in private labels to make the live experience feel more exclusive.

Hello reader,
I have been lucky enough to spend most of my life near the sea. Coastal folk across the globe will probably tell you that there is a certain alluring charm about the beach, and they‚Äôre not wrong. In the city of Chennai, the friendly yet sprawling fishing community has been a big part of that charm.
Living in the capital of Tamil Nadu and one of India‚Äôs busiest coastal cities, it is almost impossible not to get entwined with the marine fishers. Slightly over a million of them ply their trade across the state‚Äôs 1,000-kilometer coastline.
However, due to a lack of feasible alternatives, they deploy outdated ‚Äì and in some places illegal ‚Äì fishing methods like bottom trawling. This practice destroys the natural seafloor habitat by essentially rototilling the seabed, causing irreparable damage to the marine ecology.
The scenario above is screaming for technological intervention, and aquaculture may just provide the right solution. Today, we take a deep dive into Indonesia-based eFishery‚Äôs massive funding round and its ambitions of international expansion, with its eyes firmly set on India and other Southeast Asian markets.
Today we look at,

The funding round of the lone behemoth of Indonesia‚Äôs aquaculture sector

Making a splash

Image credit: Timmy Loen

Indonesia-based eFishery has just landed the largest-ever VC financing for an aquaculture startup globally. It raised US$90 million in a series C round co-led by Temasek Holdings, SoftBank Vision Fund 2, and Sequoia Capital India.
However, with a business model that has achieved positive EBITDA since 2020 and three key revenue drivers, eFishery is primed to make a splash as it eyes entry into other Southeast Asian markets.


Two fish, one hook: Profitability did not come at the expense of topline growth for eFishery. The company says it has scaled its network tenfold since its last funding round in 2020, and the number of farmers in its ecosystem has increased by 1,248% over the past year.


All alone: Among the main contributing factors to eFishery‚Äôs growth is its almost zero competition in Indonesia‚Äôs aquaculture space. This is surprising, considering the enormous opportunity that the industry holds ‚Äì the country taps into only 8% of its aquaculture potential. When asked why he thinks no other startup has shown interest in the field, eFishery co-founder and CEO Gibran Huzaifah quips that it is a ‚Äúhard sector that requires hard solutions and hard work.‚Äù


A matter of time: Due to its position as the Indonesian market leader, as well as its impressive top and bottom line, eFishery has attracted questions about a potential IPO. Huzaifah told Tech in Asia that going public is a matter of ‚Äúwhen, not if,‚Äù but he stressed that the company‚Äôs current focus is to continue to grow its business.

Not immune to funding

MeMed has bagged US$93 million from new and existing investors, including Horizons Ventures, Shavit Capital, and Social Capital, in a new financing round.
The Israel-based biotech firm developed a COVID-19 Severity Test, which is cleared for use in Europe. The company says that the test can provide an early indication of deterioration and predict further disease progression and recovery.


Cracking the body‚Äôs algorithm: MeMed‚Äôs tech suite decodes the body‚Äôs immune response and provides physicians with patient management solutions that tackle key clinical dilemmas. Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration greenlit the MeMed BV test to be used by healthcare providers for distinguishing between bacterial and viral infections in children and adults.


Riding the wave: The capital raise comes amid heightened interest in Israel‚Äôs deeptech and AI spaces. Israeli companies in the digital health sector raised nearly US$700 million in the first quarter of 2021 ‚Äì almost matching the amount raised by startups in the field throughout the whole of 2020.


Immuno-focused: MeMed has raised over US$200 million to date. The latest investment will be used to scale up manufacturing, accelerate commercialization, and expand its product portfolio centered around the body‚Äôs immune response.

Founded in 2019 by Richard Chua and Claudia Kolonas, Pluang allows users to buy various asset classes, including gold, cryptocurrencies, mutual funds, and index futures of US stocks. It currently has more than four million registered users in Indonesia, and it experienced a 22x growth in monthly transacting users between January 2020 and November 2021.
With the fresh funds, the investment app plans to continue building its technology and expanding its offerings to more asset classes, such as Indonesian stocks and more global equities. It also intends to expand its services to other Southeast Asian countries in the near future.
However, Pluang did not disclose the first target of its expansion plans, and it did not specify whether it will enter the new country by itself or through partnerships with local financial institutions. Instead, the company told Tech in Asia that it believes in ‚Äúthe power of partnerships and relationships.‚Äù
‚ÄúThis is what made us very different from competitors, as we owe a lot of our success to our incredible super-app partners such as Gojek, Tokopedia, Bukalapak and Dana,‚Äù Pluang said in a statement.

Delivered every Wednesday via email and through the Tech in Asia website, this free newsletter breaks down the biggest stories and trends in fintech. If you‚Äôre not a subscriber, get access by registering here.
Hello there,
Hope you‚Äôre doing well as another wave of Covid-19 spreads across the world.
While I was doing some research on the buy now, pay later segment in India late last year, I found that people here were even ordering food online and buying market shares using BNPL products.
The data was astonishing: In the next four years, BNPL is expected to be a US$50 billion market in India compared to only US$3.5 billion now.
That‚Äôs why our fintech Big Story this week caught my attention. My colleague Melissa talks about how the impossible-to-ignore BNPL trend, which hit a record high in Australia in early 2021, is now seeing signs of waning in the country. The Land Down Under is one of the most mature BNPL markets in the world, with several listed players such as Afterpay, Zip, Splitit, Openpay, and Fatfish Group.
So is this the end of pure BNPL? Much like in India, BNPL is in its infancy stage in Southeast Asia, and it may go the way of Australia. But can BNPL players in the region avoid this downward trend? To find answers to these questions and more, read on.

THE BIG STORYBNPL sours in Australia, but will SEA players buck the trend?

Australian BNPL stocks have gone into a tailspin since February 2021 as the model‚Äôs defensibility, rising competition, and regulatory risks are called into question.

THE HOT TAKESingapore fintech firm iFast finally buys a bank
Here‚Äôs what happened:

The Singapore Exchange-listed fintech firm intends to acquire 85% of BFC Bank, a full licensed UK bank.
The acquisition is driven by a belief that banks operate at the ‚Äúfoundation layer‚Äù of the financial industry, and having direct access to this will allow iFast to innovate at a faster pace.
The S$73 million deal values loss-making BFC at an above-average multiple.

Here‚Äôs our take:
The planned acquisition of an 85% stake in BFC may have come a little late for Christmas, but is certainly a present that iFast has long coveted.
Having applied for ‚Äì and failing to receive ‚Äì a digital banking license in Hong Kong and Singapore, iFast‚Äôs prospects in Malaysia are uncertain. The company is one of at least 29 applicants chasing five licenses there.
Why is iFast so keen on having a digital bank?
The company, which started life as an online distributor of unit trusts, now owns businesses spanning the B2B, B2C, and B2B2C segments in financial services.

Lim Chung Chun, iFast‚Äôs founder and CEO, thinks that the fintech sector will become more globalized over time. As such, a digital bank would improve the company‚Äôs ability to build a cross-border wealth management business.
With the acquisition of BFC, Lim is putting his money where his mouth is.
However, the deal values BFC at a price to-book multiple of 1.6x. This is higher than the average for UK banks, which is around 0.7x. Moreover, BFC is not profitable ‚Äì it lost S$4 million in the first nine months of 2021.
The market‚Äôs initial response was skeptical, with iFast‚Äôs shares falling by 4% after the deal was announced and the trading halt was lifted on January 7.
Perhaps investors were unsure of how a UK-licensed bank fits with iFast‚Äôs current business, which is solely Asia-focused. Unlike other sectors, banking remains a country-specific industry, with regulators jealously protecting their turf. For example, while BFC is licensed by the UK authorities, the bank cannot simply offer its services to customers in Malaysia.
IFast may be hoping that this acquisition will give it experience owning and operating a bank, which will boost the company‚Äôs credibility with regulators in other markets it hopes to enter.
Still, one wonders why it didn‚Äôt follow other regional tech players with digital bank aspirations like Sea Group and Grab, which both have acquired a bank in Indonesia instead. IFast may be more comfortable operating a bank in a developed market like the UK, despite its geographic distance from Singapore.
While many are excited by the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi), the scramble to build digital banking businesses shows that tech players still believe in the potential of regulated banks, which act as a trusted centralized provider of financial services.

BNPL firms found their spots alongside Visa and Mastercard at checkout counters as consumers lapped up the service‚Äôs easy and near-instant approvals. Venture capital firms poured fuel into the trend.

Photo credit: piter2121 / 123RF

Across the Indian Ocean, the sentiments toward BNPL have grown more somber.
In February 2021, the service hit a fever pitch in Australia, one of the most mature BNPL markets worldwide. The country has more publicly listed BNPL firms than anywhere else in the world.
Ecommerce was thriving as the Covid-19 pandemic accelerated a shift toward online shopping, providing a ‚Äúone-off big lift‚Äù to BNPL firms, Pranav Gundlapalle, an analyst at Sanford C Bernstein covering Pan-Asian banks and fintech firms, tells Tech in Asia.
Generous stimulus packages dished out to households in the US, the largest market of Australia‚Äôs leading BNPL firm Afterpay, helped fan the flames.
The exuberance has been short-lived. Less than a year on, confidence in Australian BNPL firms is waning ‚Äì if share prices are any indication ‚Äì and prices may have yet hit bottom.

Share prices of Fatfish Group, IOUPay, Sezzle, Openpay, Zip, and Splitit have fallen since their highs in February 2021. / Image credit: Timmy Loen

The decline has been swift. Since their February highs, shares in Afterpay and its rivals ‚Äì including Zip, Splitit, Openpay, and Fatfish Group ‚Äì have lost between 50% and 90% of their value on the public market.
This is partly driven by concerns about the model‚Äôs defensibility amid high competition and fears that last year‚Äôs ecommerce boom may not be sustained.
And with BNPL firms facing more scrutiny from regulators worldwide, Gundlapalle expects downward pressures to persist, especially for standalone players that offer a single product.
‚ÄúI would say you don‚Äôt have a lot of positive catalysts for this space in the medium term,‚Äù he warns.
See also: Southeast Asia‚Äôs biggest buy now, pay later players (update)
In Southeast Asia, BNPL is still in its infancy, with the trend gaining significant momentum only in the past year. The trend playing out in Australia threatens to stall growth for young players in the region, many of whom are starting to feel the impact of heightened competition despite an increase in customer adoption.
A crowded market
As the BNPL movement gained steam worldwide, firms flooded the market with almost identical offerings.
A turning point came when large tech incumbents joined the fray in the third quarter of 2021. Apple and PayPal signaled their entry into the market, while Block (previously Square) acquired Afterpay, making it clear that ‚ÄúBNPL would become more of a feature and less of a product in itself,‚Äù Gundlapalle notes.

Photo credit: nikom1234 / 123RF

This put standalone BNPL firms in an ‚Äúodd‚Äù position where they just have one feature compared to larger competitors, he adds.
Much of the BNPL model rests on charging merchants a premium over alternative payment methods for its superior conversion rates, larger basket sizes, and higher overall customer lifetime values. These fees drive the bulk of earnings for BNPL firms, since most players in developed markets do not charge customers any late fees.
Without a moat, a firm like Afterpay could see its profit margins erode in the long run, as merchants seek out cheaper alternatives ‚Äì a dime or a dozen in the current climate.
Afterpay‚Äôs net transaction margins (NTM) ‚Äì the operating profit margin on each transaction ‚Äì are already decreasing. In the 12 months ending June 30, 2021, the firm‚Äôs NTM was 2%, down from 2.4% in the second half of 2020.

That said, potential synergies following Block‚Äôs acquisition of Afterpay, including the latter‚Äôs integration with the former‚Äôs mobile payments app Cash, could cushion the decline in NTM and open up new revenue streams.
While not all ‚Äúpure-play‚Äù firms will see an acquisition, players with a strong local presence can remain attractive buyout targets for larger BNPL companies looking to expand fast.
It‚Äôs also worth noting that the BNPL firms‚Äô margins are declining despite the strong growth these companies are seeing across the board.


Zip, which operates in the US as QuadPay, saw costs balloon in its 2021 financial year, even as it more than tripled its active customer base to 7.3 million. Afterpay also signed up six million new customers in the same period, bringing its total active customer base to 16 million.


‚ÄúLower gross profit margins as well as higher-than-expected credit loss provisions and net bad debts‚Äù contributed to the poor result, Citi analysts wrote in a note following Zip‚Äôs earnings release.
Increased regulatory scrutiny has also dampened BNPL stocks, particularly in developed markets.
Last October, the Reserve Bank of Australia told BNPL firms that they can no longer stop merchants from passing on the cost of BNPL services to their customers. The move levels the playing field between more costly BNPL services and credit cards, removing a key advantage for players in the country.
Two months later, the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau launched a probe on BNPL firms over concerns that consumers might be rapidly accumulating debt through BNPL plans. The probe also investigated the companies‚Äô use of consumer data, as well as how sufficient their disclosures are, among others. The move sent BNPL stocks tumbling.
The end of pure BNPL
‚Äã‚Äã
To survive, BNPL firms will have to introduce new features.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think any of the current valuations would make sense if you assume [BNPL firms] will be doing BNPL only for the rest of their journey. Almost all BNPL players‚Äô valuation today has some element of the assumption that they‚Äôll start doing a much wider set of products,‚Äù Gundlapalle notes.
BNPL pioneer Klarna, for instance, has introduced bank accounts in Germany. The company also offers budgeting tools, and it runs a loyalty program on top of being a shopping app.
In November, Afterpay began taking deposits into savings accounts that are linked to a physical debit card or e-wallet. The firm also provides advertising and analytics services, and it has hinted that it may soon distribute mortgage loans.
This year, Zip is planning to roll out crypto trading in the US and allow merchants to accept payments in Bitcoin.

Last November, Atome CEO David Chen told Tech in Asia that the company was developing new products and features to drive store traffic to its merchants. These include ‚Äúmerchant analytics and smarter merchant dashboards‚Äù that can help drive conversions.
Indonesia-based fintech firm Akulaku, which saw a strong growth in revenue last year due to the pick-up in BNPL, also introduced additional services through its digital banking app Neo+ last year.
While many BNPL firms have launched ecommerce and lead generation features, these alone may not be enough to stave off competition from online marketplaces that are building native BNPL offerings.
‚ÄúAt that point, I don‚Äôt see why somebody would log into [an] Afterpay or Akulaku to check out what to buy, they‚Äôd just go where they usually shop,‚Äù Gundlapalle says.
‚ÄúThe real attraction is in financial services,‚Äù he adds.
Firms in Southeast Asia will evolve differently
As BNPL firms in mature markets grapple with increasing regulation and rising competition, Southeast Asia-based players will face a different set of challenges.
On the one hand, regional BNPL firms have little to worry about a regulatory shake-up, given many of them already operate as consumer lending businesses and hold the requisite payment and banking licenses.
However, the lack of a credit-tested customer base and the concentration of ecommerce in a few major marketplaces in the region could limit the pace of expansion for these BNPL firms.
The US, a significant driver of BNPL sales in the past year, ‚Äúis a large market not just from a population perspective, but also the size of the ecommerce market outside platforms like Amazon and Walmart,‚Äù Gundlapalle notes.
Comparatively, large marketplaces like Shopee, Lazada, and Tokopedia, dominate ecommerce sales in Southeast Asia.

This matters because BNPL platforms that work directly with independent retailers enjoy better take rates than those that go through a marketplace, which might charge a commission.
See also: The dark side of ‚Äòbuy now, pay later‚Äô
That said, without a credit-tested consumer base in low-income markets, rapid expansion might prove costly for BNPL firms if default rates skyrocket.
There‚Äôs also the risk of BNPL firms over-relying on ecommerce platforms. Like Shopee, other marketplaces may eventually launch installment payments of their own.
On the bright side, regional players are gaining interest income as consumers in the region are willing to pay interest on installment payments, given the under-penetration of credit.
Shopee, for instance, charges its Filipino users 1% to 5% and Malaysian users 1.25% in interest per month for its Paylater service. In contrast, vanilla BNPL offerings by Affirm and Afterpay are interest-free.
Another emerging market advantage is cost savings from lower repayment costs ‚Äì the fees incurred by BNPL firms upon collection of subsequent installment payments from customers ‚Äì as e-wallets or interbank networks like India‚Äôs united payments interface are dominant modes of payment.
In developed markets, these fees are the biggest cost for BNPL firms and can add up to ‚Äúalmost 1%‚Äù of a transaction, as customers tend to link BNPL accounts with credit or debit cards, Gundlapalle says.
See also: Visual: The hefty cost of credit card payments
The analyst expects that growth will continue for multiple BNPL players in the region given lower regulatory risk and under penetration. He is optimistic on opportunities in Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam, in that order.
Players here agree that there‚Äôs much more room for growth. While there are a couple of players in Japan, Indonesia, Singapore, and Malaysia, there isn‚Äôt one company that dominates Asia, Turochas Faud, CEO and founder of Singapore-based BNPL firm Pace, told Tech in Asia last November.
Starting with the BNPL service, Pace‚Äôs end goal is to offer ‚Äúfinancing as a service,‚Äù including personal loans to consumers, and potentially invoice financing or supply chain financing to merchants.
‚ÄúIf you ask, ‚ÄòWho‚Äôs the Klarna of Asia?,‚Äô there‚Äôs no one,‚Äù Faud said.

Hello reader,
What are your thoughts on employee stock option plans (ESOPs)? I‚Äôve long concluded that it‚Äôs not something I‚Äôd be keen on. Having liquidity is important to me, and I‚Äôm not sure that I‚Äôd be able to stay at a company long enough to see my stock options vest and be able to cash out, given the uncertainty of the world we live in.
There are many other folks in Southeast Asia who have similar sentiments, which is why ESOPs aren‚Äôt really a thing in the region, despite the growth in its tech and startup scene. Still, ESOPs, when done properly, can help a company attract and retain talent and provide opportunities for employees to reap the rewards of their faith in the firm. That‚Äôs what Circles Life is aiming to do with its own ESOP scheme.
Today we look at,

Circles Life‚Äôs ESOP plan and what makes it different

Taking a closer look at Circles Life‚Äôs ESOP

Image credit: Timmy Loen

ESOPs aren‚Äôt very popular in Southeast Asia. While some founders see them as a way to attract talent, many employees remain skeptical. In Singapore, telco firm Circles Life is shaking up this perception with its ESOP program, which it says is ‚Äúthe most generous in the region.‚Äù


G is for generosity: Circles Life runs its stock buyback program roughly every 18 months, allowing employees to sell vested stocks back to the company at regular intervals. The firm also issues two months‚Äô worth of stock options as part of their basic compensation to employees, regardless of rank or tenure, every 12 months and has a short vesting period of just a year, as compared to three to four years at other companies. It‚Äôs strike price is also near negligible, at around US$1 a share.


Make me a believer: Circles Life says its ESOP is a key aspect of how it attracts talent and turns ‚Äúemployees into believers.‚Äù According to co-founder Rameez Ansar, the firm finances its buyback program with cash on its balance sheet, allowing it to create liquidity for employees ‚Äúfrom a position of strength.‚Äù


On the flip side: However, it‚Äôs hard to tell if Circles Life‚Äôs approach to ESOPs is all that effective. Some feel that the firm‚Äôs short vesting period may keep it from achieving its goal of retaining talent, while others say that its founders need to be sure that they‚Äôre using their cash for the best purposes.

Payments is a big part of the digital economy, so it‚Äôs no surprise that Vietnam-based payments major MoMo bought shares in Nhanh, a provider of sales management software products.


Established in 2014, Nhanh specializes in cloud-based solutions for omnichannel sales management. This includes online sales, website design, and features that link sellers to logistics providers and add ecommerce integration for platforms such as Lazada, Tiki, and Facebook.


This acquisition will help MoMo ‚Äì Vietnam‚Äôs newest unicorn ‚Äì support the digital transformation of small businesses in the country, while helping them access new customers amid the pandemic.


The announcement comes after MoMo raised US$200 million in a series E round led by Japan‚Äôs Mizuho Bank. The round reportedly pushed the startup‚Äôs valuation to over US$2 billion.

727811,2022-01-11T06:00:59,"Indonesia‚Äôs KoinWorks raises $108m from MDI, East Ventures","For KoinWorks, an Indonesian digital lending company, the Covid-19 period has been a pivotal moment that has enabled it to surge forward in the right direction.
‚ÄúAt the beginning of the pandemic, we tried to step back and look into the situation. But we realized that it‚Äôs actually a mistake because our market kept growing amid the outbreak,‚Äù the company‚Äôs co-founder Willy Arifin told Tech in Asia.
KoinWorks‚Äô main borrower are small and medium enterprises (SMEs) who have digital footprints, such as those who own online shops on Tokopedia and Shopee. These business owners¬†have been somewhat shielded from the blow from Covid-induced social restrictions.

KoinWorks co-founders (from left) Willy Arifin and Benedicto Haryono / Photo credit: KoinWorks

In the past 18 months, the number of SMEs that have digital footprints has doubled from around 10 million to 20 million businesses, according to Arifin, who said such a surge usually takes five years in a non-Covid scenario. At the same time, KoinWorks kept its non-performing loan (NPL) ratio under 2%, which is significantly lower than traditional financial institutions.
Amid the pandemic, the company reached US$15 million in loan disbursements per month, and logged positive cash flow, Arifin said. The firm also hit 1.5 million users at the end of last year.
The company raised a US$108 million in a series C funding round led by MDI Ventures, which is Telkom Group‚Äôs venture arm. Existing investors such as Quona Capital, Triodos Investment Management, Saison Capital, AC Ventures, and East Ventures also took part in the round.
The investment comprised US$43 million in equity and US$65 million in debt capital. Since its establishment, the company has raised US$70 million in equity and around US$110 million in debt.
KoinWorks plans to use the fresh funding to double its existing workforce of 400 employees, who hail from Indonesia, Singapore, Vietnam, and India. The company also aims to triple its revenue and double the number of its users before the end of 2022.
Evolution into a full-fledged financial service for SMEs
Since being founded in 2016, KoinWorks has expanded from being a platform dedicated to peer-to-peer lending to launching several new features to expand its user base.
Arifin said the firm realized that it should do more to help budding founders from the start of their entrepreneurship journey after having to reject many entrepreneurs looking for loans from its lending platform.
That‚Äôs why KoinWorks launched a neobank feature that allows users to open business bank accounts directly from its app. It also gave them learning material on how to manage an online business, promote it, and communicate with customers.
When the company is comfortable with a business owner‚Äôs transaction history, it gives them the KoinWorks Neo Card, a Mastercard virtual card that can be used to do any kind of online payments. Further, the SME can also borrow money through KoinWorks‚Äô lending platform.
The Jakarta-based fintech firm has also introduced an earned-wage access (EWA) service called KoinGaji and a gold investment feature called KoinGold.

KoinWorks‚Äô took an unusual route for fintech firms by starting with a lending business ‚Äì the holy grail of the financial sector due to its high take rate ‚Äì and then expanding into other services. Arifin said it was a natural evolution as most borrowers get their first productive loan from KoinWorks.
No plan to go abroad
Arifin said KoinWorks has shown positive cash flow, especially in its lending business. However, the company has reinvested the surplus to build other features and keep growing its market share.
The co-founder also isn‚Äôt shy about his interest in going public. Without going into specifics, he said an IPO ‚Äì whether in the US via a SPAC merger, or a direct listing on the Indonesian stock exchange ‚Äì was still on the cards. He said the listing wouldn‚Äôt be ‚Äútoo far away.‚Äù
However, Arifin underlined that he still wants to focus on the firm‚Äôs home market and has no plans to expand Koinworks‚Äô lending business to other countries despite having developers from outside Indonesia.

727912,2022-01-11T02:00:09,"Exclusive: Indonesia‚Äôs eFishery nets $90m series C from Temasek, SoftBank, Sequoia","Indonesian startup eFishery has raised a series C funding round of US$90 million, which marks the largest-ever VC financing for an aquaculture startup globally.
The round, which is also the biggest for a Southeast Asian agritech startup, was co-led by Temasek Holdings, SoftBank Vision Fund 2, and Sequoia Capital India. Existing investors including Go-Ventures, The Northstar Group, Wavemaker Partners, and Aqua-Spark also participated in the round.
In an exclusive interview with Tech in Asia, eFishery co-founder and CEO Gibran Huzaifah said that the proceeds will be used to strengthen the company‚Äôs existing ecosystem as it aims to become a ‚Äúdigital cooperative‚Äù for fish farmers.

Gibran Huzaifah, CEO and Co-founder of eFishery / Photo credit: eFishery

‚ÄúWe want to have 1 million fish farmers as members of the cooperative by 2025,‚Äù he shares. The company currently has 30,000 fish farmers on its platform.
The fresh capital will go towards eFishery‚Äôs international expansion plans, having piloted the project for a couple of years. The company expects to have a commercial presence in as many as 10 different countries by 2025.
Founded in 2013 in the city of Bandung, the startup entered the market with an IoT device called eFishery Feeder, which enables automated feeding in fish and shrimp farms. Farmers can then monitor and schedule¬† feeding via a smartphone app. The device also collects data on farm production patterns and fish behavior.
Having access to this valuable data has helped eFishery create a host of other solutions. It now makes money from three main revenue sources: the feeder device, which farmers can rent for 5,000 rupiah (about US$0.35) a day; eFishery Mall, a marketplace for selling fish and shrimp feed; and eFishery Fresh, which allows the company to sell fresh fish and shrimp to B2B customers such as restaurants, export buyers, and wholesale traders.
The company‚Äôs business model serves a vast market: Indonesia‚Äôs aquaculture production volume reached 15.1 million metric tons in 2019. EFishery says it has achieved positive EBITDA since 2020.
Unchallenged growth
Interestingly, profitability did not come at the expense of topline growth for eFishery. The company says it has scaled its network tenfold since its last funding round in 2020, and the number of farmers in its ecosystem has increased 1,248% over the last year.
Among the main contributing factors is its almost zero competition in Indonesia‚Äôs aquaculture space. This is surprising, considering the enormous opportunity that the industry holds. The country taps into only 8% of its aquaculture potential.
While other startups in the maritime and fisheries industry exist ‚Äì like East Ventures-backed Aruna, for example ‚Äì none of them provide aquaculture-focused solutions.
When asked why he thinks no other startup has shown interest in the field, the CEO quips that it is a ‚Äúhard sector that requires hard solutions and hard work.‚Äù

He adds that any new player would quickly realize that cracking the aquaculture game demands considerable effort and time, as fish farming is a segment that is almost impossible to growth-hack.
‚ÄúI remember the time when we offered our equipment for free to farmers but they turned it down. We even paid them to use it, but they still turned it down. So the only way is to come and use a personal approach,‚Äù Huzaifah says.
However, it is inevitable that competition will come sooner or later, according to Ivan Arie Sustiawan, managing partner at VC firm Tunnelerate.
Sustiawan, whose firm also evaluates early-stage agritech startups for potential investment, observes that ‚Äúnew tech-based aquaculture players are coming to this space to fill the gap or challenge existing prominent players.‚Äù
For the moment, though, eFishery‚Äôs main rival will likely come in the form of local and/or traditional middlemen. Such players are bound to resist anyone that disrupts their captive market, says Sustiawan, who is also a co-founder and former CEO of agritech company Tanihub.
This is a hurdle that eFishery‚Äôs Huzaifah acknowledges, describing it as a ‚Äúpotential barrier‚Äù in his company‚Äôs efforts to onboard significantly more farmers. But Sustiawan points out that there can be smart ways of navigating through such barriers.
‚ÄúThis can be managed by embracing and collaborating with [middlemen] for certain cultivation and development projects,‚Äù he says.
Big fish in more ponds
Due to its position as the Indonesian market leader, as well as its impressive top and bottom line, eFishery has understandably attracted questions about a potential IPO.
Huzaifah told Tech in Asia that going public is a matter of ‚Äúwhen, not if,‚Äù but he stressed that eFishery‚Äôs current focus is to continue to grow its business.
One area of growth is its planned geographical expansion, which is likely to boost the company‚Äôs market value once the public listing comes around.

Going from zero to its target of 10 countries within just three years is ambitious, to say the least. That said, Huzaifah believes that eFishery has onboarded the perfect partners in its new round to make this a reality.
Prolific global investors like Temasek, SoftBank, and Sequoia can use their connections to help the startup roll out its operations in different markets. For instance, Thailand has been a long-term expansion target for eFishery. It expects to finally set up an operation in the country within months through a joint venture with a local firm.
Next in line are Vietnam, China, and India, where eFishery has had early discussions with potential local partners.
‚ÄúBuilding a localized solution will be a key ingredient for success in all markets, especially adapting the technology to varying aquaculture and climate conditions as well as tailoring the go-to-market approach in each region,‚Äù says Johan Surani, vice president at Sequoia India.
Huzaifah claims that eFishery has become the biggest aquaculture tech startup in the world, and he is confident that his company can replicate its success in other markets.
‚ÄúWe already have an end-to-end model and our products/services have passed the development phase,‚Äù he contends. ‚ÄúWith the right operating model and partner, we believe we can scale more quickly in a new country and get positive unit economics from day one.‚Äù",Ardi Wirdana,Putra Muskita and Eileen C.

Kotak Mahindra Bank, one of India‚Äôs largest private lenders, is planning to take legal action against him and his wife, Madhuri, who is also BharatPe‚Äôs head of controls.
BharatPe told Tech in Asia that it did not have anything to comment on the matter.
The dispute concerns the bank allegedly failing to get the couple shares of FSN E-Commerce Ventures, the parent company of cosmetics retailer Nykaa, after its listing in November. The shares were worth over US$67 million.
Following this, the Grovers reportedly issued a legal notice to Kotak Mahindra Bank in which their lawyer alleged that despite repeated assurances by the lender that shares of FSN would be allotted to the couple, Kotak was unable to meet the request.
The issue took a murky turn after an anonymous Twitter handle, BabuBongo, shared an audio clip in which a person, allegedly Ashneer Grover, could be heard hurling abuses against a Kotak bank manager and giving him death threats for failing to deliver the FSN shares to him and his wife.

The deleted tweet by anonymous user BabuBongo / Source: Twitter

The audio clip went viral on social media, furthering a conversation on the toxicity of startup culture.
Grover then tweeted saying that the audio clip was fake, adding that it was a scamster trying to extort funds from him in bitcoin. Later, both the BabuBongo audio clip and Grover‚Äôs tweet were deleted.
However, Kotak Mahindra Bank stated that it has placed on record ‚Äúour objections to inappropriate language used by Mr. Grover. We would like to confirm that there is no breach or violation by the Kotak Group in any manner whatsoever.‚Äù
‚ÄúAppropriate legal action is being pursued,‚Äù the bank added.

BharatPe has received over US$700 million in funding from a slew of marquee investors including Tiger Global, Beenext, Sequoia Capital India, and Alteria Capital.
There have been tweets doing the rounds that Tiger Global and Beenext have sought an emergency meeting with the company after the dispute came to light. Tech in Asia could not verify the authenticity of the tweets.

Hello reader,
The importance of financial inclusion to a country is often overlooked. It helps build the key concepts of credit and savings and is a major step toward inclusive growth, i.e., growing financially stable together as a population, irrespective of age, gender, race or income.
Financial inclusion is a major issue that needs to be addressed, especially among countries in Southeast Asia. For example, a staggering 47% of the Philippines‚Äô adult population are unbanked as of the second quarter of 2021. Yet, the topic, like most things related to banking or finance (ahem, taxes), is often met with an eye roll.
The advances in fintech and digital transactions are, nonetheless, painting a brighter picture for financial inclusion in Southeast Asia. More and more startups are making financial services easily accessible. Today, we analyze how the Philippines‚Äô digibanks are accelerating financial inclusion in the country.
Today we look at,

A digibank revolution awaits

Image credit: Timmy Loen

With a plethora of documents required, long queues, and a barrage of financial jargon to face, there are very few things I hate more than visiting my bank. Regardless of its importance, bank visits are cumbersome. Luckily, I haven‚Äôt visited one in a long time.
While that is partly due to the pandemic, it is mainly down to me changing the way I transact. I count on digital banking and fintech apps for payments, investments, and other daily transactions. As digital transactions slowly spread its roots across the Philippines ‚Äì thanks to a new group of digibanks ‚Äì I cannot wait to see its citizens join me on the bandwagon.


It‚Äôs a team sport: Digital bank executives point to the current state of internet connectivity in the Philippines, which has an internet penetration rate of 67%, as a roadblock to the industry‚Äôs development. ‚ÄúTelcos also have to up their game and build the infrastructure to make it possible for digital to play in those far-off places,‚Äù says Albert Tinio, chief commercial officer and co-founder of digital bank GoTyme.


The chosen ones: In October 2021, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), the country‚Äôs central bank, issued digital bank licenses to only six players ‚Äì GoTyme, Maya Bank, Tonik, Overseas Filipino Bank, Union Digital Bank, and UNObank. Nine other applicants for the license were not approved, as ‚Äúthey had not completed the requirements in time,‚Äù according to a BSP statement.


The more the merrier: Players in the space feel there is a need for more digital bank operators in the Philippines. It is a ‚Äúmisnomer to say it is crowded,‚Äù Jojo Malolos, president and CEO of GoTyme, tells Tech in Asia. Similarly, Tonik Bank CEO Greg Krasnov believes that having more digibank players will help to accelerate financial inclusion in the country.

It has bagged a whopping US$240 million in its financing round led by Reliance Retail Ventures, with participation from existing investors Lightbox, Lightrock, 3L Capital, and Alteria Capital.


A sizable chunk: With an investment of US$200 million, Reliance Retail owns a 25.8% stake in Dunzo on a fully diluted basis.


Broadening horizons: The fresh capital will be used to help Dunzo enable instant delivery of essentials from a network of microwarehouses. The company also seeks to expand its B2B business vertical to enable logistics for local merchants in Indian cities.


Hand in hand: Dunzo and Reliance Retail will enter into certain business partnerships, where the former will enable hyperlocal logistics for the retail stores operated by the latter. Dunzo will also facilitate last-mile deliveries for the merchant network of JioMart, a unit under Reliance Retail.

I‚Äôve seen the damage that bad leaders can do, as well as the incredible positive impact that good ones can have. The best leaders can guide others through both big and small actions ‚Äì not only do they inspire others with rhetoric, but they also lead by example and instruction.
The current business landscape is as uncertain as ever, which makes strong leadership even more vital. Courses like the ESSEC &amp; Mannheim Executive MBA Asia-Pacific program can help leaders strengthen the skills they need to work through difficult situations.

727373,2022-01-10T09:30:00,How NFTs are building communities online,"My biggest takeaway after falling into the NFT rabbit hole is learning about the technology‚Äôs long-term potential as a community-building tool.
One of the most challenging parts of any virtual ecosystem is scaling authenticity, but NFTs are changing this. These are some of the interesting ways I‚Äôve seen NFTs used in community building and how they might evolve over time.
Exclusivity: airdrops or early access for new releases
One of the clearest benefits of holding an NFT is having early or exclusive access to future releases from your favorite brands and creators. This could be in the form of a free NFT from a future release by a brand whose NFT you already hold.
Alternatively, some creators give those who already hold their NFTs early access to succeeding launches. This type of exclusivity becomes valuable if the demand for the drop is greater than the supply.
A subsequent collection produced by a creator is often a large milestone in the community, generating a lot of engagement and excitement in the lead-up to the drop. For brands with a large following, there is generally monetary value for the second set of NFTs they release, which benefits their NFT holders.
A good example of this would be the Robotos project, which had a highly anticipated launch in October last year. Robotos is a collection of droid characters designed by artist Pablo Stanley¬†that are minted as NFTs.
Every single one of the 10,000 robotos are unique and algorithmically generated using more than 170 different hand-drawn traits. Their design ‚Äì coupled with Stanley‚Äôs enthusiastic personality ‚Äì established a vibrant community around the NFTs. It‚Äôs an active group that holds conversations about the direction of the project on platforms like Discord or Twitter Spaces.
Every roboto holder will get a free ‚Äúrobopet companion,‚Äù which has been a much-awaited milestone in the project, and the community has been trying to guess what the robopets look like for weeks. When a sneak peak was finally announced, the artist did not disappoint: Every robopet will inherit one trait from the roboto they are based on, which holders already love.

Robopets from the Robotos project by Pablo Stanley

Physical merchandise is also often exclusively distributed to NFT holders. This is particularly effective for brands that have already created a certain level of exclusivity and loyalty. For a digital-native generation, owning virtual assets and being part of tribes is important, just like owning a recognizable watch or driving a nice car is important for some people.
One recent example would be the Mutant Ape Yacht Club‚Äôs merchandise store that is only available to its NFT holders.

Merchandise that can only be purchased if you hold a Mutant Ape Yacht Club NFT

Voting and governance: shaping the direction of the brand
Different communities are innovating with the participation of its members, and brands are experimenting to see what it would be like to include token holders in decentralized decision-making.
A great example would be the Nouns DAO project. Some of the initiatives that Nouns holders have voted on include creating a Nouns comic, building an iOS and Apple Watch app, and donating ether to charities. All the funds for these initiatives come from the Nouns treasury, which was built through mints (that‚Äôs NFT speak for direct sales) of Nouns NFTs and ongoing royalties from secondary sales.

List of proposals Noun holders can review and vote on

While Nouns is a radical example, there are many other projects that take feedback from their holders. One would be the Sneaky Vampire Syndicate, which announced a collaboration with a high-end sneaker retailer as its first physical brand collaboration.
The news was met with very mixed reactions from the community. Many understood that this was the first in a pipeline of planned partnerships, but a number of holders voiced out that they did not buy into the project thinking it would become a sneaker brand.
In this case, democracy played out in real time: The team reacted quickly and postponed the partnership, focusing on digital utility in the short run.
Internal economy: utility tokens
Utility tokens are used by projects that focus on being usable in the digital world. Often, these tokens are distributed to NFT holders at regular intervals as a reward for holding on to the NFTs. These tokens can also be used for various purchases within the project‚Äôs ecosystem.
‚ÄúBurn mechanisms,‚Äù which remove a certain number of tokens from circulation on a regular basis, ensure the value of the token does not depreciate over time. However, managing supply and demand is a balancing game and requires a team that‚Äôs familiar with ‚Äútokenomics‚Äù to pull off.
A recent project in the space that uses tokenomics ‚Äì the study of the economics of cryptocurrencies ‚Äì is Dojicrew by famed street artist James Ame.

Dojicrew by James Ame

Ame and his team are creating a unique system where each figure is a combination of individual NFTs classified as ‚Äútraits‚Äù that are interchangeable ‚Äì just like a physical lego figure. Each NFT is assigned a rank at random and issued a daily amount of ‚Äúzingots‚Äù depending on its rank. These zingots are utility tokens that can be used to purchase traits from other players or new traits that are released by the artist.
The system creates an internal economy that operates with all the benefits of being digital while mimicking the physical collector space, where participants have full ownership of their unique collection.
Possible evolution of communities
The space is still in its very early days, so it will be interesting to see how community building continues to evolve as NFTs become more pervasive and Web3 sees mainstream adoption. I believe NFT communities will evolve into tribes in the metaverse and will be increasingly used as a proxy for social standing.
Identities and tribes in the metaverse
It is only human nature for communities to form in the Web3 universe. You can change between avatars and belong to multiple communities, but everyone will have one avatar that belongs with a community they feel most at home with.
I believe profile picture NFTs are the first generation of avatars in the metaverse. Different communities are already forming across various NFT projects, mostly existing in siloed Discord servers. These NFTs will evolve into 3D avatars for the metaverse, and the relationships formed in strong communities will outlast the mediums we used to get there.
Social standing as collateral
In the real world, we often assign credibility to someone based on their social standing, more often subconsciously than intentionally. However, intentional efforts to do this do exist, especially in environments where other preferred data points are difficult to verify. One example would be in the microfinance space, where borrowers can secure loans if their peers vouch for their trustworthiness.
In the anonymous online world, it can be hard to find trusted data points. However, individuals can show the NFTs they hold, representing the communities they are in.
If you are an NFT holder in a well-regarded community, you will want to avoid being reproached or removed from that community by misbehaving. That‚Äôs why offering your social standing as collateral is a way to gain some ‚Äì though not absolute ‚Äì trust. However, this will first require the mass market to understand the value of Web3 communities.
I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing new community engagement strategies evolve over time. We live in an increasingly interconnected world, yet we have found authentic community building to be difficult to scale. I believe NFTs are the innovation that can change that.

Hi there,
2021 was a watershed year for climate tech investing ‚Äì more investors were actively involved in the sector, making more deals and pouring in greater amounts of money. It seemed any company that claimed to be tackling the climate crisis instantly became a darling in investors‚Äô eyes.
However, buzzwords like ‚ÄúESG‚Äù are being thrown around a lot because there isn‚Äôt a clear definition of the term.
Did you pay attention to any climate-focused funds last year? What do you think the climate investment landscape will be like this year? I would love to hear your thoughts!

Plastic waste startups are on the rise, but more needs to be done to scale their impact.

DEEP READS
1Ô∏è‚É£ How 2021 became the year of ESG investing
Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) became the new buzzword in investing in 2021. Over the past year, ESG has grown to make up 10% of worldwide fund assets. According to the latest data, money poured into ESG-focused funds hit a record high with US$649 billion (as of November 30), up from US$542 billion in the previous year.
Ostensibly, more money pouring into ESG is a good sign that businesses and financial institutions are embracing sustainable finance. The reality, however, paints a less rosy picture.
For one, the corporate ESG data that are currently available are often incomplete and inconsistent across companies, sectors, and countries. Moreover, asset management firms that compile some of the most popular funds don‚Äôt always agree on what ESG means, resulting in companies that very loosely fit the bill being included in the mix.
A new report found that many of these funds have a carbon footprint not much lower than the S&amp;P 500. At present, the climate performance of a company is often considered of less importance by portfolio managers than, say, its market cap.
This year, ESG investing will likely continue to balloon, but it will also face more scrutiny. Regulators worldwide are putting more pressure on companies to prioritize ESG disclosures. The US Securities and Exchange Commission, for example, has been working on providing more guidance on ESG and carbon emission disclosures. The European Commission has also been firming up its rules on the classifications of climate-friendly activities.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Top equity funds in Asia are all buying China‚Äôs green stocks
Asia‚Äôs top funds are investing in Chinese green stocks, and, crucially, making great returns. According to Bloomberg, the region‚Äôs five best-performing US$1 billion-plus equity funds recorded over 40% returns this year by investing in green sectors. The China AMC Energy Innovation Equity Fund saw total returns of 55%, the highest among the five funds.
Government policy has been fuelling the growth in China‚Äôs green sectors, including renewable energy products and EVs. Last year, Beijing pledged to become carbon neutral by 2060. In its Five Year Plan, released in March, China set an 18% reduction target for carbon dioxide intensity and a 13.5% reduction target for energy intensity from 2021 to 2025.
The support from policy-makers boosted the stocks of companies like those of battery maker Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. (CATL), whose shares soared more than 80% to record highs this year.
In the long term, opportunities abound for China‚Äôs green sector. However, in the short term, it is subjected to a lot of volatility coming from events like the US‚Äôs sanction of Chinese solar panels over the treatment of Uyghur Muslims. China‚Äôs EV and battery makers are also facing increasingly scarce supply of raw materials such as cobalt, graphite, and nickel.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Former Lyft CSO and Freestyle Capital co-founder team up to back climate tech startups
Lyft‚Äôs former chief strategy officer and head of business, Raj Kapoor, and Freestyle Capital co-founder Josh Felser launched an early-stage venture capital firm Climactic. The new company wants to invest exclusively in startups working toward net-zero goals. It has so far backed 11 companies, investing US$50,000 to US$100,000 per deal. The company did not disclose any future fundraising plans.
Why it matters:
Climactic is breaking into the increasingly crowded climate tech investing space. Lowercarbon Capital by billionaire investor Chris Sacca recently raised US$800 million fund in August, and UK-based 2150 VC raised a US$312 million fund in October. Closer to home, Singapore‚Äôs Wavemaker Partners launched a climate tech venture builder in the same month.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Germany approves 900m euros for green hydrogen project
Germany‚Äôs economy ministry announced it would invest US$1 billion into a funding scheme to support green hydrogen.
The new scheme, dubbed H2Global, proposes the use of a ‚Äúdouble auction‚Äù model. It involves buying hydrogen or hydrogen derivatives in non-EU countries at the lowest possible price with 10-year contracts. These contracts are processed through an intermediary established by the private sector. The products are then sold using short-term auctions at the highest possible price to companies within the EU.
Since green hydrogen is still relatively expensive, the intermediary service will likely see losses in the first couple of years. However, the federal grant will offset these losses for a maximum of 10 years. The losses are expected to decrease as the demand for hydrogen rises. The first deliveries of these green hydrogen products to Germany and Europe are slated for 2024.
Why it matters:
Most hydrogen used today comes from natural gas (a fossil fuel), and the process emits large amounts of carbon dioxide. Green hydrogen, on the other hand, is produced from water by electrolysis and emits almost no greenhouse gasses, but it is energy-intensive.
If green hydrogen is going to play a key role in decarbonizing Germany‚Äôs economy, then it means there needs to be a massive acceleration of renewable energy production.

STARTUP WATCH

727588,2022-01-10T05:00:43,Circles Life‚Äôs ESOP breaks new ground. But is there a trade-off?,"When an ex-employee of a rapidly growing Southeast Asian unicorn was about to cash out his stock options, he noticed that the shares had been wiped from the system, even though they were supposed to be valid until 2029.
He later found that the legal fine print said employees had to exercise their options within a year of leaving the company. If not, the options would expire.
The employee claims he had not been adequately briefed about this when he was offboarded and wonders whether others have had the same experience.

As Southeast Asia‚Äôs startup ecosystem grows rapidly and the demand for talent shoots up, founders have turned to employee stock option plans (ESOPs) to attract talent.
Many employees, however, remain skeptical. Indonesia is seen as lacking an ESOP culture despite having the second-highest number of unicorns in the region.
Meanwhile, ex-Grab staff in Vietnam belatedly found out that the shares they held would become worthless when the company went public due to regulations, though the company did try to salvage the situation by buying back their shares.
Founders, too, are unfamiliar with the nuances of ESOPs. Also, 58% of companies that don‚Äôt run these schemes doubt that it‚Äôs the right strategy to attract and keep talent, while 51% are unsure about how to implement it, according to a 2021 study by Svested and Saison Capital entitled ‚ÄúState of ESOPs in Southeast Asia.‚Äù
It‚Äôs a chicken-and-egg problem: If ESOPs are poorly run and illiquid, employees won‚Äôt find them enticing. And if employees aren‚Äôt clamoring for ESOPs, startups won‚Äôt implement them.
Singapore telco Circles Life is hoping to break a vicious cycle by running an ESOP that it says is ‚Äúthe most generous in the region.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not true that people here don‚Äôt value ESOPs. It‚Äôs just that we have to do a better job as a community to help other founders, employees and investors understand how ESOPs are a win-win for everyone,‚Äù says Rameez Ansar, co-founder of Circles Life, in an interview with Tech in Asia.
A key attraction for the firm is its stock buyback program, which happens roughly every 18 months and allows all employees to sell vested stocks back to the company at regular intervals.
The telco‚Äôs most recent buyback program ‚Äì accessible to all employees with over a year‚Äôs tenure ‚Äì was worth $5 million. Circles Life says this was one of the biggest pre-IPO liquidity events in Southeast Asia in recent times.
In the past, startup founders preferred to wait for an exit, such as an IPO or a trade sale, before implementing buyback programs.
However, in today‚Äôs startup scene, where the focus is on talent retention and with more upside from valuation hikes, founders have been issuing buybacks to employees at almost any stage in a company‚Äôs growth.
Younger startups issue ESOPs when they are short on cash, encouraging employees to sacrifice short-term gain for long-term reward. Later, when a company like Circles Life runs at full speed, stock options reward those who have been with the company since its early days.
Circles Life‚Äôs approach isn‚Äôt without detractors ‚Äì some ask if the telco can actually afford to keep up its liberal ESOP scheme, while others wonder if it‚Äôs approach can be replicated by startups with less funding.
An unusual plan
Every 12 months, all full-time Circles Life employees, irrespective of rank or tenure, get two months‚Äô worth of stock options as part of their basic compensation. Employees can encash their shares at a price corresponding to the company‚Äôs latest valuation, rather than a discounted rate or one that‚Äôs tied to a lower valuation from a previous funding round.
The firm‚Äôs most recent buyback program allows employees with tenure of one year to sell up to 50% of fully vested stock options. At Circles Life, the vesting period ‚Äì which is the waiting period before employees can own the shares they‚Äôre eligible for ‚Äì is one year. In other companies, this can typically take three or four years.
‚ÄúSpace Explorers,‚Äù Circles Life‚Äôs top-performing employees, get an additional six months‚Äô worth of stocks that vest immediately and at a low strike price ‚Äì the cost an employee needs to bear to exercise each option.
Circles Life‚Äôs strike price is around US$1, which is negligible. This is in stark contrast to what most founders said in the Svested and Saison Capital study ‚Äì they stressed that strike prices were based on the price per share of their latest funding round. The study adds that high strike prices make it difficult for employees to exercise their stock options, making the ESOPs practically ‚Äúworthless to them.‚Äù
Ansar says that his company‚Äôs investors had a lot of questions about his ESOP proposal, but later came around.
He adds that some investors think employees who have just joined a company should not be entitled to a nominal strike price ‚Äì this effectively translates to getting shares at a discounted price ‚Äì especially since they haven‚Äôt been around since the company‚Äôs early days.
Ansar highlights, however, that ESOPs are a way to turn employees into ‚Äúbelievers.‚Äù
Pearlyn Yeo, senior design manager at Circles Life, compares the ESOP to ‚Äúsavings you never knew you could have till now.‚Äù
Further, Ansar says Circles Life‚Äôs buyback programs are financed by cash on its balance sheet instead of being linked to a funding round, which typically involves new investors buying out existing shareholders. Employees can also buy company stocks from each other through an internal marketplace.
‚ÄúWe believe the right approach for late-stage companies is to set aside at least 3% to 5% of the overall cap table for ESOPs and make it a point to go to investors at least every two years to refresh the pool,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis is what we‚Äôre currently doing.‚Äù
Circles Life says that its ESOP pool makes up 8% of total shares. Meanwhile, mature startups in Singapore typically allocate 3% to over 20% of their cap table to ESOPs, a scan of VentureCap Insights data shows.
That said, ESOP pools between startups may not make for apple-to-apple comparisons. In later-stage startups, some employees would have exercised their shares, which may or may not get taken out of the ESOP pool.
In other instances, founders shares may get included in the ESOP pool too. Also, startups with nominal strike prices won‚Äôt need as large a pool compared to peers that set high strike prices.

If all goes well, Circles Life‚Äôs employees are set to reap handsome rewards. In a December announcement, the firm highlighted that stocks awarded to employees in the company‚Äôs early days had grown over 13x in value, while the business has grown over 50x since launching in 2016.
Ansar estimates that if the company listed on the Nasdaq at a US$30 billion valuation today, the top 25 employees currently with the firm ‚Äì who own the most shares ‚Äì would collectively hold upwards of US$360 million in stock.
‚ÄúThis is our company buying back shares at regular intervals using our own capital and creating liquidity for employees from a position of strength, versus being forced to do so to raise money or as part of a larger fundraise,‚Äù he added.
ESOP boom
After a slowdown in 2020, the number of companies executing buybacks has picked up again. Companies are prioritizing talent retention once more and competing in a tightening job market.
The recent spate of public listings is also playing a role. More employees are now valuing stock options higher and are more willing to bank on them.
See more: Recap: SEA‚Äôs biggest tech listings in 2021
In the table below, Pravin Jadhav, CEO of Dhan, a technology investment platform, outlines key ESOP features and how founders can design and improve their own programs.

While Svested CEO Casper Peh wouldn‚Äôt say Circles Life‚Äôs ESOP is generous, he believes the founders have foresight and are smart for issuing a unique stock options program.
He notes that Circles Life‚Äôs biggest competitors are listed companies and that the ESOP is a way for the firm to stand out as its share price has more upside potential compared with the limited growth prospects of listed companies.
But what‚Äôs the catch?
Stock buybacks and ESOPs can be expensive and are sometimes seen by investors as poor use of company resources.
In the Svested and Saison Capital study, only 18% of founders said investors had asked them to implement ESOPs. Another downside is that stock options become less attractive when the company in question starts to have less upside value and when an employee has to pay taxes on the stock. In Singapore, taxes are levied at the time employees exercise their options.
Buybacks don‚Äôt always make employees feel more secure either. If founders are allowed to exercise their options first (without returning them to the pool), then the concern is that employees may be shortchanged for the benefit of executives or investors.
Further, while Circles Life‚Äôs stock buyback scheme is the first of its kind known to Dan Chong, founder of VC firm Gobi Partners, he wonders whether the ESOP‚Äôs short vesting period may keep it from achieving its goal of retaining talent.
From an investor‚Äôs perspective, Chong says Circles Life‚Äôs founders need to be sure that they are using the company‚Äôs cash wisely for growth.
Looi Qin En, principal of Saison Capital says an ESOP aims to align the incentives of everyone, including founders, employees, and investors.
Looi adds that founders and leaders tend to be hands-on in explaining ESOPs to their employees, helping prevent employees from failing to get the returns they‚Äôre looking for.
Circles Life follows a long line of startups that have rolled out stock option plans ‚Äì a practice that Silicon Valley companies have used since the 1980s.
Ansar says they spent a lot of time looking at Silicon Valley firms like Airbnb and Netflix and the way they integrated ESOPs into the flexible compensation and incentives mix for their employees.
For smaller startups, Ansar points out that ESOPs like Circles Life‚Äôs are feasible even for companies that are just starting.
He has three pointers for such firms: commit to it, start early and include investors in the discussion, and treat it as an important item in the budget. Once a startup has these foundations in place, it must start small, treat its buyback programs like a routine, allocate more money to the ESOP as it grows, and calibrate the company‚Äôs expenses along the way.
‚ÄúI hope one day we‚Äôll succeed in creating our own unique version of ESOPs, with Singapore as the hub for world-class employee ownership practices,‚Äù Ansar adds.",Joana Bagano,Terence Lee and Arpit Nayak,3,"['Premium Content', 'Startups']",True,True,7

Hi readers,
When people reach a certain age, they naturally consider finding the right partner to start a family, especially when invitations to their friends‚Äô wedding begin filling up their mailboxes. But wise parents will always advise their children against rushing it when they‚Äôre not ready.
The decade-old Traveloka was among the first companies in Southeast Asia to begin the conversation around going public through a SPAC merger when the trend was at a fever pitch. However, just months after the unicorn said it would ‚Äúmarry‚Äù Bridgetown, a Hong Kong-based blank-check company, the Indonesian firm pulled the plug on it.
In my recent piece, you‚Äôll find out why Traveloka has made the logical move, considering the circumstances surrounding both the SPAC and Traveloka itself. Scrutiny from the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the quick-deal impulse, and the Covid-19 complications ‚Äì it all pointed toward ‚Äåbad timing.
That said, should every company break off SPAC talks? Well, your friends‚Äô weddings shouldn‚Äôt affect you, and your own doubts shouldn‚Äôt give your friends cold feet. With the right partner, a healthy deal, and a little faith in future success, the SPAC route will remain an accessible option to many.

727661,2022-01-07T11:56:27,Walmart pulled up by police in China over cybersecurity issues,"Shenzhen police pulled up US retail giant Walmart over alleged cybersecurity violations as it found 19 ‚Äúvulnerabilities‚Äù in its system, reported Reuters, citing local media firm China Quality News.
While the local media outlet didn‚Äôt provide details on the retail giants‚Äô violations, the Shenzhen police said that the store was too slow in fixing the cybersecurity gaps.
The development comes after Walmart in China recently saw complaints about its retail arm, Sam‚Äôs Club, after the latter removed products sourced from the Xinjiang region from its shelves. The province continues to be the subject of a tussle between China and the US over human rights issues involving Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities.
As a result, many customers canceled their Sam‚Äôs Club memberships. This comes after the retail arm was slapped with a US$1,568 food safety fine in Shanghai after the city‚Äôs market regulator found a vegetable product with no expiration or production date at one of its branches.

Grab launched its group order feature in September 2020. The service lets consumers save on additional delivery fees by combining several orders together.
Since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, which crumpled sectors such as transportation and travel, Grab‚Äôs delivery business has been its cash cow.

726825,2022-01-07T05:00:07,Banking on a digital remedy in the Philippines,"After finishing her undergraduate degree, Christina Quiambao landed her first job. But to start working as a media writer, she had to sign up for a payroll account with her employer‚Äôs designated bank.
‚ÄúIt took quite some time before [the bank was] able to start with the process‚Ä¶ Eventually, they told me to come back in a week to get the physical card and activate it,‚Äù she tells Tech in Asia.

Image credit: Timmy Loen

While this is a typical requirement for new employees in the Philippines, it has been more than a year since the deadly Covid-19 pandemic forced the country into one of the longest lockdowns in the world. Vaccination drives generally prioritized frontliners and health-compromised individuals, while dose availability was an issue.
‚ÄúI was terrified because I was exposing myself to Covid-19,‚Äù adds Quiambao, who was not yet vaccinated at the time.
The difficulty of opening a bank account is one of the reasons why there are 36.9 million unbanked Filipinos ‚Äì roughly 47% of the country‚Äôs adult population ‚Äì as of the second quarter of 2021.
While 37 banks already incorporated electronic onboarding capabilities as of Q2 2021, some ‚Äì like the one Quiambao had to sign up with ‚Äì still required personal appearances to open an account.
The entry of six digital banks in the Philippines is expected to solve this problem, as well as other issues that users encounter at traditional banks in the country.
The Philippines‚Äô central bank, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), defines a digital bank as an institution offering financial products and services that are ‚Äúprocessed end to end through a digital platform and/or electronic channels with no physical branch/sub-branch or branch-lite unit.‚Äù
But the path for Philippine digibanks may not be a smooth one.
Challenges ahead
Digital bank executives who spoke to Tech in Asia pointed to the current state of internet connectivity in the Philippines as an issue that‚Äôs beyond the control of financial institutions.
Because digibanks don‚Äôt have a physical branch, customers can only connect with them online, making it harder for those outside big cities to access their services.

As of January 2021, the country‚Äôs internet penetration rate was at 67%, and it ranked sixth among 10 ASEAN countries in terms of internet speed. Given these factors, reaching the unbanked becomes a stretch when digital banks need customers to be online in the first place.
‚ÄúTelcos also have to up their game and build the infrastructure to make it possible for digital to play in those far-off places,‚Äù says Albert Tinio, chief commercial officer and co-founder of digital bank GoTyme. The company is a partnership between Philippine conglomerate Gokongwei Group and Singapore-headquartered Tyme.
The Philippines‚Äô telco space has long been dominated by Globe Telecom and Smart Communications. However, a new player called Dito Telecommunity entered the market in March with the hope of breaking this duopoly.
Globe and Smart are connected to e-wallets GCash and PayMaya, respectively. GCash has teamed up with CIMB Bank, which offers online banking services and has a universal bank license. PayMaya, meanwhile, will launch its digital bank, Maya Bank, in Q1 2022. Maya Bank is under Voyager Innovations, a Philippine tech firm backed by Chinese giant Tencent.

Many Filipinos continue to use outdated smartphone models, but these devices can‚Äôt support digital banking apps that need to be regularly updated. / Photo credit: 123RF.com

Another hurdle for the sector is how Filipinos tend to hold on to older smartphones, an industry source who requested anonymity tells Tech in Asia. These earlier models, however, can‚Äôt support apps that need to be frequently updated. Digital banking apps, in particular, often upgrade their platforms to keep transactions secure.
As of 2020, the Philippines had a 72% penetration rate for smartphones, according to a Statista report, though it didn‚Äôt mention how old the phones are.
Digital banks also have to continue addressing digital hesitancy. Although the number of digital bank account holders is expected to hit 26 million by 2026, there are people like writer Merck Maguddayao who still prefer holding cash over actively transacting online.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to put a huge aspect of my life online for security,‚Äù he tells Tech in Asia.
His security-related misgivings around online banking aren‚Äôt unfounded. For example, about 700 account holders of BDO Unibank ‚Äì one of the country‚Äôs largest banks ‚Äì lost nearly US$1,000 to around US$3,000 after a series of unauthorized transfers in December.
The BSP said that ‚Äúa sophisticated fraud technique‚Äù was used, with BDO‚Äôs 10-year-old for-phase out system believed to have been exploited.
While Maguddayao does have a bank account, he prefers using his debit card to withdraw money from machines. The only time he made a digital transaction was when he bought a computer table to help him work from home amid the pandemic.
‚ÄúIf you have easy access to buying stuff online, you might also end up spending more than intended,‚Äù he adds.
GoTyme representatives and the unnamed industry source agreed that having a tangible means of depositing and withdrawing cash would appease the fears of potential digital banking users. Digital banks such as Singapore-based Tonik and institutions like ING that offer digital banking services are addressing this by providing physical cards that can be used at any ATM.

As for GoTyme, it could allow account holders to make deposits and withdrawals at commercial business establishments located at Gokongwei Group properties soon. The Philippine conglomerate has a vast footprint, which includes consumer food and beverage brands, convenience stores, drug stores, malls, and an airline.
The shift to digital also brings some risks for banks, ‚Äúespecially when onboarding customers with no credit record,‚Äù says Angus Mackintosh, founder of CrossASEAN Research.
Existing traditional banks that have digital entities might also end up cannibalizing their own customer bases, he adds.
‚ÄúThe idea is to target a different customer base and offer more tailored products such as targeting millennials, or offering buy now, pay later, or targeting micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises which are currently unbanked,‚Äù he says. However, traditional players often have difficulty offering such digital-focused services, Mackintosh notes.
But as with many other segments, Covid-19 has changed the digital banking landscape. The pandemic pushed several Filipinos to start using e-wallets, driving the country to have the highest adoption rate in Asia Pacific.
As work-from-home policies pressed people to transact online, the Philippines‚Äô central bank saw digital payments breach 4 trillion pesos (US$79 billion) in value last year.
That said, it‚Äôs¬†‚Äúa little bit naive to think that people can immediately go from cash to cashless,‚Äù warns GoTyme‚Äôs Tinio. ‚ÄúThat is a fast transition. You need a step in between,‚Äù he notes, adding that this is where digital banking comes in.
Six is not a crowd
In October 2021, the BSP issued digital bank licenses to only six players to monitor how the local banking space would react to this new type of financial institution.

The six entities to get the license include GoTyme, Maya Bank, and Tonik, as well as Overseas Filipino Bank (OFBank), which is under state-owned Land Bank of the Philippines; Union Digital Bank, a subsidiary of UnionBank; and Unobank, a Singapore-based fintech firm.
License grantees are given a year to start operations, though OFBank and Tonik are already offering digital bank services as of writing.
Nine other applicants for the license were not approved, as ‚Äúthey had not completed the requirements in time,‚Äù according to a BSP statement. The central bank did not name these applicants.
But players in the space feel there is a need for more digital bank operators in the Philippine market.
While the entry of digital banks means more players in the banking space, it is a ‚Äúmisnomer to say it is crowded,‚Äù Jojo Malolos, president and CEO of GoTyme, tells Tech in Asia. The executive, who is also a board director of Tyme, adds that the industry has yet to ‚Äúaddress the issue of the unbanked.‚Äù
Having lots of players also helps to accelerate financial inclusion, says Greg Krasnov, founder and CEO of Tonik Bank. ‚ÄúMore digital banks and fintech companies are, in fact, a solution to drive Filipinos to become more financially literate and responsible with their money.‚Äù
That said, don‚Äôt expect traditional banks to just step aside as those in the space will also form part of the competition, says CrossASEAN Research‚Äôs Mackintosh. Long-time players in Indonesia, for example, are ‚Äúsetting up their own standalone digital banks.‚Äù
Digital remedy for traditional banking pains
Experts contend that the number of players in the Philippines isn‚Äôt the biggest pain point. Instead, it‚Äôs the processes that potential banking customers have to go through in order to open an account.
Besides the required personal appearances, people must also have a valid identification card. Unfortunately, traditional banks differ on the type of IDs that they accept, something that experts hope the recently launched national ID system will help address.

However, there are still a whole host of other hurdles, such as the need to make repeat branch visits, present a bunch of required documents, and endure long wait times just to get services like a loan. Often, these pain points are not even identified because it has become ‚Äúroutine‚Äù for customers, says Tinio. Helping people recognize these issues with commonplace transactions will help them embrace digital banking, he says.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve honestly never met anyone who woke up one day excited to go to their local bank and stay there for hours, just running their errands and transactions,‚Äù added Tonik‚Äôs Krasnov.
Digital banks solves this problem because they don‚Äôt need brick-and-mortar branches and their processes are digitalized. Customers just need a valid ID and a smartphone to avail of the platforms‚Äô services. This convenience also extends to Filipinos outside the country, as in the case of OFBank
For Filipinos abroad, ‚Äúa top priority is sending money to their loved ones and be able to save as well for their future needs,‚Äù Leila Martin, president and CEO of OFBank, tells Tech in Asia. These transactions usually need a bank account, which ‚Äútraditionally would require a physical visit to a bank, go through a lot of documentation, and have at least 500 pesos (US$10) as initial deposit,‚Äù she adds.
Mobile phones are also the main point of contact for digital banks, which bodes well for traditional financial institutions looking at their digital banking arms as virtual extensions of their offline services.
In GoTyme‚Äôs case, any branch of Gokongwei-owned convenience store Ministop or pharmacy chain Southstar Drug may be tapped to deliver digital banking services in their respective areas. Ministop and Southstar Drug have more than 500 branches each nationwide. Robinsons Malls, which is also owned by the Gokongwei Group, has 52 locations all over the Philippines as well.
‚ÄúThere is also an issue of the maintaining balance. A lot of Filipinos live on small incomes, but there are usually minimum amounts needed to open and maintain an account with traditional banks,‚Äù says the anonymous industry source.
Accounts with 5,000 pesos (US$98.78) and below in deposits make up 68% of the total number of bank accounts in the country, according to recent BSP figures. This amount is the average minimum balance required by most banks in the country to open and maintain an account.
Considering that the minimum wage in the Philippines is between US$6.22 to US$10.6 per day for non-agricultural work, gross monthly salaries would be between US$124.48 to US$212.21. This makes it hard for most workers to open and maintain accounts with traditional banks.
As a result, digital and online banking players become viable options for users who are eager to start saving, as they allow new accounts to be opened with zero maintaning balance.
While there are Filipinos like Quiambao who are forced to make at least two trips to a branch just to open an account or people like Maguddayao who are hesitant to transact online, there are also those who are not even eligible to open their own accounts. But thanks to technology, banking may become more convenient in the Philippines.

724292,2022-01-07T02:00:22,Context matters: International business communication takes more than just translation,"In 1987, Braniff Airlines made a critically embarrassing error.
The US-based carrier wanted to show off its luxurious leather seats but made a mistake when translating its marketing materials into Spanish. Because the Spanish terms for ‚Äúin leather‚Äù and ‚Äúnaked‚Äù sound extremely similar, Braniff ended up telling the Hispanic market to ‚Äúfly naked.‚Äù
Such gaffes are a clear reminder of why effective and accurate communication is vital, especially in a globalized world.
However, language barriers remain a perennial issue in international business communications. Despite English being considered the world‚Äôs top business language, less than 400 million people use it as a first language.
‚ÄúThis language barrier can lead to frictions in collaboration, productivity, customer service, and global expansion,‚Äù says Fardad Zabetian, CEO and co-founder of Kudo, a multilingual web conferencing platform. Miscommunication could lead companies to miss out on crucial business opportunities or damage their reputation.
Indeed, 64% of respondents in a 2012 survey conducted by the Economist Intelligence Unit said that differences in language and culture made it difficult to gain market share in new territories.
More harm than good
While companies have several options to overcome the language barrier, not all are effective. In fact, some could even create new problems.
For instance, companies might rely on bilingual employees to act as interpreters. But because they aren‚Äôt professionally trained, technical material and linguistic subtleties that could change the meaning of a word or sentence might escape their notice, Zabetian explains.

Fardad Zabetian, CEO and co-founder of Kudo / Photo credit: Kudo

Adding interpretation to an employee‚Äôs job responsibilities also hurts their productivity and wastes key resources. At the big-picture level, this distracts a company from its core growth efforts.
To help with written translations, some businesses use automated online translation tools like DeepL. However, these tools tend to fall short when unfamiliar cultural nuances need to be taken into account, particularly when there‚Äôs no proper oversight from professional interpreters.
Being aware of these nuances is especially important in countries with high-context cultures such as Japan, China, and France, where people rely on underlying context, meaning, and tone during communication. Any of these elements could alter the way customers perceive messages.
The inability of automated tools to consider cultural contexts could potentially cause misunderstandings and communication errors that are damaging to the company‚Äôs brand.
‚ÄúSimultaneous interpretation requires emotional intelligence and the ability to produce ‚Äòneutral‚Äô language to match the audience‚Äôs cultural context,‚Äù observes Zabetian.¬† 
Get a professional
Ultimately, the best way for businesses to overcome the language barrier is by using professional interpreters, according to Zabetian. In this regard, companies can look to service providers like Kudo.
‚ÄúUsing professional interpreters with experience in the subject matter will ensure the message is communicated accurately and matches the audience‚Äôs cultural sensitivities,‚Äù he explains.
Online platforms also allow for interpretation to be conducted remotely ‚Äì a great boon for companies that need to quickly reach a global audience. Kudo, for its part, hosts a marketplace that allows companies to book interpreters for multilingual meetings up to two hours prior to an event.

This feature came in handy in 2018, when the Inter-American Telecommunication Commission (CITEL) took part in a two-week-long conference in Dubai. The organization wanted to hold daily briefing sessions for its members during the conference, but that required interpretating information into English and Spanish.
CITEL members were able to attend briefings dubbed in the language of their choice through remote interpretation services provided by Kudo. This allowed CITEL to help its members make the most out of their time at the conference. CITEL also got onboarding assistance prior to the event to ensure that it could learn to use Kudo‚Äôs platform effectively.
Using professional interpretation services also shows that companies genuinely want to understand their audience‚Äôs point of view. In situations that involve sensitive information, such as health concerns or legal matters, this sincerity is instrumental in winning the other party‚Äôs trust.
For example, a study published in the Health, Risk &amp; Society journal found that patient trust in doctors was linked with their willingness to engage in medical procedures or alternative therapies in which the long-term risks were unclear. This shows the importance of sincerity in communication ‚Äì something that may be lost in ineffective translation.
During meetings, companies can overcome the language barrier and smooth out communication if they can provide a good interpretation experience.
In this regard, AI-powered tools like live captioning could be useful in meetings when simultaneous interpretation is necessary, as they allow participants to quickly identify who is talking. It can also help promote inclusivity for variety of users, including those who are hard of hearing.
Apart from live-captioning capabilities, Kudo‚Äôs platform offers other AI solutions such as an interpreter assistance tool. Thanks to this feature, interpreters can generate a glossary of translated terms from documents, web pages, and keywords before meetings take place. By planning ahead, they can ensure that the interpretation ‚Äì even when it includes technically difficult subjects ‚Äì can flow smoothly and accurately.
Overcoming the final obstacle
The demand for bilingual capabilities in international business communications grew by more than 2x in five years. As such, platforms that provide interpretation and translation services will have a sizable impact on business capabilities.
‚ÄúFor businesses looking to globalize, interpretation is essential,‚Äù says Zabetian. ‚ÄúIt gives clients and partners a better overall experience, and it facilitates communication and collaboration without anything being lost in translation.‚Äù
He believes that remote simultaneous interpretation platforms like Kudo will eventually become seamlessly integrated into all business communications, making multilingual interactions the norm. When that happens, the world can move towards a more ‚Äúpromising‚Äù and interconnected future.
‚ÄúThe language barrier is the last obstacle that must be overcome for people and businesses to truly connect on a global scale,‚Äù he contends.

Kudo is a live interpretation platform that gives users the power to be understood by allowing them to engage in their preferred language, removing language barriers and easing communication.

If you‚Äôre not a subscriber, get access by registering here.
The new year is here, and we‚Äôre back to talk about all things ecommerce.
During the holidays, I had time to browse the Shopee app almost daily. In Vietnam ‚Äì where I‚Äôm based ‚Äì the influence of the shopping platform‚Äôs parent firm, Sea Group, is astonishing.
Shopee is so popular among local consumers that ‚Äúfind it on Shopee‚Äù has become a catchphrase. ShopeeFood, which is a rebrand of local food delivery player Now (bought by Sea Group in 2017 for US$64 million), is in a head-to-head battle with GrabFood. Similarly, Garena, Sea‚Äôs digital entertainment arm, has been among the top game developers and publishers in the country for about a decade.
The name Sea Group might not ring a bell with end consumers, many of whom are already part of its thriving ecosystem. But that‚Äôs not an issue. The company has been known for quietly making moves in different segments, conquering markets at a speed that puzzles everyone.
In 2009, the group‚Äôs co-founders ‚Äì Forrest Li, Gang Ye, and David Chen ‚Äì operated Garena out of a shophouse in Singapore. But besides the trio, who else is steering the wheels of the current Sea Group empire?
For this week‚Äôs The Big Story, we have diverged a bit from our usual approach. My colleague Budi Sutrisno maps out Sea Group‚Äôs key decision-makers in our org chart. How do they fit into the company‚Äôs ambitions, which evidently stretch far beyond Southeast Asia?
Meanwhile, Bukalapak, one of Shopee‚Äôs local rivals in Indonesia, has reshuffled its leadership team. Our reporter, Aditya Hadi Pratama, analyzes the implications of its CEO‚Äôs sudden resignation to join the government just months after the ecommerce firm debuted on the public market.

THE HOT TAKE
What‚Äôs behind the resignation of Bukalapak‚Äôs CEO?

Former Bukalapak CEO Muhammad Rachmat Kaimuddin (fourth from left)/ Photo credit: Bukalapak

Here‚Äôs what happened:
Muhammad Rachmat Kaimuddin, the CEO of recently listed Indonesian ecommerce major Bukalapak, submitted his resignation letter to the firm on December 28.
He immediately joined the Indonesian Coordinating Ministry for Maritime and Investment Affairs as a special advisor.
Bukalapak has nominated its chief operating officer, Willix Halim, to become the company‚Äôs new CEO.
Here‚Äôs our take:
‚ÄúMy long-term goal was to join an organization that can make an impact on society by doing good, and I really like what these guys [Bukalapak] are doing.‚Äù
‚ÄúMy vision is to build a strong foundation for Bukalapak so it can become a ‚Äòphoenix,‚Äô a company that can last for 100 years or longer.‚Äù
Those are statements from Kaimuddin when he was appointed as the chief executive of Bukalapak in late 2019, replacing the company‚Äôs founder Achmad Zaky. On top of that, he also pledged to make the company IPO-ready, a feat he was able to accomplish.

Kaimuddin‚Äôs two-year stint as Bukalapak‚Äôs CEO was fairly short. Median CEO tenure globally is around five years, according to PwC. His resignation took place only months after Bukalapak went public as well.
Similar to other tech companies, Bukalapak implemented a dual-class share structure in the beginning. However, as the company set to go public early last year, it abolished the classification and converted its stock to common shares.
The Indonesian Financial Services Authority (OJK) didn‚Äôt allow a company with multiple voting shares to go public until late last year, after Bukalapak launched its IPO.
This means Kaimuddin‚Äôs 0.1% share in Bukalapak only gives him a small influence over the company. Halim, the newly nominated CEO, has the highest number of shares in Bukalapak compared to the company‚Äôs other C-level executives, but he still doesn‚Äôt make the top five shareholders overall.


Many tech companies in Indonesia, such as Gojek, Tokopedia, and Traveloka, have raised several funding rounds that have diluted their founders‚Äô shares. Without voting shares, a founder or CEO would be more easily removed if his or her leadership is questioned by other shareholders.
Stability in question?
Bukalapak‚Äôs share price plunged 6% to 424 rupiah (around US$0.03) per share after the news of Kaimuddin‚Äôs resignation was released. But it surged back to 500 rupiah on January 4 after the company announced its investment in Allo Bank‚Äôs right issue process.
In Q3 2021, Bukalapak reported US$33.8 million in revenue ‚Äì a 58% jump compared to the same period in the previous year ‚Äì following an acceleration in its online-to-offline business, Mitra Bukalapak. The company‚Äôs operating loss for the nine months of 2021 also narrowed by 13% to US$84.9 million.

Bukalapak‚Äôs cash position grew from US$191 million in Q2 2021 to 23 trillion rupiah (around US$1.6 billion) at the end of the quarter, following the firm‚Äôs public listing.
If the funds are used effectively, the company can pursue other business lines. Since its IPO, the firm has expanded to or invested in the blockchain, digital bank, and bookkeeping sectors.
Despite its management reshuffle, the company‚Äôs share price will be safe as long as Bukalapak can continue to perform. That‚Äôs why its next financial report will be crucial.

Org Chart maps out the people at the top of Asia‚Äôs most prominent tech companies. Who are the key decision-makers? How are the teams organized? What does it tell us about the company‚Äôs priorities? We continue this series with leading consumer internet company Sea.
When Sea Group started in 2009, there were hardly any hints that it would eventually become the poster child of Southeast Asian tech. Co-founders Forrest Li, Gang Ye, and David Chen ran Garena ‚Äì now the group‚Äôs worldwide digital entertainment arm ‚Äì out of a shophouse in Singapore, before making the game-changing move of diving into fintech and ecommerce with SeaMoney in 2014 and Shopee in 2015.
Still, it seems that the company is nowhere near done. The next frontier seems to be digital banking: In December 2020, Sea Group was awarded a digital full bank license in Singapore and swiftly acquired an Indonesian bank (which then became SeaBank) within weeks.
Sea Group is also making a mark outside its core Southeast Asia market. Shopee is thriving in Latin America, especially Brazil, and is eyeing markets like India, Poland, and Spain.
Sea also: Visualizing Sea‚Äôs rapid rise
While Li has served as Sea‚Äôs CEO since it was founded, Gang and Chen have held various roles throughout the journey.
Gang was the group‚Äôs CTO between 2010 and 2016 before replacing Chen as group COO in January 2017. Chen also transitioned from the group‚Äôs chief of staff to Shopee‚Äôs chief product officer by December 2019.
As Sea diversified further, so did its internal structure. Chris Feng, who joined Sea in March 2014 to lead its mobile game business, was a major addition to the group. Feng now leads two of Sea‚Äôs major entities, serving as Shopee‚Äôs CEO since July 2015 and as the CEO of SeaMoney since March 2020.
Recently, Feng was also appointed president of Sea Group, effective January 1, 2022. He continues to lead Shopee and SeaMoney and reports directly to Li.
Here are a few more observations:

Nick Nash, before forming private equity firm Asia Partners, was Sea Group‚Äôs president. He resigned in 2018, and the position remained vacant until Feng‚Äôs appointment.
Jin Oh, the former CEO of Garena, also resigned in 2018. Later, Terry Zhao, who had served in several senior roles at Garena, was promoted to lead the gaming arm as its president.
While Sea Group has expanded into numerous countries within and outside Southeast Asia, Maneerut Anulomsombut (Nok), Sea Thailand CEO, is the group‚Äôs only country-specific CEO.

Alan Hellawell, former group chief strategy officer, was another C-level executive in Sea Group‚Äôs history.
Two relative veterans at the company are leading Shopee‚Äôs charge into Latin America. Jianghong Liu spent over five years at Shopee ‚Äì most recently as head of cross-border ecommerce ‚Äì before becoming head of Shopee Mexico. Pine Kyaw spent four years as the country head for Shopee Vietnam before taking on the same role for Brazil.

ShopeeFood¬†is one of Shopee‚Äôs newer products¬†but it‚Äôs unclear whether a specific executive oversees the food delivery service. That said, many ShopeeFood team members concurrently work on ShopeePay.

Sea Group declined to participate in this story.

Premium summary
The investors‚Äô darlings of SEA

Funding is the bread and butter of any startup ecosystem and is celebrated as a major milestone for a startup. While it may seem that most budding startups bag a funding round or two with relative ease, the difficulty of working towards and securing funding should not be understated. The countless stories of startup empires beginning from cramped garages exist for a reason.
Having said that, let‚Äôs look at some startups that have put in the hard yards and are now reaping the rewards of their labor.


In a league of its own: Sea Group is a Southeast Asian tech behemoth with businesses spanning across gaming, ecommerce, fintech and, possibly, the metaverse. However, it did not reach the lofty valuation of nearly US$100 billion without massive funding. Sea Group leads our list with US$9 billion in funding ‚Äì double that of logistics firm J&amp;T Express, which comes in second.


Dominant ecosystems: Apart from Vietnam‚Äôs The CrownX,  the top 10 startups in our list are from either Singapore or Indonesia. Sea Group, Grab, Trax Retail, Emeritus, and Ninja Logistics represent the Lion City, while J&amp;T Express, Bukalapak and GoTo Group are from the region‚Äôs largest archipelago.


An anomaly: The 20 top-funded startups and tech companies in Southeast Asia are packed with major players from various sectors. Marketplaces, fintech and logistics are some of investors‚Äô favorite industries. However, only one crypto-focused company got a spot: Bitkub is a platform that allows individuals to buy, sell, and store cryptocurrencies.

Issuing shares with voting rights ‚Äì also known as dual-class shares ‚Äì is a popular way for founders to retain control of the company after it has gone public. Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook), Ford, Berkshire Hathaway, and Google are some famous companies that follow this ownership structure.
Here, we look at how Sea Group leverages the flexibility of this structure to ease any potential concerns over its operations in India.


Consolidating power: The company plans to increase the voting power rights of CEO Forrest Li to 57% from the current 54%. His voting power will go up as each class B ordinary share will see an increase in voting power from three votes to 15 votes.


Loosening ties: Sea will reduce the voting power rights of investor Tencent to less than 10%. At the same time, the Chinese tech titan will convert all its class B ordinary shares to class A ordinary shares. Once the conversion is completed, Li will own all of Sea‚Äôs class B ordinary shares.


Context: Last month, the company‚Äôs ecommerce arm Shopee faced calls for a ban in India as a local trade body alleged that Sea had ‚ÄúChinese roots‚Äù and was operated by Tencent. The Indian government has previously banned several Chinese apps including short-video platform TikTok and has taken a tough stance on firms backed heavily by Chinese investors.

Delivered every Wednesday via email and through the Tech in Asia website, this free newsletter breaks down the biggest stories and trends in fintech. If you‚Äôre not a subscriber, get access by registering here.
Hello there,
Happy New Year! We hope the past few days were restful for you. I sure did enjoy unplugging for a good week and a half while our office closed for a year-end break.
But back to the grind:
‚ÄúFeature or product?‚Äù was something that many people asked about buy now, pay later (BNPL) as the trend swept across the globe.
It‚Äôs a fair question. After all, assuming all things are constant, are you as a consumer more likely to try a new product or service from a platform you already use, or try a whole new application altogether?
If you‚Äôre like me and prefer using apps in silos ‚Äì i.e., having one app per service ‚Äì you might find yourself eventually running low on real estate on your smartphone‚Äôs homepage, or needlessly scrolling through pages of apps just to locate the one you need.
The early wage access (EWA) sector is grappling with the same dilemma. This is particularly evident in Indonesia, where pure-play companies from GagiGesa and Wagely to established peer-to-peer lenders, staffing platforms, and software companies are flocking to the space, as my colleague Ardi writes in this week‚Äôs big story.
(We‚Äôve covered the EWA model from a regional perspective and the billion dollar opportunity it affords in an earlier story, so do check that out if you haven‚Äôt.)
The answer to that question ‚Äì at least in the BNPL space ‚Äì has become clearer in recent months, as tech juggernauts such as Apple, PayPal, and Block (formerly Square) have acquired BNPL outfits to provide the service on top of their existing hardware, payment, or merchant offerings. These incumbents could have a real edge over younger BNPL firms, owing to the sheer size of their consumer and enterprise customer bases, as well as the pools of data available to them.
The same could apply in the EWA space. Will software firms that can tap existing relationships with enterprise clients beat EWA-focused startups to the punch? Read on to find out.
Meanwhile, our analysis this week features CitaDAO, a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform for real estate that has the potential to change the way people invest in properties.

THE BIG STORY
Is earned wage access Indonesia‚Äôs latest hot ticket?

While startups like GajiGesa and Wagely have stolen the spotlight in the earned wage access segment, numerous VC-backed companies have quietly stepped into the arena.

THE HOT TAKE
Real estate ownership on the blockchain
Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs going to happen:

CitaDAO, a DeFi platform for real estate, will launch its first ‚Äúintroducing real estate on-chain (IRO)‚Äù process this Friday, Jan. 7, for a freehold commercial building in the UK.
During the IRO process, community members determine if a property will be tokenized by committing USDC, a US-dollar stablecoin.
Built on the Ethereum ecosystem, CitaDAO says that it overcomes the frictions of owning physical real estate such as illiquidity and high costs.
Individual property owners can list their real estate on the CitaDAO platform and mint their own real estate NFTs.
Token holders own a fraction of the title deed of the underlying real estate through an ERC20 real estate token (RET).

Here‚Äôs what it means:
Real estate is an age-old way of building and preserving wealth, whether through buying actual properties or investing in real estate investment trusts (REITs). CitaDAO is taking a new approach to the investment vehicle by breaking up real estate title deeds into smaller pieces and selling them as blockchain tokens (a process called fractionalizing).

It‚Äôs worth noting that the division of assets in real estate isn‚Äôt new. REITs, for instance, are another ‚Äì albeit analog ‚Äì way of breaking up properties into affordable chunks that can be owned and traded by retail investors on a stock exchange.
CitaDAO‚Äôs differentiation is that it is breaking up these properties on a blockchain, making it easier for people around the world to own its real estate portfolio. And while each REIT consists of multiple properties, CitaDAO issues tokens for individual assets.
Through an IRO event, interested investors can commit their interest by staking USDC, a US-dollar stablecoin. Following a successful event, RETs are distributed to holders based on their amounts staked, effectively giving each token holder a piece of real estate ‚Äì or, more accurately, a piece of its title deed.
This piece gives RET holders the right to buy out all other token holders and to legally redeem the full title deed of the underlying property.
The organization also plans to issue a separate CitaDAO token that gives holders the ability to vote on its decisions. It will also allocate 2% of every property it lists to the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), giving token holders exposure to its entire portfolio.
CitaDAO is confident that a majority of high-quality real estate will inevitably be tokenized as assets. The DAO says that it has a pipeline of US$240 million worth of real estate that will be tokenized within the next six months.
CitaDAO isn‚Äôt the only firm tokenizing real estate: Shareable Assets is a Singapore-based asset tokenization platform which has issued real estate-backed security tokens based on physical residential and hospitality properties in the UK.
Seoul-based property investment platform Kasa also issues digital asset-backed securities that represent fractional ownership of commercial properties, which can be traded on the Kasa exchange. It plans to launch an asset-backed securities platform in Singapore this year.

Landlords are constantly on the hunt for new sources of capital and higher yields, so it‚Äôs no surprise that real estate sits at the forefront of tokenization.
It‚Äôs worth noting that even within fractionalized real estate, there are different business models. Some platforms purchase the real estate before tokenizing it, while CitaDAO simply transfers the title deed for the real estate from the existing landlord to a special purpose vehicle.
CitaDAO‚Äôs offering could change DeFi in the following ways:

Any landlord can list their properties on the platform (after going through verification and anti-money laundering/know-your-customer checks), making the model highly scalable.
As the ecosystem of DeFi products around real estate grows, RETs can be used in other DeFi applications. For example, RETs can form part of an index token for investors that want exposure to diverse assets. Borrowers could also offer their RETs as collateral.
CitaDAO could offer a way to stabilize crypto markets. Given that property values often appreciate over time and are less volatile than cryptocurrencies, RETs could form the backing for a stablecoin that also hedges against inflation. It also promises to supply token holders with access to additional yield in the form of rental incomes.

But there are important legal and regulatory concerns to consider. Say RETs are successfully awarded to 1,000 different token holders. Would all of these token holders‚Äô names be listed on the property‚Äôs title deed at the local city council level? If not, will they be listed in any legal documents?
Also, after an IRO event, who owns the property? How is ownership split between the original landlord and RET holders? Does the RET holder have a right to a property‚Äôs cash flow?
But the hardest questions will arise months or maybe years down the road, when the actual property exchanges hands. If stamp duties are incurred, does each token holder share in the cost? Are property taxes split among all token holders? In the event of a downturn where the valuation of the property falls sharply ‚Äì or worse still, is foreclosed by a bank ‚Äì what happens to each token?
There‚Äôs also selection and exclusion biases built in. There‚Äôs a higher chance that landlords who seek capital streams in alternative routes ‚Äì such as through tokenization ‚Äì own assets that are less appealing than those included in REITs.
Accountability will remain a key question as DAOs proliferate and mature. According to CitaDAO, a property manager will be appointed to lease and manage the real estate. This manager is chosen after inviting all ‚Äúqualified property managers‚Äù on the DAO to submit proposals including their projections for expected rent, operating costs, and the property management fee for the upcoming year.
The property manager who submits the proposal with the most optimal metrics is automatically appointed, while manage‚Äã‚Äãrs who significantly underperform are automatically replaced by the person with the next best proposal. While such an approach certainly decentralizes authority, a question here is whether metrics like track record and qualifications should also be taken into account.

Founded in June 2021, Anfin aims to make it easier for retail investors in Vietnam to access a variety of financial assets from stocks and bonds, to structured investment products, among others.
The company also helps new investors trade with lower risk through fractional share trading, which is in line with Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange‚Äôs (HoSE) plans to reduce the minimum lot of shares per trade.
Anfin will use the fresh funds to develop its platform to provide retail investors with real-time fractional share trading.
In December 2021, Anfin inked an agreement with Viet Tin Securities (VTSS), a State Securities Commission-licensed brokerage firm, to integrate and optimize the former‚Äôs trading systems.
The stock trading platform has raised funds amid an economic recovery in Vietnam as the country operates in a new normal state with a high vaccine coverage.
The HoSE hit an all-time high of 1,500.81 points in November, up 120% from the low it hit in March 2020, when the country was hit by the first wave Covid-19 cases.

The company‚Äôs offering was launched amid the Covid-19 pandemic, which helped it onboard users quickly. The app now has over 30,000 monthly active users.
Pandai began as a free service before it rolled out its paid feature at the beginning of 2021. However, despite the number of paid users increasing by 25% every month, the company said the feature is not its focus right now.
‚ÄúWe still want to improve the stickiness of our app and prolong the time that users spend in the app,‚Äù Khairul Anwar Mohamad Zaki, the company‚Äôs chief executive, told Tech in Asia.
To date, users spend around 57 minutes a day on the app, and the company wants to push that number to 90 minutes and boost its monthly active users as well.

727045,2022-01-05T01:55:09,Is earned wage access Indonesia‚Äôs latest hot ticket?,"In mid-2020, Datta Dirgayusa was approached by a startup that wanted to offer earned wage access (EWA) services to his employer.
It was an encounter the HR supervisor had anticipated, having followed the rapid development of Indonesia‚Äôs EWA startups since late 2019. But after hearing the pitch, Dirgayusa ‚Äì who manages over 500 employees for the Jakarta-based hospitality firm he worked for ‚Äì was unconvinced and turned down the offer.
‚ÄúWe had not done any internal analysis or survey on whether EWA is needed or not,‚Äù he says. Questions over the startup‚Äôs legal standing and the pricing also factored into the company‚Äôs decision, he adds.
But while this was Dirgayusa‚Äôs first conversation with an EWA provider, it probably won‚Äôt be his last.

In the past 12 months, Indonesia has seen companies flock to the EWA space from different verticals, all attempting to win over employers by giving workers instant access to their wages even before their payday.
The media spotlight has largely fallen upon companies like GajiGesa, Wagely, which are spearheaded by high-profile founders and have earned interest from notable global VC firms. However, a significant number of other startups have tiptoed their way into the space as well.


Financial advisory platform Halofina has rolled out Halogaji to tap into the EWA sector, while peer-to-peer lenders KoinWorks and Modalku have also jumped on the bandwagon with their platforms KoinGaji and Modal Kasbon, respectively. Alami, a Sharia-compliant P2P platform, is also piloting a similar product.
In the parallel segment of human resource information systems (HRIS), Jojonomic has launched a platform called Gajian on Demand, and software company Mekari says it is set to launch an EWA-like product under its employee benefits platform Mekari Flex.
Similarly, staffing startup Workmate has started offering EWA services to selected clients, while outsourcing platform MyRobin has launched a similar product for its blue-collar partners and (potentially) external users.
The bullishness in the sector is understandable. In a previous story, we estimated EWA to be a billion-dollar opportunity in Southeast Asia, with Indonesia taking the largest slice of the pie.
The country is home to the biggest underbanked and unbanked population in the region, with only 23% of its some 270 million citizens having full access to banking services.
Among the underbanked are lower-income workers, who live from paycheck to paycheck ‚Äì many on minimum wage. For them, the EWA option would serve as a safer alternative to the likes of loan sharks.
Crowd puller
The arrival of several new players into the vertical makes sense, says GajiGesa co-founder and CEO Vidit Agrawal. Given the interesting business model and huge market opportunity, Agrawal says that other startups have tried to ‚Äúcopy‚Äù GajiGesa, which claims to be the pioneer in the space.
That said, many of its peers point to overseas EWA companies as their inspirations. Wagestream, a UK-based firm and investor in GajiGesa, has raised almost $80 million in total funding while Payactiv in the US is reportedly valued at over $500 million. Some also argue that the move to offer EWA products is simply an extension of their existing services that puts them in an advantageous position.

KoinWorks, for example, launched KoinGaji as an additional product to strengthen its position as a ‚Äúsuper financial app‚Äù for SMEs in Indonesia. Other than EWA, its array of financial services includes working capital loans, invoice financing, and supply chain financing.
Similarly, Finch Capital-backed Halofina sees EWA as a sub-vertical in the larger game of digital wealth management, an arena it entered when it launched its financial planner and robo-advisory app in 2017.
‚ÄúSince the beginning, our mission is to help people in managing their money better, so the strategy to expand into employee financial wellness (including EWA) is aligned with our core mission,‚Äù says Halofina co-founder and CEO Adjie Wicaksana.
While fintech serves as a convenient segue for companies to foray into EWA, several industry players point out that software-as-a-service companies can make notable strides in the field due to their existing relationships with employers.
Mekari, for example, claims that over 35,000 businesses have used at least one of its SaaS solutions, with over 3,000 specifically using its HRIS and payroll software. It also launched Mekari Flex in 2020, which is closely related to EWA. The company‚Äôs imminent rollout of its EWA product would then be a simple matter of cross-selling to existing clients, which would likely give the company a considerable head start in the industry.
‚ÄúWe hope that their employees will be happier and not fall into predatory loans. HRs will also benefit because it can boost employee retention,‚Äù says Mekari CEO Suwandi Soh.
Observing the increasingly crowded EWA space, 1982 Ventures ‚Äì a fintech-focused VC firm that has invested in Wagely ‚Äì says that the segment will not be a ‚Äúwinner takes all‚Äù game. However, he questions the fate of those that treat EWA as a mere side business.
‚ÄúFocus is key to win any market. EWA is hot, and many of these other players are just getting on the bandwagon,‚Äù says 1982 Ventures partner Herston Powers.
Same service, different approach
The emergence of a handful of EWA players in a short period of time can be seen as a validation of the opportunity in the space, but it also indicates that there‚Äôs a pretty low barrier to entry.
‚ÄúThe product needed to provide EWA is fairly simple. When we closed our first client, we just made use of WhatsApp and did disbursals manually,‚Äù says Gajiku co-founder and CEO Sherman Tanuwidjaja. ‚ÄúThis allows new providers to easily come in and launch an MVP (minimum viable product) in weeks.‚Äù
Gajiku, which is backed by VC firms including AC Ventures and Sampoerna, says its approach differs from those of its peers. While companies like GajiGesa and Wagely follow the Wagestream model (aka being an employee financial wellness app), Gajiku caters to employers through its enterprise suites, which currently include payroll disbursal, as well as attendance tracking and loan management modules.
However, Jojonomic, Mekari, KoinWorks, and Modalku all appear to zero in on employers as well.
These differences in approach, among other things, impact how startups monetize their businesses. While employee-focused EWA solutions like GajiGesa and Halogaji largely levy its fees on employers, Gajiku and fellow employer-focused EWA services mostly charge employees for the withdrawals they make using the platforms.
Given the enormous size of the market, both approaches could prosper in the EWA space, according to YC Ng, a partner at VC firm AC Ventures.

It is likely, he reasons, that companies will find themselves gravitating toward different segments, as the ‚Äúthe behavior of employers and employees of a big enterprise is very different to an SME, which in turn is also very different to an MSME.‚Äù
For the moment, though, it seems as if most companies in the EWA space are targeting the same demand base. GajiGesa and Wagely both claim to be the leading and biggest players in the field.
Both firms have channeled all of their resources and efforts into the EWA business while also building other related products and capabilities.
Wagely aims to be the go-to financial wellness platform for workers, while Gajigesa wants to eventually become a holistic employee wellness platform for workers. The success of Wagestream and Payactiv serve as benchmarks for their business model.
As for the group of players expanding into EWA from an existing offering, only time will tell whether their new business warrants larger resources and investments or perhaps even being spun off into a separate business. As one founder who requested anonymity contends, having EWA as an additional product is ‚Äì for the moment ‚Äì the best way to tap into the opportunity.
‚ÄúFor other countries, it seems that EWA can be a stand-alone product. In Indonesia, it is yet to be seen,‚Äù the person says.",Ardi Wirdana,Putra Muskita and Jaclyn Tiu,0,"['Analysis', 'Fintech', 'Premium Content']",True,True,6

Speaking exclusively to Tech in Asia, Sustiawan says he and three fellow founding partners (Bharat Ongso, Riswanto, and Ayunda Afifa) have set up a VC firm called Tunnelerate, which will look to raise a corpus of US$10 million for its first fund. The VC firm will also roll out an accelerator program that will provide an extensive ‚Äúsupport system‚Äù for new founders.

(From left) Tunnelerate partners Ayunda Afifa, Bharat Ongso, Ivan Arie Sustiawan, and Riswanto

The firm has started talking to numerous potential limited partners (LPs), and it targets to close the fund by mid-2022. Its accelerator program is set to kick off in early 2022.
Tunnelerate will focus on sectors such as fintech, agritech, and healthtech, says Sustiawan. Unlike many of its peers, the new VC firm will particularly be interested in backing promising founders in regions outside of Indonesia‚Äôs big cities.
‚ÄúWe want founders from regions in Indonesia to have a better chance to realize their dreams in this country,‚Äù says Sustiawan, who co-founded TaniHub in 2016 and currently sits as a board member of the company.
For Sustiawan, this is not his first stint at ‚Äúgiving back‚Äù to the country‚Äôs ecosystem, which he had always been eager to do. The former CEO previously made several angel investments into early-stage startups such as Jaring Pangan and Eratani, both agritech firms.
Championing local founders
At a time when the Indonesian startup scene appears to have become more favorable to founders from privileged families and those with overseas educational backgrounds, Tunnelerate is keen to ‚Äúlevel the playing field‚Äù for brilliant local founders that may not have the same privileges.
‚ÄúWe have met numerous founders from regions who have great ideas but maybe have found that the doors have always been closed on them. We hope to give a different color to the ecosystem,‚Äù says Afifa.
The firm says it will be curating top founders from different regions across Indonesia to join its accelerator program, where they will be given access to mentors and capital support.
The accelerator will select up to 15 startups for its first of two cohorts this year, which will begin in the second quarter of 2022. Of the participating startups, up to five companies will receive investments from the Tunnelerate fund.
Those that become portfolio companies of the firm will be given additional strategic and operational support from the Tunnelerate partners, who have all had extensive experience as business operators.
‚ÄúWe understand that being a founder is not easy, that difficult things will happen when you try to build a company. So we will put trust in them and be there for them through the ups and the downs,‚Äù says Sustiawan.
Leveraging the power of angels
Startups that join Tunnelerate‚Äôs portfolio will also receive support from the VC firm‚Äôs group of angel LPs.
Sustiawan says the LP base of Tunnelerate‚Äôs maiden fund will be largely made up of angel investors. Many of them are veteran local entrepreneurs who are eager to adapt with the times and pass on their trade to the next generations.
These profiles of LPs are plentiful in Indonesia, Sustiawan adds, but are largely untapped by the ecosystem, perhaps due to their ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù way of working.
‚ÄúThese kinds of people require a different approach. They are humble, so you need to show humility with them and be down to earth. Meetings with them take place in a rumah makan Padang (traditional Padang restaurant), instead of five-star hotels,‚Äù he explains.
These angels, who each put in a minimum of US$100,000 into the Tunnelerate fund, will be available for direct chats and sessions with the founders arranged by the VC.
‚ÄúThese are people who have been in the business for 20 years to 30 years in their respective fields. There are so many things that these people can teach to founders. We hope that these angels will not just be investors, but also support these founders,‚Äù says Afifa.",Ardi Wirdana,Collin Furtado and Lorenzo Kyle Subido,0,"['Investments', 'News', 'Startups']",True,False,3

726805,2022-01-03T01:55:32,Meet the players fighting plastic scourge in SEA,"
Southeast Asian countries throw away an estimated US$6 billion every year in recoverable or recyclable single-use plastics.
That figure‚Äôs set to soar as environmental priorities get sidetracked by health concerns around the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.
For Southeast Asia, the deluge of plastic waste is a pressing environmental and health risk, as well as a lost opportunity to tap into the circular economy. But innovators are gradually waking up to the possibilities, and their solutions could be the key to solving the crisis.

Can this green gold rush also help Southeast Asia finally kick its plastic habit? In this visual story, Tech in Asia highlights the region‚Äôs nascent ecosystem of plastic waste startups.
The rise of plastic alchemists
Most of the 47 startups tackling plastic waste identified by Tech in Asia and The Incubation Network, a Singapore-based impact initiative, reside in just four out of eleven ASEAN member states.

Players in the region operate across all stages of the plastic waste life cycle but mainly fall into two major categories:

Alternative plastics developers like Evoware, an Indonesian seaweed bioplastics firm, and Circlepac, a Malaysia-based compostable packaging manufacturer.
Repurposing and recycling solutions providers such as Magorium, a Singapore green construction firm, and Upp, a Vietnam-based plastics upcycler.


Most of these firms are also relatively young, with 77.1% of them having been founded after 2015. The drop in the number of new plastic waste startups in 2020 could partly be explained by shifting priorities amid the Covid-19 pandemic.

Plastic waste is ‚Äúone of the most present and urgent environmental problems in Southeast Asia,‚Äù says Simon Baldwin, global head of circularity for impact accelerator SecondMuse and Singapore-based impact initiative The Incubation Network.
But if that‚Äôs the case, why did the surge of plastic waste startups only happen after 2015? That‚Äôs likely due to two factors: China‚Äôs 2017 waste import ban ‚Äì which shifted the bulk of plastic dumping to Southeast Asia ‚Äì and growing consumer awareness of sustainability in recent years.

While Turkey became the major recipient of European plastic waste, the bulk of the world‚Äôs plastic trash headed toward landfills and other disposal facilities in Malaysia and Vietnam.
Is the plastic wave too big to tame?
Even as Southeast Asia‚Äôs plastic waste players gain momentum, there are still several hurdles for them to clear.

Past studies have shown that while consumers would like to buy sustainable products, they don‚Äôt necessarily want to pay a premium for them.


Another obstacle these startups face is the lack of funding. Although Southeast Asian plastic waste startups have seen US$229.6 billion in funding to date, 99% of it went to RWDC Industries.
But Baldwin says that‚Äôs about to change.
‚ÄúSustainability is becoming more of a priority area for investors, with the circular economy often of particular interest,‚Äù he highlights.
Rob Kaplan, an impact-focused investor and CEO of Circulate Capital agrees, noting that there has been a tenfold increase in private market funds going toward a circular economy over the last four years.
Having invested in seven companies with its US$112 million Circulate Capital Ocean Fund to date, Circulate Capital is part of a growing movement.
Another VC fund entering the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) scene is Wavemaker Partners. In October this year, the firm launched Wavemaker Impact, a climate tech venture builder that aims to reduce 10% of global carbon emissions.
Still, both these firms concede that more investment is needed for the region‚Äôs plastic waste management space to take off.
That space remains poorly defined but things may change soon as an increasingly diverse crowd of players step up to the issue and connect with each other.


In countries like Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand, international partnerships and government policies are paving the way to local circular economies.
While each country in the region faces unique challenges, similar steps can be taken to mitigate them. That bodes well for future regional cooperation, which in turn can bring Southeast Asia‚Äôs plastics ecosystem closer together. According to the World Bank, these steps include:

Increasing the sorting efficiency of waste plastics
Setting recycling targets
Mandating standards for plastics to be recyclable, especially those used in packaging
Increasing recycling capacities
Implementing industry-specific requirements to raise waste collection rates
Limiting plastic waste disposal in landfills and eliminating non-essential plastic items

Depending on their business models, plastic waste startups may not see profits even years into operation. While collecting in-demand plastics to create recycled packaging can generate immediate revenue, solutions like advanced recycling processes and high-tech bioplastics require more research and funding support.
Case in point: RWDC Industries, a Singapore-based advanced materials developer, has raised over US$263 million, which indicates that players in the space need hefty funding.
See also: Does this US$133M bet on biodegradable ‚Äòplastic‚Äô hold water?
Are these solutions enough to stem the tide?
However, even as innovators create new, more sustainable forms of plastic, tons of non-biodegradable plastic waste are still lying across Southeast Asia‚Äôs supermarkets, landfills, and the ocean.
Much of the corporate world appears to be stuck in the old ways too. Global plastic production is expected to quadruple by 2050, and today just 14% of plastic packaging is recycled worldwide.
But there is still cause for optimism.
For one, the 5Rs of waste management ‚Äì refuse, reduce, reuse, repurpose, and recycle ‚Äì offer somewhat of an outline for solving the problem. It also suggests that these startups can make an impact at different stages of the plastic-waste life cycle.",Tay Tian Wen,"Terence lee, Arpit Nayak",0,"['Premium Content', 'Visual Stories']",True,True,4

726773,2021-12-30T11:04:39,Korean beauty firm B2Link buys digital skincare community,"‚ÄúA couple of years ago, we believed that Korean beauty was dead in the global market,‚Äù Jihong Lee and Nate Sohyung Lee, the respective CEOs of skincare firms Picky and B2Link, said in an interview with¬†Tech in Asia.
The founders of the South Korean firms were reflecting on the time when tensions over the presence of the US Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile system on the Korean peninsula, which led China to restricting the import of South Korean goods and the country‚Äôs cultural influence.
China was the largest buyer of South Korea‚Äôs cosmetics products in 2019, accounting for 65.6% of outbound shipments of cosmetics produced in the latter.

Changing course to ratchet up demand in global markets, Korean beauty products aggregator B2Link has acquired Picky, a digital skincare community, to create a local lineup of cosmetic products with great potential.
The companies have not disclosed the size of the acquisition.
As part of the deal, Lee will become B2LiNK‚Äôs chief marketing officer and a member of its board, on the back of his experience, which includes stints at Google and Supercell.
B2Link will use Picky‚Äôs proprietary data to find and acquire up-and-coming brands looking to generate interest with skincare enthusiasts.

Seoul-based B2Link identifies K-beauty companies with proven track records of growing revenue. It then scoops them up and develops them into a global brand with retail and marketing assistance.

B2Link prefers brands that have an active presence in Korea but are not as well known outside the country. It is looking to acquire two to five companies every year.
‚ÄúA small brand may be successful in scaling within Korea, but it is difficult to find the right partners and operate globally in a larger market,‚Äù Lee said.
Founded in 2014, B2Link has built a network of over 500 resellers globally, including those in Shopee, Lazada, and Amazon. Picky‚Äôs market data on product revenues and country-wise spending, among others, will help B2Link scale smaller Korean beauty firms more effectively and with significant cost savings.
For example, Skin1004, B2Link‚Äôs flagship brand, is expected to wrap up 2021 with a more than 3x growth in revenue to US$25 million, along with US$4 million in profit.
Meanwhile, Picky‚Äôs registered user base has grown 10x over the past year to 250,000 potential consumers for B2Link.
Currently, B2Link‚Äôs largest markets are Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia, while Picky‚Äôs products are most popular in Singapore, Malaysia, and the Philippines.
Eliminating the stigma around male beauty
One focus for the company is to bring Korea‚Äôs enthusiasm for male beauty to these markets, and beyond. ‚ÄúWhen you think of beauty and skincare, you usually associate it with women,‚Äù said Lee. ‚ÄúBut in Korea, we are heavily pressurized into a skincare routine for men and women alike.‚Äù

Photo credit: VT Cosmetics

In fact, South Korean men spent US$683 million on skincare in 2018, accounting for nearly a fifth of the global total. They were the biggest spenders per head, shelling out about 10 times more than their US or French peers.
‚ÄúThere is a big difference between skincare and beauty, and it doesn‚Äôt always come through,‚Äù Lee added.
However, the origin of South Korea‚Äôs male beauty obsession may be more complex. Maliangkay‚Äôs¬†2010 study highlights the rejection of traditional masculinity as being powered by women against severe gender inequality.

Hello reader,
The new year is firmly within sight but the Covid-19 pandemic continues to have a seismic impact on our lives. Not only has it caused devastation across the world but it has also drastically changed the way we socialize, interact, and work. We pay through QR codes, work using either Zoom, Slack, or Google Meet (choose your poison wisely), and interact from a safe distance, wearing face masks.
Three years ago, no one would have believed masks would become a fashion accessory or the scale of the digital transformation societies have undergone to keep the global economy ticking. However, some might argue that the pandemic merely accelerated trends that were already taking root. Nonetheless, it‚Äôs somewhat assuring that we can count on human ingenuity to prepare and adapt to our ever-changing surroundings.
It‚Äôs that very ingenuity that gave birth to RedMart ‚Äì one of Singapore‚Äôs first online supermarkets ‚Äì over a decade ago. Despite a few hiccups in recent years, RedMart appears to now be making the most of the windfall in sales brought on by the pandemic. Online grocery is having a moment in Southeast Asia and RedMart is yearning for the spotlight.
Today we look at,

Red-hot revival

Since Lazada acquired RedMart in late 2016, not everything has gone to plan. Despite being integrated into Lazada‚Äôs app in Singapore in 2019, RedMart‚Äôs revenue stagnated, growing by only 1.4% in the financial year ended (FYE) 2020. The Singapore-based company, which celebrated its 10-year anniversary in October, is yet to turn a profit.
However, the pandemic‚Äôs marked influence on consumers‚Äô buying behavior has provided a lifeline to RedMart, with its impressive FYE March 2021 results paving the path toward stronger growth and, possibly, profitability.


Instant impact: RedMart got an immediate boost from the pandemic in June 2020, when it reported that its sales climbed 4x after the city-state introduced strict circuit-breaker restrictions in early April 2020.


Back to basics: RedMart‚Äôs approach is relatively asset light. It has only one fulfillment center in Singapore, which makes it easier to maintain and manage its inventory. Its improved figures in FYE 2021 were mainly due to a 50% rise in retail revenue from the sale of groceries through its online platforms.


A clear picture: RedMart‚Äôs net loss in the most recent financial year narrowed by over 4x to US$21.5 million ‚Äì its smallest on record. This means the company is as close to breakeven as it has ever been.

The latest entrant into the ride-sharing industry has pinned its hopes on a rather neglected vehicle in this space, i.e., buses. RushOwl is clearly not the only one banking on buses to establish itself in the market. The Singapore-based mobility startup raised US$650,000 in a seed round that was oversubscribed 3x and led by Silicon Solutions Partners, alongside Seeds Capital, the investment arm of Enterprise Singapore.


Generating a buzz: RushOwl works with stakeholders in smart cities to provide solutions for mobility, offering on-demand and region-to-region routes. The company said its ridership has grown 400% since 2019 as people sought more options for transportation amid the pandemic.


Dipping into SEA: RushOwl plans to use the new funds to expand its ride-sharing product, RushTrail, across the Asia Pacific next year, including Singapore and mass markets such as Vietnam and India. RushTrail uses AI to automatically facilitate rides by pooling commuter requests.


Building the blocks: RushOwl is looking to add new mobility products and partner with electric vehicle firms to beef up its ecosystem. It also offers a service for companies that need flexible commute plans for employees.

Southeast Asia‚Äôs startups are witnessing these milestones after the region saw a bumper year of stock listings, fueled by an influx of new retail investors and optimism for the region‚Äôs economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic.
Investors in the region poured over US$4.9 billion into IPOs within the first half of 2021, hunting for higher returns in public markets.
Sea Group, parent firm of ecommerce giant Shopee, was the earliest to list in the region, raising US$884 million in its initial public offering in 2017.
This year, Grab enjoyed the limelight among Southeast Asian firms. The Singapore-based company, which kicked off as a ride-hailing app, officially listed on the Nasdaq in December and now operates across 465 cities in eight countries, offering food deliveries, payments, as well as insurance and investment products.

Several big-ticket companies including Traveloka and GoTo Group (formed from the merger of Indonesia‚Äôs Gojek and Tokopedia) are also expected to list in the coming year.
Up north, Beijing‚Äôs tight scrutiny on its tech firms ‚Äì on issues ranging from data security to a loophole long used by companies to list overseas ‚Äì could also make listings of Southeast Asian firms a haven for investors looking to expand their portfolio in Asia.
The subdued Chinese tech landscape could help make the region‚Äôs IPO pipeline more geographically diverse, as India and Southeast Asia maintain a busy issuance calendar.
On the flip side, the blockbuster domestic listing of Indonesian ecommerce major Bukalapak, which saw a jump in share price that triggered the Indonesian stock exchange‚Äôs automatic rejection mechanism, has prompted other startups in the country like Blibli and Run System to abandon plans for overseas share offerings in favor of going local.
Here‚Äôs a list of some of Southeast Asia‚Äôs biggest tech listings in 2021:

2021 marked the entry of regional household names, including Coupang, Grab, Bukalapak, Zomato, and Paytm, into the realm of public markets. South Korean ecommerce firm Coupang raised US$4.5 billion in the biggest IPO by an Asian company debuting in the US since Alibaba in 2014.



In March, four of the big tech firms in Asia including Coupang, MTAR Technologies, Nazara Technologies, and EaseMyTrip took their companies public.¬†
November was also a busy month for several Indian companies this year including Nykaa, Paytm, and Policybazaar, which scheduled their listings before the end of the year. Society Pass, a Vietnam-based tech firm incorporated in the US, also went public in the same month.



Paytm, which held India‚Äôs biggest ever IPO, opened at a discounted price of 9% in its stock market debut, casting a shadow over the prospect of other tech firms in the country that planned to go public.
Similarly, Society Pass, whose shares listed at a premium of 240%, has lost nearly 90% of its stock value over the past month.
On the brighter side, Coupang, Nykaa, MTAR Technologies, and Nazara Technologies made stellar stock market debuts in 2021.
In 2019, Nick Nash, the managing partner of Asia Partners, predicted that 10 companies worth upward of a billion dollars would go public in the next 10 years in Southeast Asia. The trend is becoming more and more apparent by the year.

Perhaps it‚Äôs still early to say that interest in SPACs has subsided. Notably, super app Grab did a US listing via this route, and more are considering doing the same.
It‚Äôs clear, though, that the hype has abated from the heights it reached in early 2021. And for Traveloka, following the conventional IPO route might be a good thing, after all.
‚ÄúI think taking the SPAC route to the market is a flawed way to bring your company to the public market,‚Äù says Angus Mackintosh, an equity analyst at CrossASEAN Research. ‚ÄúIt is basically a shortcut to the market without going through the normal IPO process, which [would require you] to disclose much more and be much more open.‚Äù
Market changes, downsides
SPACs or blank-check firms are not new, points out Joel Shen, head of tech at the law firm Withers. These entities were popular in the early to mid-2000s for the same reason they are popular now: They offer an easy, cheaper, faster way to the public markets.
But then investors lost money, and SPACs fell out of favor for about a decade, Shen adds.
To be sure, there are certain differences between then and now. Most importantly, the latest SPAC sponsors ‚Äì the likes of Li and Thiel ‚Äì are considered ‚Äúbetter quality‚Äù compared to those from the mid-aughts.
But the reasons behind the dip in enthusiasm are similar. ‚ÄúInvestors think that valuations are high, or they are not convinced by the quality of target businesses,‚Äù explains Shen.
A more pivotal reason, however, was when the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reclassified SPAC warrants as liabilities earlier this year. (In the SPAC market, investors usually receive both common stock and warrants that allow them to buy the shares in the future.)
‚ÄúThis altered the fundamental economics of a SPAC,‚Äù observes Shen. Instead of making a one-time equity valuation, SPACs would need to account for warrants as debt every quarter ‚Äì a process costly enough to make SPACs less attractive.

In addition to a less-friendly regulatory climate, SPAC investors also have the right to pull their funding at any time should they feel bearish about the target company.
Indeed, more of them have been doing just that in recent months. In the third quarter, 52.4% of investors redeemed their funds, up from 21.9% in Q2 and 10% in Q1, according to Dealogic.
One example is the digital media company BuzzFeed, which merged with blank-check firm 890 Fifth Avenue Partners. After investors in its SPAC partner withdrew their investments, BuzzFeed was left with just US$16 million ‚Äì a paltry 6% of the original US$288 million.
Given the trend, it was natural for Traveloka to reconsider its options.
‚ÄúWe saw the situation, and we made a decision based on that context,‚Äù says Willson Cuaca, co-founder and managing partner of Traveloka backer East Ventures. ‚ÄúIf Traveloka forcibly went through the SPAC, it might not get any investment at all.‚Äù
The Dealogic data is consistent with analysis by The Edge Consulting Group, which found that SPACs provide stronger returns in the pre-combination period ‚Äì i.e., before they merge with a proper business and formally list, which is typically within two years.
Case in point: Grab‚Äôs share price was US$17 per share before the listing, but it is now around US$7. That said, Grab‚Äôs SPAC partner, Altimeter Growth Corp., is subject to a three-year lock-up period, and the redemption rate was effectively 0%.
On the other hand, its private investment in public equity (PIPE) investors ‚Äì including Mubadala, Temasek, and Djarum ‚Äì are not subject to the lock-up period. But PIPE investors can only begin to trade after the SEC approves the F-1 registration statement, which will take at least a month after the listing.

Investors make these pre-combination investments based on the SPAC‚Äôs management and the anticipation of making a good acquisition. There is minimal examination of the company‚Äôs financials, says Alexander Korda, The Edge‚Äôs global deals analyst.
‚ÄúThe management is really only responsible for making an acquisition before that two-year period expires,‚Äù he elaborates. ‚ÄúThey are not necessarily incentivized to bring a good company to market.‚Äù
With SPACs eager to make a ‚Äúquick buck,‚Äù the structure of the deals tends to benefit the management more than it does the end shareholders, Korda says.
This is echoed by CrossASEAN Research‚Äôs Mackintosh, who says that the SPAC route is ‚Äúa slightly more speculative instrument‚Äù than a traditional IPO.
The fact that Grab plunged 21% after its Altimeter deal shows the characteristics of SPAC investors, he argues.
‚ÄúSPAC investors are not people who are necessarily investing in Grab. They don‚Äôt know what the SPAC is going to buy. So they‚Äôre investing in the SPAC owners and their ability to execute on a merger,‚Äù Mackintosh says.
Internal circumstances
There are also concerns about momentum, considering Traveloka‚Äôs focus on travel. Although the Indonesian government has started to ease movement restrictions, travel activities are still lower than pre-pandemic levels.
Concerns over the resurgence of Covid-19 also persist. Indonesia recently detected its first omicron case, which has ignited calls to bolster health protocols. Not only does the new variant appear to spread rapidly, but it also seems to be no less severe than delta and can even evade vaccine protection.
‚ÄúBecause Traveloka complements the tourism industry, it will remain difficult until 2022, especially considering that the pandemic has not shifted to an endemic,‚Äù says Dianta Sebayang of State University of Jakarta. He serves as the head of the innovation center and business incubator at the university.
Shen of Withers, however, argues that just becoming part of the SPAC conversation is already a feat for Traveloka, which majorly focuses on the travel industry. In contrast, its peers like Grab and GoTo are diversified tech companies.
‚ÄúI think many people overlook the fact that to even get to this point was an incredible achievement for Traveloka,‚Äù Shen says. ‚ÄúAsk yourself how many travel-related businesses have shut down as a result of the pandemic.‚Äù

To Traveloka‚Äôs credit, it has been expanding its business even before the pandemic. The company started offering a buy now, pay later (BNPL) service in 2018 and took it further this year by allowing customers to use the BNPL service outside its network. Traveloka has also dipped its toes into food delivery, skills training, and medical services.

‚ÄúOut of all the Indonesian unicorns, you would have expected Traveloka to fail the worst, but it was actually one of the first to enter into these discussions about an exit,‚Äù Shen says.
Mackintosh points out that Traveloka‚Äôs ‚Äúreasonably good track record‚Äù is exactly why it does not need to enter the public markets so quickly. ‚ÄúTaking the SPAC route in some ways would smack of desperation, and they don‚Äôt need to be desperate,‚Äù he says.
Where to go from here?
As Shen puts it, getting an exit is like getting married: It makes far more sense to partner with the right person than to rush into marriage with the wrong one.
In a statement to Tech in Asia, Traveloka says it remains committed to going public, hinting that a conventional channel is still possible.
Nevertheless, Shen believes Traveloka will still pursue a US listing ‚Äúprincipally because that‚Äôs where the deepest pools of capital are in the world.‚Äù In addition, ‚Äúthe valuation will probably be richer‚Äù in that market since ‚ÄúUS ‚Äì at least Nasdaq investors ‚Äì understand tech businesses,‚Äù he adds.
Moreover, the SPAC market is not necessarily as easy as it looks, Mackintosh says. Grab, for example, initially planned to list in July, but it took the company until December to execute the plan.
‚ÄúGrab has proven that the SPAC route is not a rapid route to market,‚Äù particularly since large companies like the regional super app have ‚Äúmany moving parts,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThe SEC has made them effectively come back with a much more detailed set of numbers.‚Äù

The Edge‚Äôs Korda also contends that amid a global crisis, the SPAC market seems to be particularly risky compared to a traditional IPO.
‚ÄúIPOs are a listing mechanism that the market is used to, and SPACs are still relatively new. So the jittery nature of the pandemic market may have simply been the wrong time for SPACs to emerge as a new strategy,‚Äù he argues.
Will Traveloka‚Äôs decision deter other companies from pursuing IPOs via SPACs, though? Shen doesn‚Äôt think so.
‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt change the fact that Grab, GoTo, and all of these regional tech businesses have all raised institutional capital,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAnd when you raise institutional capital, you are on a runway to exit.‚Äù",Budi Sutrisno,"Putra Muskita, Eileen C.

Founded in May 2021, GlobalBees has a portfolio of companies across beauty and personal care, nutrition and wellness, homecare, fashion jewelry, and eyewear. Last month, GlobalBees acquired two new brands: fashion jewelry label Yellow Chimes and homecare brand Absorbia.
GlobalBees plans to use the fresh funds to expand its product portfolio, improve customer experience, ramp up hiring, and scale brands. It is also in talks with over 20 firms to develop its portfolio of digital brands.
The New Delhi-based firm will also look to invest in over 100 brands over the next three years, including those in the fast-moving consumer goods, sports, home organization, and lifestyle spaces.
The capital raise comes amid the growing popularity of a Thrasio-style business model, where companies acquire brands that sell mid-range and high-end products in categories where competition is limited. Mensa Brands, another player in the roll-up ecommerce scene, became the youngest Indian firm to hit unicorn status, reaching the milestone within six months of its launch.
Housing more than 800 brands, India is becoming a fast-growing market for direct-to-consumer brands.

726509,2021-12-28T02:00:50,RedMart‚Äôs revenue revives after year of stagnation,"Although the Covid-19 pandemic has decimated businesses worldwide, it seems to have revived Lazada‚Äôs online grocery delivery arm RedMart. The company saw its revenue rise by nearly 50% to US$307 million in the financial year ended (FYE) March 2021.

RedMart‚Äôs new 350,000 square feet West Fulfillment Center in Singapore / Photo credit: Lazada

The Singapore-based company, which just celebrated its 10-year anniversary in October, witnessed an immediate effect of the pandemic on its sales. In June 2020, RedMart reported that its sales grew 4x after the city-state introduced strict circuit-breaker restrictions in early April 2020. Just a year before, the firm was stagnating ‚Äì its revenue for FYE 2020 grew by only 1.4%.

‚ÄúIn the last 18 months, the pandemic had led a dramatic shift in online purchasing behavior, and more households have turned toward RedMart for their weekly grocery needs,‚Äù Richard Ruddy, chief retail officer and head of grocery at Lazada Singapore, told Tech in Asia in an interview in September.
According to Ruddy, the company had been integrating into the Lazada app in Singapore since the start of 2019. As a result, parts of RedMart‚Äôs business have also shifted under Lazada, and these movements were not reflected in just one set of financials.
Lazada acquired RedMart in late 2016.
A rebound in revenues
For RedMart, the rise in its numbers is a return to the high growth levels it achieved years earlier (in FYE 2019, the company posted a 44% jump in its revenues).
See also: RedMart saw 3x income growth and better margins since Lazada buyout
At the beginning of 2021, Tech in Asia reported that RedMart‚Äôs pure-play model appeared to make more sense amid the pandemic rather than the traditional brick-and-mortar model of other players. RedMart‚Äôs approach is relatively more asset-light. It has only one fulfillment center in Singapore, which makes it easier for the company to maintain and manage its inventory.

Workers at RedMart‚Äôs West Fulfillment Center / Image credit: Lazada

Its improved figures in FYE 2021 was mainly due to a 50% rise in its retail revenue from the sale of groceries through its online platforms ‚Äì its mobile app and website. In the previous financial year, these numbers stood at US$191 million, which was roughly the same as a year before. As retail revenue continues to be the largest driver for the company ‚Äì contributing to over 90% of total revenues over the years ‚Äì this was a huge factor to its sluggish growth in FYE 2020.
Meanwhile, its marketplace revenue ‚Äì which consists of commissions it received from acting as a third-party agent on the sale of goods ‚Äì declined marginally by 9% in the latest financial year. Its ‚Äúother revenues,‚Äù which include earnings from services like marketing, grew significantly by over 45%, though this segment is RedMart‚Äôs smallest source of revenue.
However, the company‚Äôs total expenses in FYE 2021 rose by nearly 40% to US$388.6 million, mainly driven by a 45% rise in its cost of sales.

In order to rein in its expenses, RedMart cut employee compensation by 86% and general and administrative expenses by more than 2x.
‚ÄúAfter the integration of both RedMart and Lazada began in 2019, certain cost considerations, such as manpower and technology, were streamlined and placed under the Lazada umbrella,‚Äù said Ruddy.
Back on the profitability path
In Tech in Asia‚Äôs earlier story on RedMart, we pointed out that profitability was an ongoing concern for the online grocery firm. The company‚Äôs operating loss grew larger with every financial year starting from FYE 2017. In FYE 2019, its operating loss widened by 25%.

The company has since made strides in reducing its operating loss over the last three financial years. In FYE 2021, its operating loss dropped by 113% to US$32.6 million. A year earlier it declined by 24%.


It‚Äôs operating loss margin has significantly improved as well, coming in at -10.6% in FYE 2021 from -42% two years earlier.
While RedMart‚Äôs gross profit margin has grown incrementally over the last three years, its net loss margin has seen a large improvement in FYE 2021, down to -7% from -42% in FYE 2020.
The company also posted its lowest net loss in the most recent financial period, with a dip of over 4x to US$21.5 million. This puts RedMart the closest it has ever been to breakeven.
The large improvement in net loss was partly due to the online grocery firm registering a non-operating income ‚Äì in the form of finance income ‚Äì amounting to US$11.2 million in FYE 2021. This figure consists of foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to its borrowings. Compare this to the past two financial years, when the company incurred finance costs instead. (It should be noted that this figure is the only difference between the company‚Äôs operating loss and net loss financials.)
While Covid-19 definitely gave RedMart a much needed boost, will it be enough to help the company deliver net profits soon?

726508,2021-12-27T05:00:32,The most active late-stage investors in Indonesia,"When startups reach late-stage funding, they usually show fast growth potential and are ready to develop to a greater level. In turn, investors take higher chances by injecting bigger amounts of cash, as it is considered less risky than their early-stage counterparts.
Late-stage funding, which refers to series C and subsequent rounds, can be traced back to as early as 2012 in Indonesia. That year, Tokopedia received an undisclosed amount of series C funding from two Japanese VC firms, namely Beenos Partners (formerly known as Netprice Partners) and SBI Investment.
Over the years, dozens of tech firms in the country have closed late-stage rounds. That said, it‚Äôs not common to reach this part of the fundraising journey, as prominent companies like produce marketplace Sayurbox and agritech firm TaniHub are still in their series B rounds.
Those who make it to series C, however, have not always received the same amount of attention. Among the industries with startups that have closed late-stage rounds, ecommerce and fintech receive the most interest, eating more than half of the funding pie.


The profiles of late-stage investors have also expanded as more of the country‚Äôs startups mature.
Several venture capitalists that typically provide seed funding have also participated in late-stage rounds. Moreover, giant foreign tech companies and investment managers such as SoftBank have also joined late-stage fundraises, betting much larger figures.
In this article, we map out the 25 most active late-stage investors in Indonesian startups. These investors have diverse backgrounds, ranging from VCs and investment banks to conventional private companies.

The listing, which includes a multicurrency debt program worth US$2 billion, is subject to certain conditions within the eligibility letter and broader market conditions.
Vertex plans to invest S$30 million (US$22.1 million) in VTAC by buying shares in the SPAC. The VC firm also intends to pour up to US$7.4 million of ‚Äúat risk‚Äù capital through the purchase of warrants in a private placement.
The bourse‚Äôs nod for the listing comes as the VC firm reportedly plans to raise at least US$400 million next year for a new fund focusing on Southeast Asia and India.
Vertex is among the top five VC firms in Southeast Asia that back the most number of unicorns in the region.
In June, Vertex Growth Fund, the global growth-stage fund of Vertex Venture Holdings, secured¬†US$15 million¬†in new commitment for its second fund from Korea Venture Investment Corporation.

Hi readers,
It was perfect timing to scrutinize Grab‚Äôs internal structure just before the company made its stock market debut. The public responded really well to our first org chart ‚Äì some of them may be curious about how Grab arranges its resources.
However, company structures tell a bigger story. They define the firm‚Äôs priorities and how decisions are made within a chain of command. Many companies sell this short, and their structures just grow organically without much planning.
As we are confronting a crisis like no other, company structures can give a firm‚Äôs leadership an easier time to determine which channels it should keep and which ones could be cut short ‚Äì without disturbing the organization‚Äôs overall flow. While remote work is drawn out, clear company structures will lead to better performance monitoring and, for some firms, hybrid designs.
That said, we will expand this type of visual on our platform and examine the organizational structures of other leading companies in the region. For now, you can check out our version of Grab‚Äôs org chart and what it says about the company‚Äôs priorities.

Details as to why the deal for the Velox Fintech acquisition did not push through weren‚Äôt disclosed in its filings.
Tech in Asia has reached out to AirAsia and Gojek representatives for comment.

In July, AirAsia announced the proposed acquisition of Gojek‚Äôs Thailand operations for a total of US$50 million. The deal reportedly involved a share swap between the two companies. In return for its Thailand arm, Gojek would get a stake in AirAsia‚Äôs super-app business.

Photo credit: Savconstantine/123RF.com

Owned by Chinese tech giant ByteDance, Tiktok became a pandemic hit as users stuck at home found themselves dancing during the lockdown. It ranked seventh on Cloudflare‚Äôs 2020 list. This year, the platform rose to no. 1 while Google and Facebook slid down to second and third place, respectively. The top ten list is as follows:

TikTok.com
Google.com
Facebook.com
Microsoft.com
Apple.com
Amazon.com
Netflix.com

Twitter.com
WhatsApp.com

However, the report stressed that this ranking does not necessarily reflect the number of users on the platforms.¬† The list is derived from Cloudflare‚Äôs public DNS resolver 1.1.1.1, ‚Äúso it‚Äôs not related to the number of unique users or visitors it gets per month,‚Äù the company explained.
‚ÄúTikTok got more internet traffic from our standpoint,‚Äù¬† the report noted. ‚ÄúFacebook is, by far, the platform with more users worldwide.‚Äù
In a separate study, TikTok was the fifth top app in terms of lifetime consumer spends.
This development comes as the Chinese app has become a venue for misinformation worldwide, from election-related¬†propaganda in the US to Covid-19 myths in Asia.

726266,2021-12-23T06:00:42,What‚Äôs behind the growth of fintech in South Korea?,"Bring up South Korea, and the first thing that comes to mind is its cultural exports. K-pop sensations like Grammy-winning group BTS and K-dramas such as the Netflix hit Squid Game series are a global phenomenon.
There‚Äôs also its consumer electronics brands. Samsung and LG, for example, are household names in many markets. But South Korea‚Äôs tech scene goes much deeper than that: For one, the country‚Äôs fintech sector is booming. Kakao Pay, the fintech arm of messaging app Kakao, is valued at about US$10 billion, while Seoul-based startup Toss raised almost US$400 million in June as part of its plans to grow its sales by 12x. The company is eyeing an initial public offering in 2025.
It turns out that this growth in the fintech space could be traced back to the consumer tech industry.

Chayee Song, manager of Seoul Fintech Lab / Photo credit: Seoul Fintech Lab

As consumers increasingly used smartphones, their behavior changed and became ‚Äúcentered on mobile,‚Äù says Song Chayee, manager of Seoul Fintech Lab, an institution that hosts incubation and acceleration programs for fintech startups. ‚ÄúThis has opened the door to the development of customized financial services for consumers.‚Äù
Success factors
One of the major reasons for this growth has been the support of the South Korean government. After recognizing the sector as an important engine for job creation and economic development, the Financial Services Commission introduced an initiative called the Financial Regulatory Sandbox in April 2019. This allows fintech-related startups to test new services with more freedom.
‚ÄúIf a startup‚Äôs apps or services are designated as an innovative financial service through this initiative, it can be temporarily exempted from needing to adhere to regulations, allowing it to quickly test and commercialize its ideas,‚Äù Song says.
She adds that the government expects banks to play a more innovative and productive role beyond their existing duties, and they‚Äôve stepped up to the plate. For Tanker, a firm that offers real estate finance solutions, its relationship with the Industrial Bank of Korea (IBK) began with the bank‚Äôs 1st Lab, a sandbox program specifically designed to facilitate hands-on application of new technologies. In Tanker‚Äôs case, it was an AI-driven automated loan review system.

Tanker CEO Lim Hyunseo / Photo credit: Tanker

‚ÄúIBK‚Äôs main interest was in process automation for various banking solutions,‚Äù observes Tanker CEO Lim Hyunseo. ‚ÄúUnder IBK‚Äôs sandbox program, we were able to prove the market viability of Blitz, our flagship B2B solution that reviews and evaluates real estate properties with greater accuracy and speed.‚Äù
The partnership also laid the foundation for Doczip, Tanker‚Äôs consumer software service that automates tedious real estate paperwork processes to create personalized and accurate real estate documents with real-time data verification.
Essentially, working with IBK allowed Tanker to flesh out and commercialize its solutions, which is similar to what Metsakuur, a facial recognition AI software startup, experienced with its partnership with Hana Bank.

‚ÄúHana Bank recently launched its updated mobile banking app, and its authentication service is enabled by our facial recognition technology,‚Äù explains Lee Seoho, chief financial officer of Metsakuur. ‚ÄúThis technology has proven to be a key factor in the success of the app‚Äôs bio-authentication methods, and this success has helped position us as a leader in the field. We‚Äôve now also extended our services to IBK and Shinhan Bank.‚Äù
Hana Bank also invested in Metsakuur‚Äôs pre-series A round. Taken as a whole, the collaboration has served as a catalyst for business expansion, and the startup is now gradually expanding its clientele to government ministries and public institutions as well as the construction and education fields.
Accelerating growth
Song points out that banks also benefit from these partnerships by giving them access to new customers with growth potential. Accelerator and incubator programs such as Seoul Fintech Lab play an important connector role, too.
‚ÄúIn creating collaborative links with existing financial companies ‚Äì including overseas ones ‚Äì we provide the networks for startups to expand into,‚Äù Song says. This network effect is strengthened further by how the accelerator offers its startups office space in Yeoui-do, a core financial hub in Seoul.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an area with many potential clients, and we‚Äôve also had the opportunity to share experiences with other tenants and receive patent and legal advice,‚Äù says Lee.
Seoul Fintech Lab also provides a variety of mentoring programs that cover various aspects of startup management, including marketing, business launch support, and employee training. Lim mentions that for Tanker‚Äôs staff onboarding, it relies on the organization instead of implementing the process itself.
Apart from its networking offerings, Seoul Fintech Lab hosts demo days and investor relations events. These activities provide startups with the opportunities to look for funding ‚Äì always a ‚Äúmajor concern‚Äù for founders, as Lee puts it.
What‚Äôs next?
As with most industries, the Covid-19 pandemic has sped up the growth of the South Korean fintech ecosystem. Song thinks that the change will continue to accelerate, and sectors such as digital banking, digital loans, stock-trading platforms, and payments will rapidly develop.
Security is a related industry that will also have to keep up with the fintech vertical‚Äôs growth, and big data will continue to play an important role in this respect.
For its part, Seoul Fintech Lab aims to keep supporting fintech startups by serving as ‚Äúa communication channel between financial authorities and companies,‚Äù says Song.
‚ÄúIt is important to deliver policies and systems to the market so they can take root. Conversely, market opinions must also be reflected in the policies,‚Äù she concludes.

Funded by the Seoul Metropolitan Government, Seoul Fintech Lab provides customized support for the various needs of fintech startups and offers office space for up to three years.

In a letter to Nirmala Sitharaman, the country‚Äôs finance minister, the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) alleged that Shopee has Chinese roots, which violates foreign direct investment (FDI) rules.
India unveiled new FDI rules last year that made government approval mandatory for foreign investments from countries that share a land border with India.
‚ÄúCAIT is seeking a ban on Shopee to protect the interests of small traders and retailers in India,‚Äù Praveen Khandelwal, CAIT‚Äôs national secretary general, told Tech in Asia.
According to the trade association, Shopee has masked its origins and commenced operations in India through SPPIN India Private Limited, an entity of Singapore-registered SPPIN I Private Limited and SPPIN II Private Limited. In turn, these two holding firms are held by SPPIN Limited, which is registered in the Cayman Islands, said CAIT in its statement.

‚ÄúThis complex structuring of entities is nothing but an attempt to hoodwink the Indian government and infuse Chinese funds into India,‚Äù stressed Khandelwal.
CAIT also claims that Shopee is controlled and operated by Tencent and Forrest Li,¬†the Chinese-born chairman and group CEO of Sea.
‚ÄúShopee is a Singaporean company committed to helping Indian small businesses thrive through our online ecommerce marketplace,‚Äù the company said in a statement to Tech in Asia. ‚ÄúWe aim to [be a] partner in India‚Äôs digital economy mission while contributing to the Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan.‚Äù
Tencent currently holds a 20% minority stake in Sea ‚Äì Shopee‚Äôs parent firm ‚Äì and is a investor in top Indian companies such as Flipkart, Byju‚Äôs, Swiggy, Udaan, and Ola.
Amid rising border tensions with China last year, India had banned over 200 Chinese apps including TikTok, Shein, PUBG, WeChat, and Alipay. The government barred the apps ‚Äúfor engaging in activities which are prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state, and public order.‚Äù
See also: Indonesia‚Äôs ecommerce race gets brutal
According to a MoneyControl report, Shopee is clocking nearly 100,000 orders per day in India and selling products at rates as low as 9 rupees (US$0.01). Shopee has hired around 300 employees and onboarded 20,000 sellers on the platform.
CAIT also alleged that Shopee uses predatory pricing tactics in every new market it enters.
Regulatory heat faced in SEA
This is not the first time that Shopee had to deal with such claims. In 2020, the company felt the heat from rivals in Indonesia for alleged anti-competitive practices. However, no action was taken against Shopee after it clarified its approach.
In Malaysia, consumer groups asked the Competition Commission to investigate Shopee for allegedly offering 3,000 ringgit (over US$700) in vouchers to sellers to shut down their stores on Lazada.

A healthy dose of startups

‚ÄúInvest in your health‚Äù is advice thrown around so regularly and nonchalantly these days that it is almost inevitably met with a shrug. Most people are already aware of the benefits of implementing a healthy lifestyle through exercise and a balanced diet. However, here we take a look at the investors who may have taken that advice one step further and are putting their money where their mouth is.


Top dogs: Antler and Seeds Capital have struck six and five deals, respectively, in Southeast Asia‚Äôs health startup ecosystem over the last two years. They are the only two investors to have had more than five deals in this space during the last 24 months.


Double dip: More than half of the 20 most active investors in Southeast Asia‚Äôs health startup landscape have doubled down on their investments. They followed up their initial investment by pumping more money in later funding rounds for startups such as AEvice Health, Doctor Anywhere, and Homage.


VCs don‚Äôt have all the fun: While the vast majority of active investors in Southeast Asia‚Äôs health scene are venture capitalists or early-stage investors, there are other important players. Most notably, Indonesia‚Äôs Sequis Life, a life insurance company, has invested in two health startups, while Seeds Capital is the investment arm of Enterprise Singapore, which is a statutory board of the Singapore government.

Strike when the iron is hot: Zepto‚Äôs series C financing round was led by Y Combinator‚Äôs Continuity Fund. The latest investment, which comes just 45 days after Zepto‚Äôs previous fundraise, lifts the company‚Äôs valuation to US$570 million, CEO Aadit Palicha told Tech in Asia.


Breakneck speed: Within five months of the company‚Äôs launch, it has set up 100 microwarehouses, each of which has the capacity to deliver over 2,500 orders per day. The startup also plans to launch microwarehouses at a faster rate in the coming months.


Dark stores for bright future: Zepto has also set up micromarkets in every city in its coverage area. Each of these micromarkets contain one or two dark stores ‚Äì units optimized for delivery-only purchases ‚Äì to serve the company‚Äôs customers. Currently, the company has about 30 to 40 dark stores in each city it covers.

725484,2021-12-22T05:00:30,Gojek alumni‚Äôs workforce startup grew 10x amid pandemic,"In Indonesia, much has been said about the rise in digital services adoption amid the Covid-19 pandemic. But the past one and a half years have also led to contractions in the labor market, with many businesses either decreasing employee salaries or exercising layoffs.
These staff cuts, however, have provided an opportunity for Sampingan, an Indonesian workforce management platform. Wisnu Nugrahadi, Sampingan‚Äôs CEO and a Gojek alum, reveals that the company now has over 1 million job seekers on its platform ‚Äì a 3x increase compared to pre-pandemic times.

The Sampingan team / Source: Sampingan

More importantly, its revenues have grown 10x between 2019 to 2021.
‚ÄúHonestly, from a marketing perspective, we didn‚Äôt spend much effort to increase the number of workers,‚Äù Nugrahadi tells Tech in Asia. ‚ÄúPerhaps the name Sampingan itself is already well-known by job seekers.‚Äù
As App Annie data shows, Sampingan‚Äôs downloads were sluggish at the end of 2019 but then rose rapidly in mid-2020. That was enough to attract US$5 million in series A funding earlier this year, which brought the company‚Äôs total investment to US$7.1 million.

Digitizing the old ways
Sampingan ‚Äì which translates to ‚Äúside job‚Äù ‚Äì was founded in 2018 by Nugrahadi, Dimas Pramudya Putra, and Margana Mohamad. It initially aimed to help companies find pre-vetted workers (primarily blue-collar workers) on demand, but it has since expanded to offer other services, including an end-to-end SaaS platform for enterprise and brand management.
Nugrahadi and Putra are both Gojek alumni ‚Äì Nugrahadi was an operations manager, while Putra was the decacorn‚Äôs head of product growth. The initial idea for Sampingan came from a problem that Nugrahadi encountered when he was with the super app: The company had a worker management system that was run completely manually.
Sampingan also differs from freelance marketplaces like Fiverr and Upwork in a few ways. First, it is a closed enterprise platform. A client needs to sign up through Sampingan‚Äôs sales team ‚Äì and do so with an official company representative ‚Äì instead of just going through the usual online sign-up process.
The platform itself is also enterprise-focused. Customers can carry out processes like recruitment, employee tracking and management, as well as payroll administration, all on Sampingan.
‚ÄúWhat we do at Sampingan is actually simplifying the [recruitment and worker management] process by automating most of it,‚Äù says Nugrahadi.

(From left) Sampingan founders Wisnu Nugrahadi, Dimas Pramudya Putra, and Margana Mohamad / Source: Sampingan

But perhaps a larger distinction between Sampingan and other services is its blue-collar focus. Where Fiverr and Upwork concentrate on white-collar tasks (like data entry and graphic design), Sampingan‚Äôs pool includes warehouse workers, couriers, field marketing representatives, and the like. While the company started by focusing on part-time or freelance workers, it has now expanded into full-time positions as well.
There‚Äôs high demand for such workers from Sampingan‚Äôs clients, which include big names like logistics firms Paxel and Shopee Xpress, as well as the likes of Bukalapak and e-wallet LinkAja. In turn, there is also no shortage of supply, especially due to the pandemic. As of April 2020, a total of 70 million Indonesians work in the informal sector, a segment that has been directly affected by Covid-19.
Of course, there are existing companies that serve this need, but they tend to be either SaaS startups ‚Äì that provide just a system ‚Äì or traditional workforce companies that supply workers without the tech.
‚ÄúAt Sampingan, we provide both because we see the two as one package that can‚Äôt work without the other,‚Äù Nugrahadi explains. ‚ÄúWhat really differentiates us is that we are fully end-to-end.‚Äù
10x revenue growth
Sampingan‚Äôs holistic approach appears to resonate with clients. Revenue has grown 10x in two years, Nugrahadi says, though he declined to reveal exact figures.
The company generates income from businesses that use its platform for things like recruitment, management, and payroll services. A company spokesperson says it charges custom rates depending on each client.
So far, more than 150 companies use its platform, and Nugrahadi says the startup targets big enterprises with more than 150 employees.
The CEO ascribes much of Sampingan‚Äôs revenue growth to companies being more open to trying digital recruitment and management processes.
For decades, businesses operated on traditional face-to-face methods, ‚Äúbut during the pandemic, there were many limitations,‚Äù he explains.

The hope is that these companies will see time and cost savings and that the solutions will stick.
‚ÄúWorkers can take up a whole day in public transport just for interviews and screening, and if we think about that, it‚Äôs one whole day when they could‚Äôve spent it earning money,‚Äù Nugrahadi says. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a cost there, and not just from the company‚Äôs side, but also the jobseeker‚Äôs. That‚Äôs what we want to solve.‚Äù
Not surprisingly, growth amid the pandemic has also attracted investor attention.
‚ÄúAs a series A-focused VC, we invest based on growth potential, and the key areas we look for are team, market size, and product-market fit. On all three fronts, supporting Sampingan was a compelling and clear decision for us,‚Äù says Gavin Teo, general partner at Altara Ventures, which led Sampingan‚Äôs series A round. Other participating firms in the round include Golden Gate Ventures, Access Ventures, and Antler.
A nascent space
Sampingan is not the only startup in Indonesia tackling the workforce sector. Other names that provide similar end-to-end platforms include Workmate (backed by Grab Ventures, Atlas Ventures) , MyRobin Indonesia (backed by Bamboo Sea Ventures), AdaKerja (backed by Beenext), and Job2Go (backed by Bansea).
Workmate, previously known as Helpster, is a Singapore-based company that expanded to Indonesia in 2017. Similar to Sampingan, it lets customers automate recruitment, onboarding, and scheduling, as well as track time and attendance and conduct performance analytics processes. MyRobin, AdaKerja, and Job2Go also have more or less similar features.

However, the space is ultimately still nascent. Out of these companies, Workmate has raised the largest amount of funding so far, with US$20.6 million. The others have altogether raised a total of less than US$10 million in disclosed funding, with Sampingan making up the bulk.
But Altara Ventures‚Äô Teo says the segment has huge potential, highlighting that half of Indonesia‚Äôs 250 million population is currently eligible for blue-collar and freelance jobs.
‚ÄúAs a young startup, the biggest challenge for Sampingan is where to focus scarce time and attention to stay in the game,‚Äù Teo explains. ‚ÄúIndonesia is rapidly developing, and with that comes ever-increasing expectations from workers and employers to do more, faster.‚Äù
While Sampingan is not yet profitable, Nugrahadi says that the company aims to get there by automating more of its internal processes, an area where it will focus much of the spending from its freshly raised funds. The firm is also targeting clients in other industries ‚Äì its management platform is currently available for logistics firms, advertising agencies, and companies in the online-to-offline sector.
The startup will also add new features like insurance benefits, earned wage access loans (i.e., salary advances), as well as professional networking for blue-collar workers. Indonesia will also remain its main market.
‚ÄúThese offerings further deepen the network and drive value and retention beyond job placement, which we expect to be a game changer for Indonesian workers, their employers who use Sampingan, and the Indonesian blue-collar economy,‚Äù adds Teo.",Jofie Yordan,Putra Muskita and Jaclyn Tiu ,0,"['Premium Content', 'Profiles']",True,True,6

The startup, which targets India‚Äôs growing but fragmented fish and seafood market, leverages technology to streamline the supply process for retailers and help farmers get better prices. Captain Fresh has around 10 distribution facilities and nearly 30 procurement centers in 20 cities across the country.
In the last 12 months, the number of transactions on the platform surged almost 7x while its revenues have grown 6x, the company told Tech in Asia. Captain Fresh currently serves 2,000 customers, up from 300 to 400 customers a year ago. Its supplier base has also increased from 50 to 400 during the same period.
Captain Fresh was launched in 2019 by Utham Gowda, who previously served as executive vice president at Nekkanti Sea Foods.
Gowda told Tech in Asia that his interested in the market began in 2015, when he advised a seafood exporter that was raising funds. His stint with Nekkanti helped him understand how the four-decade-old firm was navigating through the structural complexities of the industry.

These are just some of the many grocery store items that consumers need to have within 1o minutes.
Zepto is one of the players in a growing crowd of quick commerce apps that have become beneficiaries of a lockdown-fueled funding bonanza.

Founded earlier this year by Aadit Palicha¬†and¬†Kaivalya Vohra ‚Äì both dropouts from Stanford University ‚Äì Zepto aims to deliver groceries in 10 minutes through a network of stores.¬†
The company has raised US$100 million in its series C financing round led by Y Combinator‚Äôs Continuity Fund, along with participation from Glade Brook, Nexus, Breyer Capital, Lachy Groom, Global Founders Capital, and Contrary Capital, among others.
The latest investment, which comes 45 days after Zepto‚Äôs previous fundraise, lifts the company‚Äôs valuation to US$570 million, CEO Palicha told Tech in Asia.
Zepto‚Äôs new capital will be used to expand its coverage across multiple cities in India and to ramp up hiring across functions including operations, supply chain, marketing, finance, product, engineering, and human resources.
‚ÄúDelivering groceries in 10 minutes is a game changing experience for customers and it reflects in our strong product-market fit metrics,‚Äù said Vohra, who serves as the company‚Äôs CTO. ‚ÄúThis data has given us the confidence to expand the 10-minute model across the country.‚Äù
Zepto said it has been tripling its user base every month. Its month-on-month buyer retention stands at 65%, with an 88-point net promoter score, a customer loyalty and satisfaction metric.
Within five months of the company‚Äôs launch, it has set up 100 microwarehouses ‚Äì each of which has the capacity to deliver over 2,500 orders per day. Zepto also plans to launch microwarehouses at a faster rate in the coming months.
A quick pivot
Zepto initially kicked off with a slower delivery model, ensuring orders reached customers in about an hour. The company pivoted to quick commerce in August 2021, and are now adding 100,000 new installs every week, with 60% of them being women.

‚ÄúThe need for quicker delivery stems from our frustration as understocked bachelors to wait for six to seven days to get essential grocery delivered,‚Äù Palicha said, referring to himself and Vohra.
The CEO added that the quick delivery model works from a product-market fit standpoint as it is a high-frequency task, and reducing the friction of consumers in the same brings added value to the business.
India‚Äôs online grocery market was valued at US$2.9 billion in 2020, and it is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37.1% by 2028.
‚ÄúSince Aadit and Kaivalya went through Y Combinator, we have observed that they‚Äôre exceptional founders who bring relentless focus and ‚ÄòDoordash-like‚Äô execution to the quick commerce model,‚Äù said Anu Hariharan, partner at Y Combinator‚Äôs Continuity Fund.
10 minutes? Really?
Zepto‚Äôs model is a combination of right network designing, locations, and logistics, which can build operational efficiency in getting the order dispatched within 58 seconds.

‚ÄúIf you have an efficient internal processes, your outflow can be much faster than a traditional retail store or a traditional ecommerce warehouse,‚Äù Palicha said.
Zepto has set up micromarkets in every city in its coverage area. Each of these micromarkets contain one or two dark stores ‚Äì units optimized for delivery-only service ‚Äì to serve the company‚Äôs customers. This establishment of a micromarket helps delivery executives focus on specific areas, provides them with a stable flow of orders, and improves their delivery timing.
Currently, the company has about 30 to 40 dark stores in every city in its coverage area, and it is hiring hundreds of delivery executives each day as part of its expansion plans. Zepto aims to increase its total workforce by 3x over the next six to nine months.
The company selects micromarkets based on factors including geographic centricity, road patterns, traffic data, last-mile supply availability, and real estate prices. It builds its own data sets and models to ascertain the same.

Hello reader,
Timing is everything, not only in business, but also in life, love, career, and finance. Yet, the stars very rarely align for things to perfectly fall in place. Hence, the birth of AI, machine learning, data science, and any tool or field of study that can help us crack the code of the magic crystal ball. The best we‚Äôve currently got is bite-sized insights of the future, based on predictive behavioral patterns.
While a number of tech firms in Southeast Asia are either making their debut on public markets or well on their way toward an IPO, Vietnam‚Äôs startups are nowhere to be found. As you may have already guessed, timing has a thing or two to do with it. The country‚Äôs startup ecosystem is at a nascent stage compared to those in some of its Southeast Asian neighbors.
Therefore, the dash toward the IPO goldmine for Southeast Asia‚Äôs startups just came a bit too early for Vietnam. It‚Äôs not a case of playing catch up for Vietnam‚Äôs startups ‚Äì rather, it‚Äôs a case of arriving late.
Today we look at,

Why no VN startup showed up to SEA‚Äôs IPO party

Premium summary
There‚Äôs no need to hurry

This may shock you, but an IPO is not always the endgame for startups. No one is rushing to cash a smaller check (I know, so 2000s, right?). The time may not be ripe for Vietnam‚Äôs IPO hopefuls to jump into the stock market, but their founders are unlikely to be losing any sleep over it.
Vietnam‚Äôs startups are bursting with potential and are privately well funded, with the total deal value in the country skyrocketing to US$1.3 billion in the first half of this year.


More ways than one: In a report titled ‚ÄúSEA Exit Landscape 2.0,‚Äù Golden Gate Ventures, which has focused on Vietnam since the mid-2010s, forecasted a total of 468 exits between 2020 and 2022 for the whole region. About 80% of these exits will be driven by mergers and acquisitions, 15% by secondary sales, and only about 5% by IPOs.


Not blessed with abundance: Vietnam doesn‚Äôt have a lot of high-value tech startups for now, with the list only consisting of three unicorns ‚Äì VNG, VNLife, and Sky Mavis ‚Äì and two soonicorns in Tiki and MoMo. Among these tech stars, Sky Mavis ‚Äì developer of the globally popular blockchain game Axie Infinity ‚Äì is an exception. The startup is technically considered a Vietnamese unicorn, though it is not incorporated in the country.


A loophole: Regulations are a big factor in the race to go public, even for major corporations. For example, foreign shareholders are barred from owning more than 50% of a company in certain sectors in Vietnam. The listed entity must be approved by the State Securities Commission (SSC), even for an offshore listing. The SSC requirement, however, can be circumvented if a non-Vietnamese entity is listed.

Bloomberg, is that you?

A classic case of mistaken identity. Nansen, which has been called the ‚ÄúBloomberg for digital assets‚Äù by investors, recently picked up US$75 million in a series B financing round. Scams have been rife in the crypto world and this Singapore-based startup caters to the growing need for analysis and research into cryptocurrencies as investors look to secure their digital assets in a highly volatile market.


One for all: Nansen is used by both retail and institutional investors, counting the likes of Three Arrows Capital, DeFiance Capital, Genesis Block Ventures, Not3Lau Capital, Polychain, YBS Capital, and Acheron Trading as its clients. The platform is also used by Polygon, Lido, and Sky Mavis.


More than a collectible: The blockchain analytics firm anticipates an explosion of various use cases for non-fungible tokens (NFTs), going beyond just being collectibles. Large companies and brands may offer discounts to NFT owners, which could lead to a change in their advertising models. Case in point: Nike recently entered the metaverse with its purchase of RTFKT, an NFT collectibles and fashion startup


Not just for the money: Nansen expects its backers such as Accel, GIC, Andreessen Horowitz, Tiger Global, and SCB 10X to help it improve its annual recurring revenue using their experience in dealing with startups in Southeast Asia. This will also allow the firm to reach institutional players who can have access to chain data.

¬†
Org Chart maps out the people at the top of Asia‚Äôs most prominent tech companies. Who are the key decision-makers? How are the teams organized? What does it tell us about the company‚Äôs priorities? We kick off this new series with Southeast Asian super app Grab.
The Grab story started in 2012 with its two co-founders, Harvard graduates Anthony Tan and Hooi Ling Tan, and their goal of creating a safer way to book taxis in their home country of Malaysia.
By 2020, it became a decacorn with around 7,000 employees¬†spread across eight Southeast Asian markets. Its business has expanded from transportation to include logistics, digital payments, and financial services.

While Grab‚Äôs management team has expanded over the years, some things have stayed the same. For one, both Tans continue to helm the company. Joining them at the top is group president Ming Maa, who came on board in 2016 following stints at Goldman Sachs and SoftBank Group.

What‚Äôs apparent from Grab‚Äôs organizational chart is the importance it places on its largest market. All country heads report to Russell Cohen ‚Äì the group managing director of operations and head of mobility ‚Äì except for Indonesia‚Äôs.
Neneng Goenadi, the country managing director for Grab Indonesia, reports directly to the top level. She oversees three executives in charge of a specific region in the market: west Indonesia, east Indonesia, and Jabodetabek (the Greater Jakarta area).
Aside from having a country lead, Indonesia is also the only Grab market that has its own president. Ridzki Kramadibrata, Goenadi‚Äôs predecessor, fills that role.
This isn‚Äôt a surprise considering Grab‚Äôs outsized presence in Indonesia and its close relationship with the country‚Äôs government.
Here are a few more observations:

Cheryl Goh was offered the job before the app existed, and she continues to lead marketing today.
Theo Vassilakis, an alum of Google, Facebook, and Microsoft, served as Grab‚Äôs group chief technology officer until June 2019. It‚Äôs unclear whether his role has since been filled.
Linda Hoglund left Klarna ‚Äì a buy now, pay later company based in Sweden ‚Äì to become Grab‚Äôs first chief financial officer in 2016. She stepped down after a year and was replaced by Peter Oey.
Two executives, Demi Yu and Michael Truong, came from Uber after the US-based firm‚Äôs Southeast Asian business was acquired by Grab in 2018. They currently serve as Grab‚Äôs head of deliveries and head of product, respectively.
Reuben Lai started leading Grab‚Äôs digibank in late 2021 after previously being in charge of the company‚Äôs financial services vertical, which is now managed by Kell Jay Lim.

725720,2021-12-20T02:00:16,Huawei‚Äôs hackathon aims to empower young tech talents,"The Covid-19 pandemic has changed many aspects of how we approach life, and the shift has been particularly drastic for those finishing up with university. Many fresh graduates have decided to eschew traditional nine-to-fives in favor of setting up their own tech companies, focusing on a variety of areas such as education and web security.
However, while virtual solutions of all sorts have popped up, there remain problems that need to be solved. Sustainability issues continue to plague Asia Pacific, for example, with the region performing poorly in the environmental targets of the United Nations‚Äô 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Additionally, while borders are slowly beginning to open up, there‚Äôs still a lot of uncertainty over the future of the hospitality and tourism industries.
Problems like these are what these fresh graduates turned tech entrepreneurs are aiming to solve, and it‚Äôs more important than ever to help them bring their tech solutions to fruition.
‚ÄúNo market for these ideas‚Äù
It‚Äôs clear that the need to innovate remains crucial, but fresh ideas alone won‚Äôt make a huge impact.
According to Leo Jiang, Huawei‚Äôs chief digital officer for Asia Pacific, the pandemic may have accelerated adoption of existing technologies, but the missing key ingredient is the talent needed to build the next step.
‚ÄúWith the pandemic, things changed so fast that the talent growth couldn‚Äôt keep up,‚Äù he says.

Leo Jiang, Huawei‚Äôs chief digital officer for Asia Pacific / Photo credit: Huawei

The talent crunch is a well-established problem in tech circles. Some research suggests that by 2030, there will be a shortage of 47 million tech talents in Asia Pacific alone. So where will the tech professionals of the future come from?
An obvious answer would be the latest crop of students and young graduates. However, while many of them have grown up surrounded by tech, the ability to transform ideas into actual solutions is much harder without access to practical experience, opportunities, and connections.
Jiang shares that he faced similar issues 20 years ago when he was in his final year of university. It was crucial to find a company that could sponsor students like him for projects, ‚Äúbut it was so difficult to find even a single company that could give us a project to work on,‚Äù he says.
As a result, most students ended up building something on their own. For Jiang, it was a data capture software, but it wasn‚Äôt the most informed of processes. As a student, he says his innovations were stymied by a lack of opportunities to develop his skills on a practical level.
‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt have any commercialization opportunities, because there was no market for these ideas,‚Äù he recounts. ‚ÄúAt the time, I just thought The Matrix was pretty hot, and I thought of hackers as great role models. That‚Äôs why I did it.‚Äù
A lot has changed since Jiang‚Äôs time as a student, but there are new challenges for today‚Äôs innovators to overcome, such as selecting the right technology for their projects and figuring out how to access the resources needed for them.
‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs the first thing that young developers need to understand: which platform, which technology do I need to put my hands on?‚Äù Jiang says. ‚ÄúAnd once you do, then it‚Äôs about the cost of learning, the cost of commercializing that learning into a prototype.‚Äù
Hacking for greatness
Understanding the need to support students and their ambitions to become tech entrepreneurs, Huawei will make a US$100 million investment to cultivate 10,000 developers, the company announced at its 2021 Spark Founders Summit.
To make that vision a reality, the Chinese tech giant will host its inaugural Huawei Cloud Spark Hackathon Singapore in early 2022 to open up opportunities for students, aspiring entrepreneurs, and technology enthusiasts to gain experience and training. Through the program, participants will be invited to plan and build an original product on Huawei Cloud‚Äôs proprietary cloud computing platform. These solutions must be based on a number of categories, including sustainability, travel, education, and healthtech.
Teams will then pitch their prototypes to a panel of judges for the chance to win a US$15,000 cash prize and potential job opportunities within Huawei and its portfolio companies.

Jiang explains that the idea behind Huawei‚Äôs hackathon was to not just give young tech talents a chance at winning some cash or scoring a job, but also to connect them directly to players in the tech industry. To that end, startup founders from Huawei‚Äôs portfolio companies will also attend the hackathon.
‚ÄúStudents will be coached by the industry leaders who have not only the technical background, but also commercialization experience,‚Äù Jiang says. ‚ÄúThese are real-world startup founders and technical experts who can provide the training and know-how to guide you in the right direction.‚Äù
Hackathon with a difference
Huawei‚Äôs event sets itself apart because of two core components: the underlying technology, and the emphasis on education.
Participants of the Huawei Cloud Spark hackathon will build their prototypes on the Huawei Cloud platform with integrated features like the next generation GaussDB distributed database software, which offers no risk of data loss. Huawei will also give participants access to solutions that are already being used in the market, like Australian startup Pi Exchange‚Äôs AI/ML tool. With this, the event provides young talents the opportunity to play around and learn with otherwise inaccessible enterprise-grade software.
The hackathon also emphasizes the education aspect. All event participants have the opportunity to be trained on Huawei‚Äôs cloud service via the Huawei Certified ICT Associate (HCIA) program, which can be accessed as either a self-paced learning module or a five-day course led by an instructor.
Through the HCIA educational framework, Jiang says participants can also pursue certification that can improve their future career prospects.
First stop: Singapore
For Huawei, the hackathon represents something more than just a fun competition with a lucrative cash prize ‚Äì it‚Äôs also about the resources needed for future innovations.
‚ÄúCloud and AI are the most fundamental ingredients to build the digital future,‚Äù Jiang predicts. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anyone starting a company from scratch in the traditional way anymore, so these are essential tools and knowledge.‚Äù
However, the hackathon is just one step in the long journey toward developing a robust cloud and technology ecosystem. Jiang describes a multi-pronged strategy where Huawei will continue investing in new product and service offerings to better serve startups, and it will also roll out more initiatives to develop talent.
The first iteration of the Huawei Cloud Spark Hackathon is set to take place in Singapore in mid-January 2022, and is focused on giving HCIA certifications to at least 500 students. In the future, Huawei plans to hold hackathons in other countries like Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, and the Philippines.
‚ÄúWe definitely want to train and educate as many students as we can, and help them find a job in order to contribute to the social and economic side of things in Singapore,‚Äù Jiang says. ‚ÄúImagine if 20 years ago, someone said their hackathon would not only connect you with the industry, but educate you while also providing tools and training. Wouldn‚Äôt that be amazing for a student?‚Äù

Hi readers,
I‚Äôm not a sports fan, but I‚Äôve dabbled in startups long enough to know that business is a team sport. And as with any team sport, not every player is going to stay when management changes hands.
Some may depart because of a conflict of beliefs and egos. Others, whose contracts are about to expire, have more practical reasons to up and leave. Many in the Lazada mafia would likely resonate with these reasons.
Although members of the company‚Äôs alumni network were behind several high-profile startups as early as 2012, the scale of the group truly skyrocketed after Alibaba‚Äôs acquisition of Lazada in 2016.
Several characteristics distinguish the Lazada mafia from others. For one, the companies in the network are very young. Our analysis found that 73% of Lazada alumni startups were founded after the Alibaba acquisition. Most of them are also in the pre-series and series A stages.
Second, the group is striking out on its own path. Unlike the Alibaba mafia which rode the same waves as the Chinese tech giant, most Lazada alumni startups are venturing into industries that Lazada does not have a presence in.
These proteges may no longer play for team Lazada, but that doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôve shaken off all ties with the ecommerce major. Some, like Una Brands and Branded Group, are leveling the ecommerce playing field for Lazada-affiliated merchants, and others may help realize the ecommerce firm‚Äôs bigger aspirations yet.

Hello reader,
We‚Äôre less than a week away from my favorite time of the year: Christmas!
As the year comes to a close, Santa and his elves are coming out of hibernation and I‚Äôm itching to binge watch classic Christmas movies like Home Alone and The Santa Clause with my brothers. Meanwhile, my family‚Äôs already begun eating way too much. But before all that, I‚Äôve got a fair bit of work to finish up so I can enjoy my holidays in peace.
And it seems like the Southeast Asian industry has got the same idea: While startups in the region raised more than US$4 billion, eight companies made our M&amp;A list this week. They‚Äôve got to pencil those last few investor meetings in the calendar before going on leave, after all.
To all of you reading ‚Äì both naughty and nice ‚Äì here‚Äôs wishing you a great last couple weeks of the year!
