Additionally, we’re commemorating International Women’s Day this week on Tech in Asia. You can find the great content around the occasion here.Hello reader,Happy International Women’s Day! Nearly 100 years ago, March 8 was officially designated as a day of recognition for women, celebrating their achievements across all aspects of life as they work toward greater gender equality.The world has changed tremendously since then – great strides have been made in the name of equality around the world, and we’re seeing many incredible women come up, break traditional molds, and drive change.However, there’s more that needs to be done to truly level the playing field, and we all have a part to play in this journey.That’s why this week on Tech in Asia, we’re looking to make a difference by driving female representation in Southeast Asia’s tech and startup scene and highlighting the stories of amazing women in the space who have broken barriers and achieved success.Our COO, Maria Li, kicked off this effort on Monday with an amazing list of 100+ Women in Power in the region, and we’ve got lots of other great content coming up on the site over the next few days to mark the occasion.Be sure to check it out! In the meantime, we’ve got the latest news summed up for you as always.Today we look at:How crypto influencing can go wrong What fresh funding will do for this loyalty and ecommerce platform Other newsy highlights such as this former Coinbase exec’s new startup in Singapore and this investment firm’s new VC arm Premium summaryWhen crypto influencing goes badImage credit: Timmy LoenIf you’re on social media these days, there’s no lack of content around cryptocurrency trading and other related fields such as NFTs. In Singapore, it’s pretty common to see social media influencers talking about digital coins and the like, which has led to some legal and ethical concerns.The Crypto King: An example of this in action is the story of Ryan Tan, co-founder of Night Owl Cinematics, a YouTube channel and production firm known for its lifestyle and comedy videos. In late 2021, Tan started posting about crypto on his Instagram stories, talking about his two-week foray into NFTs and play-to-earn (P2E) games. He also shared a link to help his followers set up accounts on the popular Metamask crypto wallet as well as two centralized crypto exchanges and created Telegram groups for followers to get into crypto under his guidance.Not an expert: In the time since Tan first invited followers to invest their money into the two P2E games he promoted, both tokens have crashed, and Tan has not posted about them or made appearances in the crypto-related Telegram channels he runs. When he was confronted about his actions earlier in the year after the first crash, Tan maintained that any losses were not his fault and that he had only shared his own thoughts and opinions on these games.The power of an influencer: Experts have a different take on the situation. Many believe crypto influencers should have relevant experience in the sector before even promoting anything, and some law experts say Tan could be liable for the losses experienced by his followers because of his actions.Read more: Singapore’s ‘Crypto King’ has no clothesStartup spotlightZapping your way to successPhoto credit: ZapKa-ching!

735806,2022-03-08T08:00:23,The entrepreneurial experience of SEA’s female founders,entrepreneurial-experience-seas-female-founders,visual-story,"Southeast Asia’s potential – and success – as a startup ecosystem is well-documented. There’s no doubt that founders from the region are capable of building thriving businesses that can compete on the global stage.However, even as Southeast Asia’s startup scene matures, it still has some work to do. For instance, there’s a stark gender imbalance among the founders of its rising startups. According to Tech in Asia data, only seven out of the region’s 80 top-funded startups have a woman in their founding teams, even though women make up 42% of the workforceand half of the population.Women founders have also reported challenges with accessing funding and marketsas well as contending withlong-standing biases about their capabilities and strengths.Nevertheless, it’s an exciting time to be a founder in Southeast Asia, especially for female founders, who are carving out new paths for themselves.As part of our 2022 International Women’s Day campaign, Tech in Asiadecided to explore the experiences of the region’s female founders by conducting a qualitative survey.To understand their lived experiences, we went beyond the numbers and gathered insights from the anecdotes they shared. We then analyzed their responses and sorted them thematically, identifying common themes that emerged from the stories of these founders.We received nearly 60 responses for our survey and interviewed seven founders to gain a deeper perspective.While this survey is not representative of all female founders in Southeast Asia, we hope it offers a snapshot of their journeys and gives a closer look into what it means to be a woman in the region’s tech and startup ecosystem. Starting up isn’t easy, but anything worth doing is well worth the effort.Survey and interview responses have been edited for brevity and clarity.Entrepreneurship is often described as being a rollercoaster – with good reason. Regardless of race, gender, industry, or geography, founders will agree: There are plenty of highs and just as many lows. We asked our survey respondents what they thought were the best and hardest aspects of the startup founder life, and we captured a breadth of experiences.Five key themes emerged around the best part of being a founder: innovation, freedom, impact, inspiration, and passion.﻿A majority of our respondents cited how satisfying it was to innovate and create, while some expressed how much they enjoy the freedom that comes with being an entrepreneur. For others, making an impact, sparking inspiration, or pursuing their passion via their startups is what they like the most about being a founder.There were a handful of responses that didn’t fall within these five categories, such as how entrepreneurship allows them to embark on a journey of learning or be different from the crowd.﻿﻿But of course, starting up isn’t all roses. When our respondents were asked about the hardest part of their entrepreneurial journeys, over a quarter of them talked about how work can get overwhelming and the negative effects of such a burden. They also mentioned the loneliness, self-doubt, fear, pressure, and volatility that come with taking this path.﻿Other responses discussed the complications of scaling a business, people issues, and dealing with VCs.Running your own business is hard, but some parts of it are much harder than others, especially for women entrepreneurs.“Every entrepreneurial journey is unique, regardless of whether you are a female or a male founder. Women, however, may experience these challenges in different ways than men,” says Susli Lie, partner at Monk’s Hill Ventures and co-founder of education finance firm ErudiFi. “The lived experience of many women I have spoken to suggests that these challenges are very real, albeit nuanced. Some of these challenges are a result of self-limiting beliefs and often perpetuated by our society, both socially as well as in professional settings.” Broadly speaking, the most common stumbling blocks standing in the way of our survey participants were talent, leadership, bias and doubt, and funding.TalentLike any entrepreneur in any industry, our respondents grapple with bringing in people with the right skills and mindsets, given the constraints over money and resources. Over 33.3% of female founders named talent as the most significant challenge they’ve encountered so far.LeadershipRoughly 17.5% of the founders we surveyed cited leadership-related struggles as their greatest challenge. Most are going at it for the first time and find they have to steer a company towards success while juggling everyday responsibilities.“There’s so many things happening at all times, and trying to really keep a clear head with everything that’s going on can be super difficult, since there’s so many other things that you need [to do] to manage this company as well,” shares Jane von Rabenau, CEO at Indonesian retail startup Siklus. Bias and doubtAbout 17.5% of the respondents said that apart from bias, they also deal with doubt stemming from internal battles – feeling imposter syndrome or second-guessing one’s decisions – and external sources, such as investors, potential customers, and even family and friends.Bias is a typical hurdle for female founders in Southeast Asia – an issue that we’ll delve into later in this piece.FundingOver 14% of our survey participants discussed the difficulty of securing funds. This corresponds with larger trends observed in the industry: Women-led firms raised just 16.5% of the US$8.6 billion that went into Southeast Asian startups in 2020, and funding into women-led startups also dropped globallybetween 2019 and 2020.There are several reasons why female founders don’t raise as much funding as their male peers.Some respondents noted that female founders tend to be more risk-averse and more conservative with their numbers. While this cautiousness has helped them build and lead profitable, sustainable businesses, it can work against them during pitches with investors, who are typically focused on growth. Meanwhile, others cited biases against women founders and problems with forging the connections required to get their foot in the door.Over 77% of our respondents felt that being female has made a difference in their entrepreneurial journeys. They regard it as a positive element, particularly crediting how women can tap into empathyto produce results and propel their companies to success.“It allows you to ​​be able to understand the other side and get to the finish line, get to that agreement,” says Xendit’s Wijaya.Empathic leadership also influences how female founders approach other aspects of running a startup, such as hiring and managing teams.“Women can bring a different perspective to the workplace, thus adding a diversity of opinion and representation,” adds Monk’s Hill Ventures’ Lie.Other respondents identified positive differences such as the sense of community that comes from being a female founder and opportunities like women-focused accelerators or incubator programs.On the flip side are some negative elements such as biases against female founders. Of the respondents who said that being a woman made a difference, over 36% said that they were underestimated and had trouble making their voices heard and getting their foot in the door. Meanwhile, approximately 13% shared that it made fundraising harder.Other negative differences included feeling a greater penalty for prioritizing work over their personal lives and wrestling with more doubt than their male peers.Nearly 72% of the female founders we surveyed said they have encountered some form of bias on their entrepreneurial journeys. This was not limited to gender – they also pinpointed biases around age, education, and the industries they were operating in.﻿Founders also reported being seen as too old or too young to be in business, faced skepticism about their education or work background, and misconceptions about the markets and industries they operate. These biases don’t exist in isolation, and they’re often compounded on a founder’s journey.“There’s a constant questioning of how young I am or how inexperienced I might be,” shares Sriram of Shiok Meats. She also had to deal with assumptions about what she and her co-founder, Ka Yi Ling, aimed to do and the niche market they wanted to enter.“When we first started out, we had a number of people tell us: ‘Oh, this is so new! You guys are great scientists – you’ve worked at ASTAR. Why would you leave your high-paying jobs to do this? Have you gone crazy? Nobody has heard of cell-based meat in Southeast Asia. You’ll never raise money; you’ll never form a company,’” she adds.Carmina Bayombong, founder and CEO of education fintech company InvestEd, echoes this sentiment.“There’s unconscious bias when you’re female. There’s another layer of unconscious bias when you’re an impact entrepreneur– I experience double the bias,” she contends.Much has been said about driving entrepreneurship in Southeast Asia, but what about getting more women into the scene? Our respondents think that better support networks, investments, representation, and education are necessary to make that happen.Over 33% of respondents said that having more communities that can offer resources and guidance to female founders as well as women-focused training programs and grants are instrumental to encouraging more women to go into entrepreneurship.Investments are also vital, with nearly one-fifth of respondents highlighting it as a key driver. Funding would open up more opportunities for female founders and enable them to take the first step in getting their businesses off the ground.Greater representation matters as well, with more than 17% of respondents saying that showcasing stories of female founders at all stages of the journey would help inspire new entrepreneurs. After all, it’s hard to be what you cannot envision.Around 7% of respondents believe that education could serve as a stepping stone to entrepreneurship. The work needs to start in schools, where young women can be encouraged to go into STEMfields, seek mentorship, and find support to dream bigger and take more risks.Aside from these four main elements, working to eliminate bias and creating an ecosystem that can support women in the workforce at a structural level can help put more women on the entrepreneur path.The founders we surveyed are bullish on the future of female entrepreneurship in Southeast Asia. The overall sentiment is that as the ecosystem flourishes, gender parity and equality becomes more attainable, and more women join the space, a brighter tomorrow lies ahead.Over 33% of respondents said that the growth of a greater ecosystem around female founders is one of their aspirations. They want to have more community networks and support as well as funding and opportunities. They also advocate for a “virtuous cycle,” where successful entrepreneurs mentor and reinvest in a new generation of founders.More than 31% of respondents are eager to see more women starting up, making headlines for their success, and building great businesses.And approximately 26% hope that Southeast Asia’s startup scene will achieve true equity and equality.This includes moving past biases, seeing more women in leadership positions and getting access to opportunities as much as male founders do. And beyond just having the unique experiences and perspectives of women be cherished and acknowledged, they envision a future where female entrepreneurship isn’t anything remarkable in and of itself, but just a fact of life.We asked our respondents to share some advice for other women who also want to walk the path of entrepreneurship. While they talked about different aspects of their journey, they all had one thing to say if you’re thinking about starting up: Just do it. It’s an incredible time to be a founder in Southeast Asia, and the future is certainly a bright one.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿A huge thank you to all the female founders who participated in this survey and shared their stories with us – this wouldn’t have been possible without you.This content was produced by Tech in Asia Studios, which connects brands with Asia’s tech community.

Last year, the country also welcomed 42 new unicorns.While India now mints new unicorns almost as quickly as China, there’s still a gulf between the startup ecosystems of the two neighbors.Not quite toe to toe yetUnlike China, many of India’s top tech companies today are spin-offs – like Tech Mahindra and Tata Consulting – from large, family-owned conglomerates. All of these firms were established between 1968 to 2000.These spin-offs all operate in the IT services sector and are the largest Indian tech companies by market value. Tata Consulting, for example, largely provides tech consulting and business process outsourcing services.Despite their age, India’s top 10 tech companies’ combined valuation trailed their Chinese peers’ as a percentage of their home countries’ gross domestic product between 2016 to 2020. India nearly closed the gap with China in 2018, when the latter was locked in a trade war with the US.In absolute terms, the combined valuation of the top 10 Chinese tech firms is over fourfold that of their Indian peers.The contrast is even more stark when we look at the fifth to tenth largest Indian tech companies, which mostly comprise recent entrants like food delivery firm Zomato and digital payments provider Paytm. Here, Chinese tech companies’ combined valuation is more than sevenfold that of their Indian counterparts.What’s holding India’s tech scene back?Essentially, India sets itself apart from China in two ways: a leaderboard dominated by stalwart tech spinoffs that don’t pull their weight in market value and a late boom in significantly smaller unicorns. But what explains these issues for the world’s fifth-largest economy?For one, large spinoffs like Tata Consulting and Tech Mahindra have been slow to pivot away from low-value legacy businesses that scale linearly. To grow them, employee headcounts must tick up.Although these industry titans have tried to decouple growth from headcount since 2013, stagnant operating margins suggest that these efforts have not yet borne fruit.Other factors, such as a weakening cost arbitrage advantage and clients’ growing preference for automation and in-house operations, have also stunted the growth of India’s tech conglomerates.What about India’s late boom in relatively small unicorns? Here, India’s public sector appears to trail China’s in terms of support to startups.The duration of entrepreneurial finance policies active between 1995 to 2019 in India suggests that they could be outdated and less responsive to startups’ fast-changing needs.One India-based founder Tech in Asia spoke to complained of “many hurdles to jump” and having to appeal to bureaucrats who “rarely understand the product or opportunity.” The founder declined to be named.In contrast, China’s government has been more proactive in supporting startups.Since launching a broad startup ecosystem development strategy in 2015, China climbed the ranks of the global innovation index, going from the 35th spot in 2013 to the 14th position in 2020. Today, the country ranks 12th among 132 economies worldwide.Trends in China and India’s information and communications technology (ICT) patent grant rate in recent years also reveal a gulf in innovation. To quote Indian tech entrepreneur Vinayak Dalmia, India’s startup ecosystem is “too many apps and not enough innovation.”Making India Tech 2.0 workCan India’s new tech unicorns climb the leaderboard as their Chinese peers have?The good news is that Modi’s government has already doubled down on supporting the country’s startups.Earlier last month, the government allocated US$37.8 million to the flagship Startup India Seed Fund Scheme – nearly three times bigger than earlier estimates.Other measures include simplifying tax procedures, allowing self-certification for select labor and environmental laws, and doing away with over 25,000 compliance regulations.Unlike many past initiatives that targeted specific demographics or industries, the country’s latest slew of support schemes for startups are founder and sector-agnostic.Still, it’ll likely take more than just generous funding and easier compliance for India’s tech startups to square up to China’s. India’s leading entrepreneurship hubs also lag behind its neighbor’s in terms of talent availability, research and patent activity, and access to customers.Modi’s initiatives are just step one of three in developing the country’s startups. The path to building institutions that promote innovation and “handholding” young innovators may not be as clear-cut.","Legacy businesses still dominate Indian tech, but the government is turning its attention toward younger upstarts.",530158,Tay Tian Wen,True,Terence Lee and Arpit Nayak,0,"['Premium Content', 'Visual Stories']","['Asia', 'China', 'china vs tech giants', 'Chinese tech giants', 'data visualization', 'India']",False,,True,True,True,False,4

681468,2022-03-07T12:15:22,The leading Asian tech players eyeing an IPO in 2022 and beyond (Updated),leading-asian-tech-players-eyeing-ipo-2021,post,"This is the latest version of the article that was previously updated on February 17, 2022. Many startups dream about going public. It allows them to raise much more capital than from private equity investors and venture capital firms. Equity mutual funds in the US alone manage US$8.4 trillion domestically- that’s six times the comparable value handled by buyout funds and 18 times what venture capital oversee.Recently, there seems to be a rush for an initial public offering among tech startups. Among US companies, some of the biggest-ever tech IPOs by capital raised took place in 2020. Food delivery platform DoorDash and vacation rental firm Airbnb listed last December, while software provider Snowflake went public in September.Sea listed on NYSE / Photo credit: NYSEIn Asia, some tech startups that did an IPO last year include short-video platform and TikTok rival Kuaishou, which raised US$5.4 billion in its Hong Kong listing in January 2021, and JD.com, which raised US$3.8 billion in its secondary listing, also in Hong Kong.Asian firms are increasingly opting for IPOs as tech stocks boomed amid the pandemic. As such, several startups in the region are looking to strike while the iron’s hot.Tech in Asia’s analysis shows that 95 tech startups across China, India, and Southeast Asia are reportedly planning for an IPO this year and beyond. Out of this number, 40 startups could collectively raise over US$27.83 billion.However, this figure could potentially surpass US$23.24 billion since heavyweights like Traveloka and ByteDance haven’t set or disclosed their target fundraising amounts.Most of the Asian startups looking to list on the bourses come from the ecommerce space, followed by fintech, artificial intelligence, and ride-hailing.Our analysis also shows that the US is one of the most sought-after destinations for these companies, especially for Southeast Asian firms. This isn’t surprising, given the success of New York Stock Exchange-listed Sea Group, which currently has a market valuation of over US$120 billion. That’s several times larger than any of the top tech firms in the region.Meanwhile, most Indian companies are choosing to go public in their home markets, except for Walmart-owned ecommerce player Flipkart, fintech merchants platform Pine Labs, and advertising tech startup InMobi, which want to list on the US stock market.Following the US and Indian markets is the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, which is seeing more homecoming listings from Chinese firms. This is a change from a few years earlier, when Chinese companies favored listing on the US stock exchanges.One reason for this could be the heightened political tensions between China and the US, which drove Chinese tech firms to seek out exchanges closer to home.These companies could also be concerned about being removed from US stock markets. Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, one of China’s major chipmakers, ceased its trading shares in the US in January after it was added to a trade blacklist by the US government.In December 2020, the US House of Representatives passed a bill that allows the delisting of Chinese firms that don’t let US inspectors review their auditors’ work for three consecutive years. The legislation was adopted by the US Securities and Exchange Commission in March.Soaring SPACsSome startups are choosing a different route to go public. Last year, blank-check or special purpose acquisition companies (SPAC) IPOs accounted for most of the growth in the IPO market in the US compared to 2019.Listing via a SPAC is less time-consuming, taking around six months instead of the usual six to nine months for a traditional IPO. Going the blank-check route also offers upfront liquidity and greater certainty around valuation.While only a minority of firms are considering a SPAC, some of Southeast Asia’s leading tech startups, such as Traveloka and GoTo Group, are taking this alternative. The only company outside the region that might opt to merge with a blank-check firm for a US listing is India’s Flipkart.As soon as these tech startups go public, their early investors can finally cash out and make a fortune.Doris Yu had initially worked on this story.","There are over 95 tech startups across the region planning an IPO, and 40 of them could collectively raise over US$27.83 billion.",470877,Deepti Sri,True,"Collin Furtado, Terence Lee, and Eileen C.

We break down the big and messy topics of Asia’s tech and startup community. Get the newsletter in your inbox everyday with a Premium subscription. Additionally, we’re commemorating International Women’s Day this week on Tech in Asia. You can find the great content around the occasion here.Hello reader,You have to hand it to Mark Zuckerberg. When the Facebook founder chose to rename the company’s parent firm to Meta Platforms to build an alternate digital world known as the metaverse, he was mercilessly criticized.He was considered just another middle-aged tech billionaire chasing a childhood dream, similar to what Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and Tesla’s Elon Musk did with space rockets.And yet his timing was impeccable. While Wall Street has been fanning the hype, Southeast Asia has witnessed the quiet rise of metaverse builder RFox. The bootstrapped startup, which was launched right before the crypto boom, plans to create localized metaverses in the region.In today’s big story, my colleague Nikita decodes the metaverse possibilities through RFox.Today we look at:A Southeast Asian startup that has a well-stocked arsenal in the race to build metaversesA record number of investments flowing into one of Asia’s fast-emerging sectorsOther newsy highlights such as Grab’s latest quarterly results, and a Singapore-based social investment platform’s expansion plans.P.S.: Tech in Asia is celebrating International Women’s Day this week with lots of great content on the site – keep an eye out for it!Premium summaryThe future is hereImage credit: Timmy LoenRFox founder Ben Fairbank describes his version of a metaverse as a big box with hooks, where anyone can plug any application or blockchain into the box.While the Vietnam-headquartered company has been flying under the radar all this while, it may step into the limelight once it launches an immersive retail and entertainment-centric metaverse to the public sometime in the middle of the year.RFox also has a well-stocked arsenal in the battle to build metaverses, where 25% of people will fancy spending at least one hour a day for work, shopping, education, social, or entertainment purposes.Going places: The Valt is a global virtual reality metaverse. RFox aims to create localized Valts next, starting with the Philippines later this year and then moving on to Vietnam and Indonesia. Services such as food courts, clothing businesses, and billboard advertisements will be locally influenced.Deal town: RFox has a tie-up with Lazada Philippines for cashback and rewards that will go live once the Valt is open. The partnership will focus on ecommerce livestreaming, where Lazada will offer an 8% cashback to RFox for every purchase through the livestream content. The metaverse startup is also looking for people who can bring value regarding networking or partnerships.Metaverse user manual: The Valt is looking to attract traffic to its four quarters. Auctions for the virtual plots of two of these areas – the art-focused quarter Callinova and gaming district Arkamoto – are already over. RFox wants to help businesses set up shop in its virtual world without the need to worry about building an audience from scratch.Read more: The quiet rise of a startup that sold $2.5m of virtual landNews spotlightFleshing out alternative proteinsAsia Pacific is fast emerging as a hotbed for alternative protein startups, with record investments flowing into the sector. Annual capital invested in the region’s alternative protein startups grew by 92% to US$312 million in 2021.Top dog: Some of the biggest deals in Asia Pacific last year include Singapore-based Next Gen Foods scooping up a record-breaking US$30 million in seed funding and Australia-based V2food raising US$110 million in its series B round.Funding flow: Startups in the plant-based category dominated investments, securing nearly 70% of funds flowing into Asia Pacific’s alternative protein sector. Firms in this category also secured more money compared to their peers in other regions. Meanwhile, startups in the cultivated meat and fermentation categories received 20% and 10% of investments in the region, respectively.Vegan unicorns: Asia is said to have the potential to become a bona fide hotbed of alternative protein unicorns. Meanwhile, North America may become a minority player in the global plant-based meat sector this year – a far cry from when it once accounted for almost 100% of the world’s alternative protein investments.In partnership withFighting the changing face of fraudFor as long as there’s been money to be made, fraud has existed, going from tactics like counterfeit money and fake checks to new strategies like identity fraud and promo abuse. As Southeast Asia continues to digitalize, more people are coming online for the first time, creating more opportunities for fraudsters.According to a report by GrabDefence and Forrester, seven out of 10 surveyed organizations experienced fraud in the last 12 months, significantly impacting their businesses. And as firms try to fight fraud, they have to strike a balance between preventing major risks and keeping the customer journey frictionless.Sign up for GrabDefence’s upcoming webinar, The State of Fraud in Southeast Asia 2022: Insights To Protect Your Business. On March 23, industry experts will weigh in on the region’s fraud landscape, share insights from the GrabDefence and Forrester report, and discuss recommendations for businesses to enhance their fraud management capabilities.Quick bytes1️⃣ Grab hits speed bumpsGrab saw its revenue plunge by over 44% to US$122 million in the fourth quarter of 2021.
